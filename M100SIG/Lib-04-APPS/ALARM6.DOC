                                 Alarm Clock

The program is an alarm clock that will ring at any time on any day that you 
wish.
    The screen displays the time in Greenwich Mean Time and below that your 
time zone.  Your time zone is set for Eastern Standard Time.  Change this to 
your time zone.  The program will remember your time zone and the other entries
on the labels that need to stay the same.
    F1-Turns on and off the regular beep.  At 15 and 45 minites it beeps once, 
at 30 minites it beeps twice, and on the hour it beeps the number of the hour. 
This doesn't stop the alarm from ringing.
    F2-Turns on and off the alarm so that it will not ring on any alarm that 
passes.
    F3-Changes the way that the time is displayed from the 12 hour clock to the
24 hour clock and back.
    F4-Changes the time from daylight savings time to standard time.
    F5-Turn on and off the labels, exept the F5 label itself.
    F6-Sets the time, date, and day of the week.  This is covered more later.
    F7-Will change time zones and displays the next time zone.
    F8-Returns you to the main menu.

    When you first run the program you need to set your time zone and then set 
the time, and to do this you press F6 then you will get the following labels:
    F1-Sets the day of the week.
    F2-Sets the month.
    F3-Sets the day of the month.
    F4-Sets the year.
    F5-Sets the hour.
    F6-Sets the minites.
    F7-Sets the seconds to 0.
    F8-Returns to the regular time modes.
    When you press one of the function keys the reverse block moves over the 
label for the one you pressed.  You then press the up arrow to add one to the 
part you are changing, or press the down arrow to subtract one from the part 
you selected.
    When you are done press F8 and then enter.
    To move from one function key to another you can also press the left or 
right arrow.
    To run this program right you need to use your power supply and type in the
command POWER CONT so that the computer will stay on all the time.
    To enter an alarm time go to TEXT using ALARM.DO as the file name, and Make
the fallowing entries:

    Date <Enter>
    Time <Enter>
    Message <Enter>
    Date <Enter>
    Time <Enter>
    And so on and so forth.

    An example of this is:

10/31/85
20:30:00
This is a test of my Alarm Program
10/31/85
08:30:00P
This is a test of my Alarm Program

    You can also enter just the time and message for an alarm that you want to 
ring the same time every day.
    The time needs to be entered in 24 hour time format like the way the Model 
100 clock runs, or entered followed by a "P" like 08:30:00p for 8:30 PM.  
Morning times are the same eather way, so you don't need to worry about them.
    The Alarm will sound on the time zone that you select and not on GMT.
    The program will now accept up to ten entries but you can change that in 
line number 11 by changing the 10 to what ever you want.  Just remember the 
more you put in the more memory you use.
    The alarm will ring until you press any key, and if another alarm comes 
along before you do press a key it will change the message and continue the 
alarm.
