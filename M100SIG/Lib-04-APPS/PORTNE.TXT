INTRODUCTION

 

	The Hewlett-Packard (HP) 110 portable computer helped
save as well as generate over one million dollars through
business negotiations in two years. As a negotiating tool,
the portable computer can benefit you.  

	

THE HP 110 PORTABLE OFFICE 



	The HP 110 laptop computer weighs 10 pounds and runs on
rechargeable batteries for about 16 hours.    



	The 272 kilobytes (K) random access memory (RAM) is
large enough to run fairly complex programs and can be used
for information storage.  Over 100 typewritten pages can be
stored in RAM after the machine is turned off. 



	The read only memory (ROM), contains word processing,
spreadsheet (Lotus 1-2-3), and telecommunications programs. 
There is no need for a disk drive unless you want to run
other programs or store additional information.



	 A built-in modem allows for communication with other
computers. A battery operated printer and disk drive are
also available.. 



	 The complete system is truly portable and can be used
almost anywhere. It is now possible to carry large amounts
of information and processing capabilities in one small
package.   



WHY A PORTABLE COMPUTER IN NEGOTIATIONS?

	Webster's dictionary defines the word negotiate as "to
confer with another so as to arrive at the settlement of
some matter".  Analysis and communication of information are
key factors in any negotiation.

	After purchasing the HP 110 in July, 1984, I wondered
how this portable computer could help in business
negotiations.  Our company actively negotiated several
million dollars worth of oil investments yearly.  



	What Ilearned was that the HP 110 computer, disk drive,
and printer can help the negotiator manage information by:



	o  Storing raw data - facts and figures.

	o  Analyzing and organizing information - Lotus 1-2-3
	   and other programs.

	o  Presenting information - screen or printed 

	o  Sending or gathering new data - modem

                                                



	 The HP 110 solves the historic problem of always
needing more information during negotiatons.  Let's take a
look at various negotiation situations.



CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS



	Since 1974, I've been involved in two areas of the oil
and gas business:  1) purchasing oil and gas reserves and,
2) drilling for oil and gas.  A large portion of that time
has been spent in out of town contract negotiations with:



	o  Sellers

	o  Partners 

	o  Investors

	o  Lenders

	o  Consultants



	Typically, negotiations start with a standard printed
contract to which additions and deletions are made. When
both parties are satisfied with the final wording, the
document is retyped and signed.  This process usually
requires several meetings.



	A portable computer with printer is more efficient
because the original contract can be easily changed with the
word processor.  When a final agreement is reached, the
contract is printed and ready for signatures.   

	

	The following advantages have been noticed:

 

	o  Less legal time associated with contract
	   negotiations resulting in lower legal expenses. 

	o  Faster contract negotiations resulting in reduced
	   personel and travel costs. 

	o  Fewer negotiation failures due to lack of
	   flexibility. 

	o  Higher percentage of contracts successfully
	   negotiated and signed.



	In the following case histories, one program that used
known as "Exflo" was developed by the writer.  This economic
analysis program was specifically developed for use during
out of town negotiations. 

	

	Case History 1:  During an out of town meeting with
partners in Utah, terms of a proposed investment were being
negotiated.  A final agreement needed to be reached the
following day.



	Various economic scenarios were analyzed using Lotus
1-2-3, resulting in terms agreeable to all parties.  The HP
110 and printer were used to make and print these changes to
the original proposal.

	

	The next day this negotiated agreement was signed which
ultimately resulted in the successful closing of a one
million dollar private placement offering.

	 



GOING THROUGH THE NUMBERS

  

	Like most investments, economical petroleum ventures
are not on the market long.  Quick and accurate analysis is
a critical first negotiating step.  Do you want to pursue
this investment further or not?



	Until the introduction of portable computers like the
HP 110, detailed economic analysis of petroleum investments
were run in the home office.  Sometimes a prospect was sold
before economic evaluation was completed.



	With the HP 110 and spreadsheet programs like Lotus
1-2-3, economic analysis can actually be done in the
seller's office.  A recommendation on whether to pursue an
investment further can usually be made before leaving the
seller's office.



	This technique of economic evaluation has the following
advantages:



	o  Improved communications between buyer, seller,
	   partners, and investors.

	o  Surfacing of key economic questions that need to be
	   answered before negotiations can proceed.

	o  Quicker review of each potential investment. 

	o  Fewer meetings between involved parties concerning
	   economic questions.

	o  Faster and better informed decision making resulting
	   in fewer lost investment opportunities.

	o  Consistency of evaluation.



	The following two case histories illustrate how the HP
110 was used to help answer key economic questions during
the early phases of negotiation. 



	Case History 2:  During an out of town meeting with
investors in an oil drilling project, one member wanted to
know the economic impact of a change in oil prices from
current market to several hypothetical levels.  Rather than
breaking off discussions until the answer was in hand, the
entire economics were re-run in the conference room using
the HP 110.  The results were printed out on the portable
printer and distributed to the group 10 minutes later.

 

	Consequently, momentum and group dynamics were
maintained resulting in a proposed plan of purchase for this
ten million dollar acquisition.  Since the meeting was not
postponed another meeting was not needed, saving a least one
day's travel time and cost for the 5 member group (about
$5000).    



	Case History 3:  In another setting, the portable was
used to show that an investment shouldn't be made.  When our 
group was in a Midland, Texas conference room, it had to
make a final decision to commit to or drop a $500,000
drilling program. 



	 Upon arriving at the seller's office, the we
determined that the seller had presumed higher oil prices
and lower reserves than calculated by our group.  The
portable computer was used to recalculate the seller's final
geologic and engineering data.  These calculations showed a
big discrepancy: The original economics showed a 3.5:1
return on investment, compared to the new calculations of a
2.5:1 return. 



	For this reason the group invested in an alternate
program with higher reward potential.



GROUP AGREEMENT



	Usually a number of people are involved in the
negotiation of large oil and gas transactions.  Before a
final agreement can be reached, a consensus of opinion is
needed.  Typical of the groups involved are:



	o  Legal

	o  Investment

	o  Technical

	o  Financial



	The built-in modem allows rapid transmittal of
information gathered on a particular investment while still
away from the office.  This becomes more important on
extended business trips.  Each group can start analysis of
the information immediately, instead of waiting for your
return to the office.



STYLES OF NEGOTIATION AND THE PORTABLE COMPUTER



	Negotiating styles are as varied as the topic, the
people and the companies involved.



 	During negotiations an agenda is usually followed which
can be stored in the portable computer and referred to
later. Notes, changes and comments may be added at any time.



	The operating noise of the HP 110 is quiet when
compared to other portable computers.  Since programs can be
loaded from ROM and information stored in RAM, noise from a
disk drive can be eliminated.  Also,the keyboard is almost
silent. The inaudibility of this computer is important when
the negotiating group is listening or concentrating.



	As negotiations progress, certain stalling tactics are
sometimes encountered to gain an advantage and must be dealt
with as they occur.   An extra nights stay or even a return
trip to the office might be necessary before negotiations
continue.  This can be very expensive for the out of town
negotiator.   

	

	 One type of stall is created by a question that can't
be answered without additional information or analysis. 
"What if" questions are frequently raised.  An example is: 
"What if the price of oil in your economics is changed?  How
does this effect the bottom line?"  The HP 110 and Lotus
1-2-3 can answer this question within a few minutes.



	Another tactic usually starts with the presentation of
a computer printout showing a bottom-line number. Each
assumption in the analysis is briefly discussed.  The seller
then wants an immediate decision.



	The HP 110 can be used to help check each assumption
and then calculate a new set of economics.  These can then
be printed on the portable printer and compared to the
seller's economics.  Key differences are presented and
discussed, thus avoiding a dicision made upon the seller's
economics.



WHO ARE YOU?



	If you are associated with a well-known company, your
credentials are established by them. Otherwise, you need to
prove your credibility, a critical factor in any
negotiation.  The portable computer helps give people an
idea of your ability and knowledge



	For example:  most programs and contracts I use are
petroleum related and follow industry standards.  This
information determines my business and how I conduct it. The
same is true for other businesses that use computers to
store information.



	Your credentials are easier to substantiate with the HP
110

	  



CONCLUSIONS



	The HP 110, portable printer, and disk drive saves time
and money during negotiations. Pertinent information can be
stored and easily accessed as needed.  Using the portable
computer for contracts and bottom-line negotiations have
been especially useful.



	Historically, advantage has gone to the party hosting
the negotiations.  The host can easily access his office
information.  Since the portable computer allows you to take
your "office" to the out of town negotiating table, the host
no longer has the "home turf advantage".

  

	Once you have used this portable office in your
business transactions, you will realize the tremendous
benefits of such a setup.
