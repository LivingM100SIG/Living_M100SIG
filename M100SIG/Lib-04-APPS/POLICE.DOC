POLICE.BA, Version 7.2,is now ready to load.
After an initial screen,POLICE.BA displays a Caption Check List.
This list suggests the order in which information should appear in the report.
The user enters the number of the option desired.
The user will then be prompted for relevant information .
When the prompt File Name appears,the user should type the name of the report.
That is,if it's different than the one displayed.
After the computer adds the information to the report,it returns to the menu.
While in POLICE.BA,the user may find the following helpful.
