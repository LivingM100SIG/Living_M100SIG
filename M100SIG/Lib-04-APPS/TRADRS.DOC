.TRADRS (TRade ADdResS files) is an adaptation of Paul Carnell's NTSWAP.  It trades any designated file into ADRS.DO (and places 
ADRS.DO's former contents into a file whose name is the first line in the former ADRS.DO file).  Thus several ADRS lists can be 
maintained individually (club mailing list, products customers, SIG members CIS numbers for EMAIL6, church phone tree ladder, 
Christmas cards addresses, etc.).  As well, the higher-powererd search functions of the M100's ADDRSS mode are  thus available.   
THE FIRST LINE OF EACH ADRS FILE MUST BE THE NAME OF THAT FILE.  IT MUST NOT BE "ADRS" AND MUST NOT INCLUDE ANY EXTENSION (however 
ADRS1 or ADRSxx are usable forms).  Trading address files is especially usefull in conjuntion with ENVLOP.NEW in XA0 --the program 
that addresses envelopes with automatic inclusion of the return address, and EMAIL6.MM in XA1--the auto electronic-mailing program 
that requires all sending addresses to be listed in ADRS.DO.  Running the program a second time after using the particular ADRS-? 
file helps keep filenames and contents appropiate to one another.
