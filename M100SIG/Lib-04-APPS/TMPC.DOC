                                   Getting Started

          In this section, we will show how you can get started with TMPC
          by loading it from the cassette tape.  Whether you want to
          proceed with the tutorial that follows or dive right in to
          "exploring" TMPC, on your own, you should read and follow these
          instructions carefully.

                              Machine Language Program

          TMPC is a machine language program.  If you have other machine
          language programs loaded in you Model 100, take care that you do
          not overwrite them with TMPC.  You should save them to either
          cassette or CO file; see the instructions that came with them. 
          Eventually, you will want to read Lesson 5 of the tutorial, which
          describes a valuable utility for using multiple machine language
          programs.

          Once you have ensured that your machine language programs are
          safe (or if you have none), take the TMPC cassette and examine
          it.  It should have a CLEAR command show on the cassette.  For
          your future reference, copy this command into this manual:


          CLEAR 100,_______________________________________________


          If you get an OM error, you have too many files in your machine
          to fit TMPC.  Remove some of them until you can give the CLEAR
          command without error messages.

          Next, connect your cassette unit to the Model 100. (For more
          detailed instructions, see page 189 of the Model 100 owners'
          manual.)  Put the TMPC tape into the cassette player, and give
          the command:


          CLOADM "TMPC"


          If you have problems with the cassette player and think that the
          recording on the cassette has been spoiled, try again elsewhere
          on the tape.  All of the files on the TMPC tape appear more than
          once.  Be sure your volume is set correctly; we recommend a Radio
          Shack CCR-81 (or equivalent at volume 4-6.

          If all goes well, you should follow the CLOADM command with
          another command:



                                       Page: 1





                                   Getting Started



          CLOAD "TMPC"


          This command loads a BASIC program called TMPC.BA off of the
          tape.  After the program loads, give the command:


          SAVE "TMPC"


          This command creates a BASIC file called TMPC.BA.  When you are
          ready to enter TMPC, run this BASIC file from the menu.  (If you
          are planning on doing the tutorial do not run it yet.)  We do not
          recommend any other way to enter TMPC, although if you know
          something about machine language programs, you may prefer some
          other method. 


                             Preparing for the Tutorial

          If you plan on reading the tutorial - and we highly recommend it
          - do not run TMPC yet.  First, you must load one more file from
          cassette.

          The tutorial takes place on January 11, 1984.  While still in
          BASIC, give the following commands:


          DATE$="01/11/84":MENU


          Next, enter the TEXT program; when the prompt, "file to edit?"
          appears, enter, "TOM".  When you see the blank screen, press
          [F2].  The prompt, "Load from:" will appear; once again, enter,
          "TOM".  The cassette player will load in a document file used in
          the tutorial.

          TOM.DO is called a "task file".  Although you can examine a task
          file with TEXT, never change its contents this way, unless you
          are very confident of what you are doing.  (The technical
          reference section can tell you more.)  Otherwise, you risk
          rendering the file useless by creating an "internal error". 
          Press [F8] to return to the menu; you are now ready for Lesson 1
          of the tutorial.  Whenever the tutorial says to "enter TMPC",
          select TMPC.BA on the menu and press [ENTER].

                          Lesson 1: Setting the Daily List

          In this series of five tutorials, we will follow along with Tom,
          a fictitious TMPC user.  You should have loaded his "task file"
          (called TOM.DO) from the tape to use during the tutorials. 
          Instructions for loading this file are in the previous section. 
          One warning: don't get ahead of yourself.  If you do, you might
          inadvertently change TOM.DO so that a later example will not
          work.  If you want to play around, change the d=task file to one
          of your own - you can find instructions for doing this at the
          beginning of Lesson 5.

          You should also have changed DATE$ to "01/11/84".  This is very
          important.  If you do not change the date to match the dates in
          TOM.DO, few of the examples in these tutorials will work.  You
          should make sure that DATE$ is correctly set whenever you use
          TMPC with TOM.DO

          Once you have set the date, enter TMPC.  You will see the
          following screen appear:

          [Ed. Note: Throughout this online version of the TMPC manual, the
          "stick-figure" will be represented by "%"]


          You should think of the screen as a room in a building.  The
          white areas are corridors, and the stick-figure is you.  This
          room, or screen, contains nothing but corridors and information. 
          The "information" is today's date, today's weekday, the number of
          the day this year, and the number of days remaining in this year. 
          (The Model 100's weekday can be wrong, but the weekday on this
          screen always agrees with the date.)

                          Lesson 1: Setting the Daily List

          This screen is always the first one you will see upon entering
          TMPC.  So, start from here to follow Tom through his daily
          procedure of setting today's workload for himself.  As the first
          step, he presses [Down-arrow] (just once) to move to the screen
          below this one:

          This screen, like the one above it, contains only corridors and
          information.  Tom moves on without stopping by pressing
          [Right-Arrow].  Yet another screen appears:

          This screen shows today's appointments and memos.  Notice the two
          numbers in the inverse video portion of the screen.  The "0"
          means that there are no items in the list above what are shown;
          the "2" at the bottom means that two more items are off the
          bottom of the screen.

          Tom looks at the appointments.  Both of the meetings are going to
          be relatively short, he knows; further, because he is a counselor
          for Junior Achievement, he normally works late on Wednesdays, in
          order to go straight there from work.  Then, he presses
          [Right-Arrow] into the box with a "p", which stands for "page
          forward".  Do this and you will see the screen change as follows:

          Tom looks at these deadlines: a standard activity report due in
          just two more business days, and a sales-related presentation to
          a potential customer in a week.  With a rough idea of how busy
          the day will be, and what the most urgent deadlines are, Tom
          proceeds to look at what remains undone from yesterday.

          Press [Left-Arrow] and [Down-Arrow] to show another screen:

          This screen enumerates the things to be done today.  Since this
          is the first time Tom has entered TMPC today, these are things
          left undone from yesterday.  TMPC categorizes activities in two
          different ways:


             # One of three levels of stress.  Stress "A" jobs are
               exhausting, stress "B" jobs are average, and stress "C: jobs
               are light or enjoyable.  Of course, you will have your own
               ideas about what is difficult and what is easy or fun.  This
               screen categorizes to-dos by stress level.

             # One of three levels of priority.  Priority 1 to-dos should
               be done immediately; priority 2 to-dos should be done within
               a few days, and priority 3 jobs can be done when convenient. 
               This screen shows nothing about priority, but other screens
               do.


          In our example, Tom sees that there is one of each type of
          project left undone from yesterday; he presses [Down-Arrow] to
          look at them.  The following screen appears:



                                      Screen 11
                      ******************* ********************

                      ****************************************

                      ****                                ****

                      Cycle*****Done******Cancel****Delay*LPT*



          The text in the box describes one of the things left undone.  Tom
          looks at all three by pressing the [F1] key ("cycle") several
          times.  He decides that the two items for Synquil better be
          finished today.  However, the 8086 reading is low priority; it
          should wait until some other time.  He presses [F5] ("delay") to
          move the project back to the warehouse.

          There are two places where TMPC stores to-dos.  The warehouse is
          a holding area where you put every task that you are thinking
          about doing or must do "some time".  From the warehouse, you
          select a daily list at the beginning of each workday.  Your goal
          should always be to finish all of your to-dos on the daily list
          before close of business.  Tom left three things undone; he is
          not unduly annoyed, since an unexpected (and productive)
          conversation pre-empted three of his to-dos.  There are no really
          pressing deadlines this week.

          Tom now has two to-dos on his daily list.  Normally, he shoots
          for two with "grade A stress", two or three with "grade B
          stress", and a few with "grade C stress" - never more than ten in
          all.  To complete the selection, he moves to another screen. 
          Press [Up-Arrow] [Left-Arrow].  (On the way, notice that the
          "grade C stress" number is now zero, since that to-do has been
          moved back into the warehouse.)  The screen you see will look
          like this:

                                       Page: 6

          The text shown is for the first to-do in the warehouse.  The
          warehouse always sorts to-dos by priority first; within priority,
          it sorts by increasing stress.  This is because you should do the
          fun, urgent things right away.  Accordingly, the to-do displayed
          is priority 1 and stress level "C". Tom selects this one for the
          daily list with [F3] ("do").  The next item in the warehouse
          appears in the box.

          Using [F1] ("cycle") and [F3], Tom moves through the warehouse to
          select all of his daily list.  We won't show each one here;
          instead, as an exercise, choose each of the following:



               Fix presentation slides
               J.A. marketing presentation
               Work out Beta Industries lab plan
               Write activity summary


          This selection makes a total of seven to-dos in the daily list. 
          To verify the count, look at the summary in the screen to the
          right by pressing [Right-Arrow].  The summary shows one "C", four
          "B's" and two "A's".  This is a moderately heavy amount of work
          for a day with two meetings and Tom rolls up his sleeves to get
          at them.

          You will undoubtedly come up with your own philosophy about daily
          list selection.  Everyone has their won preferences, but we have
          one very important piece of advice: don't be too ambitious. 
          Over-ambition is being dishonest with yourself, and in the long
          run will discourage you from using TMPC.  If you face an
          impossible workload, face the situation squarely - don't pretend
          to be superhuman.

                          Lesson 1: Setting the Daily List

          As the final step to his daily selection, Tom moves back to the
          "process to-do" screen.  This is the first of several returns
          there today, as he completes the tasks he has assigned himself. 
          Now, however, he simply presses [F8] ("print") to make a hard
          copy of the list.  This step requires a printer.

          Finally, Tom exits TMPC by typing four up-arrows.  This concludes
          the first lesson.  As an exercise, we recommend that you move
          through the screens of TMPC on your own.  Don't enter any
          "dead-end" corridors, since doing so can change the task file. 
          Instead, move around the screens until you feel generally
          confident about "where you are" at any point.

                         Lesson 2: Maintaining the Warehouse

          In the last lesson, we showed how Tom begins each workday by
          selecting a daily list from a warehouse of to-dos.  In this
          lesson, we will examine the warehouse more closely.  As with any
          warehouse, the notion of "in" and "out" is very important, so
          keep it in mind during the lesson.


                                   The Inspiration

          Sporadically throughout the day, Tom will enter TMPC with an
          "inspiration", which is a sudden idea for a to-do.  These
          inspirations can result from reading magazine articles, getting
          phone call, or conversations with fellow employees.  When they
          occur, Tom likes to record inspirations quickly, then get on with
          his business.  In this way, he avoids daydreaming and remembers
          things later.

          As Tom is fixing the presentation slides, he suddenly realizes
          that a simulation program may give better results with a
          different kind of input.  He enters TMPC. (Do so yourself to
          follow along.)  Then, he presses [Left-Arrow].  The screen
          appears:



                                      Screen 1
                      ****************************************

                      *                                *edit**
                      ************************************* **
                      *                                    %

                      ************************************* **
                      *Unassigned********Unassigned******** **



          Then, he presses [Up-Arrow].  At this point, TMPC enters the TEXT
          program on the Model 100.  Tom knows how to use TEXT; if you
          don't, see page 19 of the Model 100 owner's manual.  Meanwhile,
          Tom enters in a quick description, such as "alternate simulations
          runs".  Then, he presses [F8] to exit TEXT.  He now sees the same
          screen as before, except with the new inspiration on it.  After a
          quick check of the text, he exits TMPC by pressing [Right-Arrow]
          [Up-Arrow].  You should get in the habit of recording your
          inspirations with TMPC.

                         Lesson 2: Maintaining the Warehouse



                                The Warehouse Cleanup

          The to-do warehouse, like any warehouse, becomes cluttered and
          disorganized unless it receives regular attention.  Tom spends
          some time each week attending to this organization.  He chooses
          some time when he is at his best - attentive and decisive.  It is
          hard work, since he must evaluate to-dos for stress and
          priority, and break up large to-dos into smaller ones.  These
          tasks require judgment.

          You may have noticed that the inspiration above had no stress or
          priority assigned to it.  Instead, both showed as "unassigned". 
          With a few exceptions, most inspirations go into the warehouse
          unassigned.  However, TMPC will not allow you to select them for
          the daily list until you assign both stress and priority.  It is
          a discipline; it forces you to learn what you do best and what
          your real priorities are.  If you're like most people, the
          results may surprise you.

          Some inspirations are for entire projects - much more than a few
          hour's work.  TMPC cannot prevent you from putting these large
          to-dos on your daily list, but it is a bad idea. You should try
          to break to-dos up into small enough units that 5-10 of them will
          fill a day.  If your vocation naturally involves large projects,
          break them down into smaller tasks.  Otherwise, you will quickly
          lose all interest in tracking your to-dos. It makes little more
          sense to put a two-week project on the daily list than to put the
          words, "do my job". You will not benefit from the monitoring, the
          reinforcement, or the archiving functions unless you break big
          projects down to size.  If it seems like useless work to do so,
          you should think carefully about your working habits.  If may be
          that this approach to to-dos is genuinely ill-suited to your
          job; if so, however, you are a rare exception.

          Thus, the three main tasks associated with a warehouse cleanup
          are prioritizing, assigning stress levels, and breaking up big
          projects into manageable tasks.  In addition, you may have second
          thoughts about a to-do in the warehouse and decide to discard it
          of defer it indefinitely.  We will follow Tom as he goes through
          this process in miniature.

          Enter TMPC and press [Down-Arrow].  You will see a summary of the
          to-dos in the warehouse:

          The number to watch is the number of "unassigned" to-dos, since
          these will be the focus of the warehouse cleanup.  (The number of
          priority 1 to-dos is interesting as well; if all your to-dos are
          priority 1, something is probably going haywire.)  After
          examining the count of unassigned to-dos, Tom moves into the
          warehouse by pressing [Left-Arrow].  The following screen
          appears:

          If you remember the list of the day's appointments and deadlines,
          you will notice the similar format.  You may also remember that
          the "p" box moves the list forward by one page.  Notice the
          headings for priorities and for unassigned items.

          The first item listed on the screen (shown in inverse video) is
          the "selected" item.  Press [Up-Arrow] to move between the "+"
          and the "-" boxes.  These boxes will move the selected item up
          and down in the list.  Tom selects the second item ("alternate
          simulation runs") by pressing [Right-Arrow], then presses
          [Up-Arrow] to move to the screen above the warehouse:

          This is the same screen you saw above in the "inspiration"
          section, except that the text-display area contains the selected
          to-do.  Tom has decided that this to-do is priority 2,
          stress-grade "A"; accordingly, he presses [Left-Arrow] to move
          over the priority box, presses [Down-Arrow] twice, presses
          [Left-Arrow] to move over the stress box, presses [Down-Arrow]
          once, then presses [Right-Arrow] twice.  When he returns to the
          warehouse by pressing [Down-Arrow], the to-do will be in its
          proper position, and the next to-do in the warehouse will be
          selected.  You can also change priorities and stress levels after
          you have assigned them - Tom finds he must often "upgrade" the
          priority of a to-do as it becomes more urgent that he finish it.

          Tom decides that "Drynan Results" is too large to be a single
          to-do.  So, he selects it (by pressing [Left-Arrow]) and moves
          back to the editing screen with [Up-Arrow].  Then, he moves into
          TEXT by pressing [Up-Arrow] again.  Once in the editor, he
          changes it to look as follows:

                         Lesson 2: Maintaining the Warehouse

          Notice that the ENTER key separates the three to-dos in the file. 
          Then, Tom presses [F8] to leave TEXT.  The screen looks as
          follows:



                                      Screen 1
                      ****************************************
                      *Get sales approval for Drynan - *******

                      * ***************** ***************** **
                      ************************************* **
                      *Unassigned********Unassigned******** **



          As always, the screen shows the last to-do in the group he
          added.  Tom assigns it priority 3, stress grade "C", and moves
          back to the warehouse.  By pressing [Left-Arrow], he selects the
          next previous to-do from the file he entered; he assigns it
          priority 2 and stress grade "B".  Similarly, he selects the first
          to-do in his expanded file and assigns it priority 2 and stress
          level "C".  A quick return to the screen to the right (press
          [Right-Arrow]) shows that there are no unassigned to-dos left in
          the warehouse; the cleanup is almost complete.

          As the final step, Tom cycles through every item in the warehouse
          in the selection screen.  (This is where we selected a daily list
          in the last lesson.  To get there, press [Down-Arrow]
          [Left-Arrow]).  Tom uses [F1] to examine each item; he decides
          that "JFFI Research memo" has been sitting too long, and there is
          no time to do it.  So, he deletes it with [F5].

          At this point, we have shown all of the basic techniques for
          using the warehouse.  To-dos enter the warehouse through
          "inspirations", and by breaking down large to-dos into smaller
          ones.  (you can also return to the warehouse from the daily
          list, as we showed in Lesson 1.)  To-dos move from the unassigned
          area to the assigned area when you give them priority and stress
          ratings.  They leave the warehouse by deletion, or by selection
          into the daily list.  We highly encourage you to think of your
          job in terms of tasks to be done, and to track them with TMPC.

                            Lesson 3: Time-Related Items

          In the last two lesson, we have shown how to use the warehouse
          and the daily list, both of which are independent of time.  In
          the next two lessons, we will discuss time-related items.

          To clarify Lessons Three and Four, we define some terms below. It
          will help you to remember that we use these terms precisely.

                                     Definitions

          Appointment.   Any entry in the calendar section with a time
                         associated with it.  The first character of the
                         description must begin with a digit.

          Memo.          Any entry in the calendar section without a time
                         associated with it.  The first character of the
                         description must not begin with a digit.

          Item.          Either an appointment or a memo.

          Current date.  The date that will flash if you enter the calendar
                         screen.

          Today.         The day set by DATE$ in BASIC when you enter TMPC. 
                         TMPC does not change DATE$, and of course, it
                         might not really be "today", as in our example.

          Calendar day ("Cday").   One day on the calendar.

          Business day ("Bday").   Mondays through Fridays, excluding
                                   business holidays.


          We will structure our examples around five different "events" in
          Tom's workday.  Each event shows a different feature of the
          time-related section of TMPC.


                                Adding an Appointment

          Tom gets a telephone call from one of the company salesman. 
          There will be a meeting with Drynan to review the results of the
          lab program.  "Just a minute", Tom replies.  He enters TMPC.

                            Lesson 3: Time Related Items

          Tom presses [Right-Arrow] to move to the calendar screen.  He
          presses [Right-Arrow] again to activate the cursor arrows for the
          calendar.  "When is the meeting?" he asks.  Finding out that it
          is on the 23rd at 2:30 Pm, he presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow]
          [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] to move over the date.  Then, he
          presses [Enter] to deactivate the cursor arrows.  He presses
          [Down-Arrow] to see appointments and deadlines for the 23rd.

          In the first lesson, this screen showed Tom's appointments for
          the 11th, or "today".  However, the screen actually shows
          appointments for the current date, and the current date is set to
          today whenever you enter TMPC or return to the first two corridor
          screens.  As an exercise, you may want to try it now.  Move to
          the screen to the left of the appointment list; then move back.
          You will see today's appointments, instead of those for the 23rd;
          then, move to the calendar.  The calendar will show today's date
          again, not the 23rd.  Move the date back to the 23rd as before
          and continue with our example.

          "The 23rd is fine with me", Tom says, seeing the dearth of
          activity for that afternoon.  He exchanges a few remarks about
          the Drynan lab results with the salesman.  While doing so, he
          presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to select the
          item right before the position of the meeting:

          TMPC does not automatically sort appointments by time; you must
          put them int he right order.  This gives you flexibility to enter
          the times in any format you want.  Tom presses [Down-Arrow] to
          edit the appointment immediately before the addition:

          After pressing [F8], he thinks it would be nice to have several
          days' warning of the upcoming meeting.  So, he presses
          [Right-Arrow] and [Down-Arrow] and enters the number "5" for the
          number of days warning.  After pressing [Enter], he presses
          [Right-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to make the warning for five business
          days:

          TMPC allows you to express warnings in terms of either Cdays or
          Bdays.  Five Bdays is usually a week, unless there are holidays
          involved.  To see the effect of the warning, move back to the
          calendar and set the date to January 16.  Check the appointments
          for that day, and you will see a deadline for the meeting,
          showing 5 Bdays left.

          Now that the meeting has been scheduled, Tom exits TMPC and
          continues with his business.

          Tom gets another call from a salesman.  "Synquil just called", he
          says. "They want to reschedule the meeting next Wednesday from 10
          to 2:30". Tom enters TMPC and moves directly to the appointment
          list by pressing [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow].  He selects the

          You will notice that the date changed from "today" to the date of
          the Synquil meeting.  This is what happens whenever you select a
          deadline and edit it: The date changes to the deadline date.  Tom
          realized this; he used it as a shortcut to move to next week.
          Before changing the time of the appointment, he presses
          [Up-Arrow] to see if there are any afternoon appointments.

          "Just fine", he says, since 2:30 is free.  He presses
          [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to enter TEXT and changes the "10 to
          "2 1/2".  He presses [F8], then presses [Up-Arrow] to see if the
          order is OK:

          Now you can see clearly that TMPC does not automatically sort
          appointments: a 2:30 meeting shows up before a lunch date.
          However, Tom quickly solves this problem with the "cut and paste"
          feature.  He presses [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to
          "cut" the meeting; note that a "p" now appears, and that the
          next item is selected:

          [Ed. Note: The example will work properly if you "cut" the 11:45
          meeting and "paste" it BEFORE the 2:30 meeting, instead of
          cutting the 2:30 meeting. (information from supplemental error
          sheet)]


          He then presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to select
          the J.A. meeting; then, he pastes in the Synquil meeting before
          it by pressing [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] [Left-Arrow].  The changes
          are now complete:

          The tutorial format makes these changes seem cumbersome, but with
          a little practice, you will be able to reschedule appointments
          with very little difficulty.


                            Adding Multiple Appointments

          Tom gets a call from his friend Mike.  They and several other
          friends have formed a syndication to buy a set of baseball season
          tickets.  "We know the dates of your games", he says.  Tom enters
          TMPC and presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to move
          into the "add appointment" screen.  He presses [Down-Arrow] and
          enters "Mets Game" in TEXT, then presses [F8].  He is entering
          the games as "memo" - that is, without any times - because the
          times vary, and are usually in the evening anyway.

          He presses [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] to move into the
          appointment list:

                            Lesson 3: Time Related Items

          Tom entered the baseball game for "today", for convenience.  He
          now cuts the memo from today by pressing [Right-Arrow].  "When is
          the first game?" he asks.  "June 14th", Mike answers, and begins
          a long list of dates, about 12 in all.  For each one, Tom follows
          the same procedure:


             # He selects the date in the calendar screen.

             # He moves to the day's appointment list.

             # He presses [Left-Arrow] to "paste the memo"


          You can use the cut and paste feature to duplicate appointments
          as well as rearrange them.  However, there is one important
          warning: if you move ANYWHERE besides the calendar or the
          appointment list screens, whatever you cut will be lost for good.
          You can use this feature to delete appointments, but take care,
          or you may delete on unintentionally.

          Once all the memos are added, Tom discusses with Mike the
          futility of attending Mets games and eventually returns to his
          work.


                              Adding a Business Holiday

          Tom's boss sticks his head into the office.  "If you want to go
          skiing this weekend, it's fine with me and Rick says OK, too", he
          says.  "just make sure that the presentations won't be affected".
          Tom had asked for Monday off so he could visit some friends in
          Vermont.

          "That won't be a problem", Tom says confidently as he enters
          TMPC.  He presses [Right-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] and sets the date
          to next Monday.  Then, he presses [ENTER] [Down-Arrow]
          [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to move into
          TEXT, enters "Vacation", presses [F8], then presses 
          [Right-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to set the warning to
          "Bday".

          Any item with a warning of "0 Bdays" is a business holiday.  You
          have already seen how TMPC skips weekends in figuring
          business-day deadlines; it will skip business holidays as well. 
          While Tom's boss is still there, he looks at today's appointment
          list again by pressing  [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow]
          [Up-Arrow] [Right-Arrow].  The detour to the status screen resets
          the current date to today.  Tom then presses [Right-Arrow] to
          move to the second pate, where the deadlines are.  There is
          nothing critical.  "Yep - no problem at all", he says.


                               Days Between Two Dates

          As Tom is working, an associate sticks his head in the office. 
          "Say Tom", he says with a leer, "you have that jiffy little
          computer - can you use it for me for a sec?"

          Tom isn't sure whether to be patronizing or contemptuous, but he
          says diplomatically, "sure", what do you want?"

          "We were talking about the Janbel contract, and we want to know
          how many days are left before November 30, when it's due", is the
          reply.  Without answering immediately, Tom enters TMPC and
          presses  [Right-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to set the current date. 
          He moves to November 30 by pressing [CTRL+Right-Arrow]
          [SHIFT+Left-Arrow] [SHIFT+Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow]
          [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow].  Then, he presses
          [ENTER], then  [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow]
          [Down-Arrow].  Once in TEXT, he puts a memo, "days before
          November 30", presses [F8], then puts a warning of "365 Bdays" on
          it.  The number 365 is large enough to make the warning visible
          for over a year before November 30.  Then, he moves back to
          today's appointment list using the detour in the example above. 
          He finds the memo, and announces to his associate the number of
          business days in the warning:

          Tom subtracts a day for his ski vacation, since this does not
          apply to the Janbel contract. "That's the number of business
          days", Tom adds dryly, "but maybe you'd better know the number of
          calendar days, too, since you'll probably be working every
          weekend until then."

          As a last step, Tom "cuts" the memo, then leaves TMPC.

          We can only encourage you to experiment with the calendar
          capabilities of TMPC.  You will discover many shortcuts and
          tricks by experimentation, many of which we intentionally built
          in.  Once you finish the lessons, the Reference Section is a good
          starting point for your experimentation.

                              Lesson 4: Repeating Items

          In the last lesson, we showed an example of a memo ("Mets Game")
          that repeated a dozen times during the summer.  Other
          appointments and memos will repeat more regularly.  Most of us
          simply try to remember these repeating events, such as reports
          due or church functions, but it is better to have them in the
          calendar.  TMPC provides a way that most repeating activities can
          be entered only once; this lesson shows how to use this feature.

          Throughout this lesson, we refer to only a few entries in TOM.DO. 
          There aren't any more examples involving Tom himself.  Enter TMPC
          with TOM.DO still in place, and follow along with the examples
          below.


                                 Example 1: Birthday

          A day which repeats every year is simple to enter with TMPC.  As
          an example, look at the entries for January 11.  The entry "EPG
          b'day" is a repeating entry.  Select it in the appointment-list
          screen and more to the add-appointment screen:

          There is a corridor off to the right of this screen that has been
          absent from all the previous items we examined.  The corridor
          leads to the repeating-item screen, where the exact details of
          the repeating item are stored.

          once; so, you could make the entry "EPG b'day" appear on the
          eleventh of any of the twelve months.  Of course, it makes little
          sense to have a birthday entry for more than once per year.


                             Example 2: Activity Report

          For another example, examine the "activity summary" entry.  (This
          entry is a deadline listed under January 11; move to the
          appointment-list screen and select it; then return to the
          repeating item screen).  The data for the activity summary are:



                                      Screen 14
                      **JanFebMarAprMayJunJlyAugSepOctNovDec**

                              Lesson 4: Repeating Items

          Here, every month is active, meaning that the activity summary is
          due on the 15th of every month.  There is also an indication
          "scan before", which has a special meaning. It means that if the
          15th of the month is not on a business day, the date for that
          month will fall on the last business day before the 15th.  By
          pressing [Down-Arrow], you can select "after" or "none".  With
          "before" selected, the activity summary comes due on Friday,
          January 13.


                              Example 3: J. A. Meeting

          Many repeating events do not fit the pattern of a day (or days)
          of each month.  TMPC offers one other type of repeating: by the
          week.  For an example, select "J.A. Meeting" from January 11 and
          move to the repeating-entry screen:



                                      Screen 13
                      **1**2**3**4**5**L**********************

          The format of the screen is similar, and the function is almost
          the same.  "Week" refers to week of the month. There is no
          business-holiday scanning available for this type of repeating
          entry.


          Making New Repeating Entries

          Every entry you create will start as a single entry.  To make it
          a repeating entry, you must move to the far right box in the
          add-appointment screen and press [Down-Arrow] until either
          "monthly" or "weekly" repeating appears.  Then, press
          [Right-Arrow] to enter the repeating-item screen and adjust it as
          you wish.

                               Lesson 5: File Handling

          TMPC deals with two different types of data files.  This lesson
          discusses these files and how you can manipulate them.  The
          lesson also covers the subject of multiple machine language
          files.


                                    The Task File

          The Task File contains all your to-dos, appointments, memos, and
          repeating items.  TOM.DO is a task file.  You can select the task
          file while in TMPC.  To do this, enter TMPC and press
          [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] [Down-Arrow]. 
          TMPC will prompt you, "Task File?"  Key in the name of the task
          file you want to use, and press [ENTER] (it isn't necessary to
          add ".DO").  If you type a nonexistent file name, TMPC will
          create an empty task file for you.

          TMPC will always initialize new task files to "today", or the
          value of DATE$.  Make sure that DATE$ is correct before creating
          a new task file.


                                   The Diary File

          The Diary file archives all of your past appointments and to-dos. 
          It is updated only when you enter TMPC and DATE$ has changed, or
          when you specify a new task file.  When you first enter TMPC with
          TOM.DO, TMPC creates a diary file from an imaginary January 10,
          1984.

          The Diary file is always called DIARY.DO.  If you just finished
          the other lessons in the tutorial, examine DIARY.DO and get
          familiar with its format. You can change it as you wish; TMPC
          never looks at old diary records to check their format.  The
          format is design to be easy to process, not to look pretty; this
          way, you can use a custom-made BASIC program (or whatever) to fit
          it exactly to your needs.  An example BASIC program comes on your
          tape, called DFORM.BA. It sends a "beautified" form of the diary
          to any output device (screen, line printer, etc.)










                                      Page: 27





                               Lesson 5: File Handling

          Once TMPC enters an appointment into DIARY.DO, it deletes it from
          the task file.  Normally, this is just what you would want  - but
          if you accidentally set DATE$ too far ahead, you can really
          damage your task file by deleting all of your dated items!  As a
          check against this, TMPC will ask you to verify the date if it is
          more than one day ahead of the last activation date.  To see and
          example, set DATE$ to "01/13/84" in BASIC and enter TMPC using
          TOM.DO.  You will see the question:


          Last Day 01/11/84
          Today is 01/13/84
          Proceed?


          If you answer "no", you will exit the program, presumably to fix
          DATE$.  There will be plenty of occasions where it is OK to
          answer "yes" (or just "y"), such as after a weekend.


                               Machine Language Files

          If TMPC is your only machine language file, you can skip this
          section.  You can continue indefinitely using TMPC.BA to run TMPC
          from the menu without any problems at all.  However, if you
          commonly use other machine language programs on the Model 100,
          this section will contain some useful information.

          Unless you know something about machine language programming, the
          problems of multiple machine language programs may seem arcane or
          ridiculous.  However, the problems are real, as so it the danger
          to your files.  If you are careless or hasty, you could lose
          every file on your Model 100.  The basic problem is this: a
          machine language program on the Model 100 must occupy exactly the
          same memory locations every time it runs.  Further, machine
          language programmers write different programs to occupy the same
          locations.

          The most convenient locations for machine language programs on
          the Model 100 is between HIMEM and MAXRAM.  With very few
          exceptions, every machine language program must be in that area
          to run correctly.  MAXRAM is fixed; you can set HIMEM with the
          BASIC CLEAR command.  If HIMEM is set about the "top" address of
          a machine language program, you cannot run it or even load it. 
          The memory between HIMEM and MAXRAM is called "reserved" memory;
          it is useless to BASIC programs or any files at all; and , of
          course, it can (in general) hole only one machine language
          program at a time.

                               Lesson 5: File Handling

          The cassette recorder is one way you can use more than one
          machine language program.  However it is just too slow to use
          every time you want to run TMPC (and probably many other
          programs).  The Model 100 also allows you to save machine
          language files into RAM files - which are different from reserved
          memory.  When you select a CO file from the menu, the Model 100
          copies its contents into reserved memory and runs the program
          there.  This solution is great if you have lots of memory.  You
          must have the memory reserved (with the CLEAR command) before you
          run the CO file, or the Model 100 just beeps and returns you to
          the menu.

          However, if you're like most Model 100 users, you count your
          bytes closely.  Many users have rejected machine language
          programs because they use memory "twice" - once in reserved
          memory, and once in the CO file.  Other users keep only one
          machine language program in reserved memory, and keep the others
          on cassette.  We recommend this course if you seldom use machine
          language programs other than TMPC.


                                FUTIL.BA Description

          However, TMPC comes with a BASIC program, FUTIL.BA, which allows
          you to load machine language programs into reserved memory
          without reserving the memory first.  If you're curious how it
          works, read the program; we won't explain it here.  But we will
          discuss how to use it.


             # Load FUTIL from the TMPC tape into BASIC (using CLOAD
               "FUTIL").

             # Determine the TOP, END, and EXE values for each of your
               machine language programs.  You can find these out by
               loading them from cassette (CLOADM always prints the values)
               or from the programs' user manuals.  You also must determine
               whether a CALL statement from BASIC can run the program
               correctly - normally, the answer is "Yes"

             # Type EDIT to change the FUTIL program; once in the program
               editor, type [CTRL-Z] to move to the bottom of the file.

             # Add one DATA statement for each of your machine language
               programs, following the format shown in the program file.

             # Use [F8] to exit the editor, and use SAVE "FUTIL" to save
               the program.  You may also want to save the changed program
               to cassette or disk.

                               Lesson 5: File Handling


          You are now ready to run FUTIL.  When you run it, it will prompt
          you: 


          (L)oad or (S)ave?


          If there is no reserved memory, you can only Load; you won't see
          this prompt.  Load moves a CO file into reserved memory, which
          will cause you to lose whatever was in reserved memory.  Save
          creates a CO file from reserved memory and also "unreserves" it,
          leaving it clear for your BASIC programs or files.

          After you type "L" or "S", FUTIL will prompt you "file name?" 
          You must answer with one of the files in DATA statements below. 
          After that, it will either do the load or save, or complain that
          something is wrong - for example, no DATA statement, no CO file,
          not enough memory, etc.  These messages are all pretty much
          self-explanatory.

          Some machine language programs will not work with FUTIL. 
          Anything that changes the BASIC expansion latches (e.g., Pro Aid
          or Supera by Micro Demon, or Radio Shack's bar code software)
          should be handled very carefully.  Any program which requires
          HIMEM to be lower than TOP to run (which is foolish and probably
          rare) will not work.

          All these warnings should make you careful.  We do not want you
          to lose any data; we wish the Model 100 had limitless memory, but
          it doesn't.

          To review, we will present an example.  Suppose that Tom has a
          word-processing program WORDCOMET- which is written in machine
          language.  When Tom first bought TMPC, he loaded FUTIL.BA from
          tape, then loaded WRDCMT off cassette (with CLOADM).  He got the
          following printout:


          Found: WRDCMT
          TOP: 60161
          END: 62915
          EXE: 60535


          Tom edited FUTIL to show the appropriate data statements for
          WORDCOMET-.  He adds the line:


          1010 DATA "WRDCMT",60161,62915,60535,"Y"

                                      Page: 30





                               Lesson 5: File Handling



          Then, he ran FUTIL.  Since he just loaded WORDCOMET- from
          cassette, he responds "S" to the prompt, then "WRDCMT" to the
          "filename" prompt.

          Then, Tom loaded TMPC and began using it.  When time comes to
          format some text with WRDCMT, he takes the following steps:


             # He runs FUTIL and responds "S"to the prompt, then enters
               "TMPC".

             # At the next FUTIL prompt, "file to load", he enters
               "WRDCMT".  When asked, "Execute?" he enters "y" to run it.

             # WORDCOMET- returns Tom to the Menu after it runs.  Although
               TMPC.BA is still there, Tom knows that it will not work; he
               first must return TMPC to reserved memory.  So, he (S)aves
               WRDCMT and loads TMPC.  Since he doesn't need TMPC right
               now, he responds "n" to the "Execute?" prompt.


          We hope we haven't confused you with this last section.  It can
          be confusing at first, so don't be frustrated.  Follow the
          instructions carefully, and if you get stuck, consult a friend
          who knows something about machine language programming.  They
          will be able to make better sense out of this section.

                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          The Procedure Reference Section summarizes how you can do most
          common tasks for which TMPC is useful.  For example: when you
          want to quickly add a task "to be done" to your list, how do you
          proceed" What if an appointment must be rescheduled?  This
          section answers these and other similar questions.

          Since this section answers practical questions directly, it is
          probably the first reference section to read.  However, the
          concise descriptions assume at least some familiarity with the
          Data Elements and the Screens, which are described in separate
          sections of the manual.  This difficulty is common in reference
          manuals: in a sense, you must read everything at once.  Don't be
          afraid to flip around in the reference section; if you get
          confused, read on patiently, and experiment with your TMPC
          program to clear up any ambiguity.

          We highly recommend reading the tutorial before reading the
          reference sections, especially the first lesson.  Even if you are
          a computer whiz, there may well be some new concepts for you in
          TMPC.

          To help you locate particular procedure descriptions below, this
          section proceeds in an outline.


                                  To-Do Procedures

          The to-do procedures described here all relate to the data
          element called the "to-do", as described in the "Data Elements"
          section.


          Adding a To-Do

          To add a new to-do to the warehouse, move to screen 1.  If you
          enter from screen 2 (Today's Date), the text-display area will
          always be blank; if you enter from screen 4 (View To-Do), the
          text-display area will contain the selected to-do from screen 4. 
          In either case, to add a to-do, press [Up-Arrow] into the "edit"
          block.









                                      Page: 32





                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          When you enter the "edit" block, TMPC moves into the Model 100's
          TEXT program.  (If there was text in the text-display area of
          screen 1, it will appear in the TEXT program as well.)  At this
          point, type in a description of the to-do using the TEXT program
          features (see page 43 of the Model 100 manual).  Exit the TEXT
          program when you are finished by pressing [F8], and TMPC will
          return to screen 1.

          NOTE: If there is already a to-do in the text-display area when
          you enter the "edit" block, do not delete the text that appears
          there, unless you want to delete that to-do.  Instead, put the
          description for the new to-do after the existing one, separated
          with the [ENTER] key.  Similarly, you can enter more than one
          to-do at once by separating each one with the [ENTER] key.


          Editing and Deleting a To-Do

          To edit the description of a to-do, select it on screen 4 (View
          To-Do), then move directly to screen 1.  The description will
          appear in the text-display area.  Then, press [Up-Arrow] to move
          into the "edit" block.

          When you move into the "edit" block, TMPC will activate the Model
          100's TEXT program; the to-do description from the text-display
          area will be the active file.  You can then change the text as
          you wish; the to-do will be updated when you exit TEXT using
          [F8].

          If you exit the TEXT program after deleting all of the text, the
          to-do entry will be deleted.  You can also subdivide a to-do into
          several to-dos by separating each division with the [ENTER] key;
          each newly created to-do will have the same priority and stress
          ratings as the original.

          A to-do can also be deleted in screen 7 - see "Selecting daily
          to-dos" below.


          Ranking a To-Do

          To change the priority or stress rating of a to-do, select it on
          screen 4 (View To-Do), then move directly to screen 1.  The
          description will appear in the text-display area, and the
          priority and stress levels will appear under their respective
          blocks.  Then, press [Left-Arrow] to move over the "Priority"
          block, or [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] to move over the "Stress"
          block.  Press [Down-Arrow] over the desired block to change the
          priority rating or the stress rating.  The changes will be saved
          when leaving screen 1.

                          Reference Section One: Procedures


          If a to-do is in the "unassigned" section of screen 4 (View
          To-Do), it will move to a different part of the list once you
          assign it both priority and stress.  Then, when you move back to
          screen 4 from screen 1, you will find that the selected item is
          now the next unassigned to-do in the list.  This feature allows
          you to move through the unassigned to-dos, assigning priority and
          stress to each one in succession (see the Tutorial, lesson 2, for
          an example).


          Selecting Daily To-Dos

          to select items from the warehouse for the daily list, first move
          to screen 8 (daily status) and check for items left over from
          earlier selections.  You may wish to process these individually
          (with screen 11), return all of them to the warehouse for
          re-selection, or simply leave them in the daily list.

          Then, move to screen 7 (Select to-do).  The text-display area
          will contain the description of one of a to-do from the
          warehouse; if there is no text, then there are no to-dos you can
          select.  You cannot select unassigned to-dos.

          There are three things you can do with the displayed to-do:


             # "Cycle" past it with [F1], which moves to the next to-do in
               the warehouse.

             # "Do" it, or select it for the daily list, with [F3].

             # "Cancel" it, or delete it from the warehouse list entirely,
               with [F5]


          Continue working through the warehouse list until your daily list
          contains a reasonable number of to-dos.  Consult the summary on
          screen 8 (daily status) as often as you need.


          Processing Daily To-Dos

          At various times during your day, you should process the daily
          list of to-dos.  Move to screen 11 (process to-do).  The
          text-display area will contain the description of the first to-do
          on the daily list; if there is no text, there are no daily to-dos
          on the list.  You can do one of four things with the daily to-do:

                          Reference Section One: Procedures

             # "Cycle" past it, with [F1].  This simply moves to the next
               daily to-do in the list.

             # Indicate it "done", with [F3].  The to-do is removed from
               the daily list and entered into the diary as completed.

             # "Cancel" it, with [F5].  The to-do is removed from the daily
               list and entered into the diary as canceled.

             # "Delay" it, with [F7].  The to-do is returned to the
               warehouse; no record is put into the diary.


          You can return every to-do in the daily list to the warehouse
          with a single keystroke by entering the "reset" block in screen 7
          (select to-do).  This block is the exact equivalent of pressing
          [F7] for every individual to-do in screen 11.


                               Date Related Procedures

          The date-related procedures described here all regard determining
          how busy a particular date is.  For example, how many
          appointments are there?  When is the next appointment scheduled? 
          Procedures for adding, modifying, and deleting appointments and
          memos are in the next section.


          Is Today a Holiday?

          If the date indicated by DATE$ in BASIC (called "today" for
          short) is listed as a business holiday in the task file, the name
          of the holiday will appear on the second line in screen 2
          (today's date).  The Julian date and the weekday are also
          indicated there.


          Selecting a Date for Inspection

          Screen 3 (appointment calendar) holds the capability to examine
          dates other than today.  Consult the screen reference section for
          complete details.

          Viewing Appointments for a Date

          Screen 6 (view appointments) will display the appointments,
          memos, and deadlines for a given date.  If you enter screen 6
          from screen 3 or screen 9, the date shown will be the last
          selected date; if you enter from screen 5, today's appointments
          will always be shown.  See the screen reference section for more
          detail on how to view the appointments.


                               Appointment Procedures

          The appointment procedures shown here serve to manipulate
          appointments and memos, as described in the Data Elements
          Reference section.  For brevity, both appointments and memos will
          be referred to as "items"


          Adding an Item

          First, select the date in screen 3 (appointment calendar).  Then,
          move to screen 6 (view appointments).  Check for conflicts.  If
          there are no items scheduled for that date, proceed to screen 9
          (add appointment).  Otherwise, select the item in the list that
          is above where you want the new item inserted.  Then move to
          screen 9.

          Note: The item list has three separate sections: appointments,
          memos, and deadlines.  If one of these is empty, and you want to
          add the first item - for example, there are no memos on the list
          and you want to add a memo - it does not matter which item you
          have selected.

          The text-display area in screen 9 will contain the description of
          the item you selected. (If there are no items, there will be no
          text.)  Press [Down-Arrow] to enter the "edit" block.  TMPC will
          activate the Model 100's TEXT program.  Enter the new item below
          the existing one, separating it with the [ENTER] key.  Do not
          delete the existing text, unless you want to delete the item it
          represents.  When you are done, press [F8], and TMPC will return
          you to screen 9.

          When screen 9 reappears, the text-display section will contain
          the new description you are entering.  As the final step to
          entering the new item, adjust the warning period, warning type,
          and repeat status as necessary - see the descriptions below for
          more detailed information.


                                      Page: 36





                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          There is one exception to this procedure: if you want to enter an
          item at the very beginning of its section.  For example, suppose
          that the first appointment you had listed for a date was 10:00
          am, and you wanted to add an 8:30 am appointment.  To accomplish
          the addition proceed as above until you are directly above the
          edit block in screen 9.  Then, press [Left-Arrow] [Right-Arrow];
          you will be in screen 9 with no description showing.  Enter TEXT
          and add the item, then modify it if necessary, as described
          above.  It will appear at the top of its section in screen 6.  An
          alternate way of putting an item at the very beginning of its
          section is to use "cut" and "paste", as demonstrated in Lesson 3
          of the tutorial.


          Deleting or Modifying an Item

          Before you can delete or modify an item, you must locate it.  Use
          screen 3 (appointment calendar) to select the date, and use
          screen 6 (view appointments) to select the item.  Then, move to
          screen 9.

          To delete the item or modify the description, use [Down-Arrow] to
          move into the "edit" box, and TMPC will activate the Model 100's
          TEXT program, with the description as the active file.  Make the
          changes you want; use [F8] to exit the TEXT program when done. 
          If you delete all of the text, TMPC will delete the item.

          An alternative way to delete an item (except a repeating item) is
          to select it in screen 6 and press [Right-Arrow] to move into the
          "cut" box.  If you then exit to screens 9 or 5, the item will be
          deleted.


          Rescheduling an Item

          This discussion does not apply to repeating items.  For full
          treatment of repeating items, refer to the Data Element Reference
          section.

          To reschedule an item, select it in screen 6 (view appointments),
          then press [Right-Arrow] to move into the "cut" box.  The item
          will disappear from the item list; the "paste" box will also
          appear, indicating that the item can be inserted again elsewhere. 
          You can use screen 3 (appointment calendar) to move to another
          date, if desired.  In screen 6, select the item after where you
          want the rescheduled item to appear; use [Left-Arrow] to move
          into the "paste" box.  The item will appear before the selected
          item.  If you try to paste an item into a different section, it
          will not go in where you have selected, but at the top of its
          proper section.

          Assigning a Warning

          You can put a warning on any item.  The warning will cause the
          item to appear as a deadline in the days leading up to the item. 
          To assign a warning, select the item in screen 6 (view
          appointments), then move directly to screen 9.  Press
          [Right-Arrow] to move over the "warning" box; press [Down-Arrow]
          to move into the box.  A cursor will flash in the three-space
          bar; type in the number of days warning.  (If you make an error,
          you can continually retype the number - only when you press
          [ENTER] is the number accepted.)  After you press [ENTER], press
          [Right-Arrow] to move over the "warning type" box.  If necessary,
          adjust the warning type by pressing [Down-Arrow].  The two
          possible values are as follows:


             # "Bday" means business days, and expresses the deadline in
               weekdays, excluding holidays.

             # "Cday" means calendar days, which counts every day as part
               of the deadline.


          In addition to showing deadlines, you can use the warning feature
          to determine the number of business or calendar days between two
          dates.  Simply set a large warning value on a test memo (for
          example, "days remaining before 7/18"), move to the earlier date,
          and examine the "deadline" portion of the item list.  However,
          long deadlines slow down TMPC, so we don't recommend leaving
          these test memos permanently.


          Indicating a Holiday

          A holiday is nothing more than a memo with a warning of "0
          Bdays".  Use the procedures above to enter the memo; the text of
          the memo should be the name of the holiday.


          Repeating Entry Items

          Refer to screen 14 reference in the Screen Reference Section for
          more information about how to manipulate repeating entry items.

                                 General Procedures

          The procedures in this section deal with miscellaneous
          activities, all related to RAM files on the Model 100.


          Adding a Remark to the Diary

          The diary is a record file.  TMPC adds to the diary only when
          "starting up" (when you first enter the program), and then only
          if there is a new date.  For example, if you enter TMPC on March
          16, and the last time you entered it was on March 15, the diary
          will be updated.

          The diary will contain three major types of entries:


             # The single-entry (not repeating) appointments and memos from
               all days prior to today.  These items are removed from the
               task file once added to the diary.

             # The repeating appointments and memos which have had entries
               in the days prior to today.  Repeating entries are not
               deleted when entered into the diary.

             # All to-dos processed as "done" or "canceled" in the last
               session.  These are deleted from the task file and listed in
               the diary under the date when TMPC was last activated.


          The diary file always has the name, DIARY.DO.  New entries will
          be made on the end of this file, regardless of what the rest of
          it contains - so, take care not to mix entries from several task
          files together.  However, once the entries have been made, you
          can examine them as you would any other document file, and make
          changes as you see fit.

          Because the diary is a text file, it is simple to add remarks to
          it - simply use the TEXT program.










                                      Page: 39





                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          However, if you want to add a remark to today's diary entry today
          (as opposed to tomorrow until TMPC makes the entry tomorrow), the
          best way is to add a memo into today's item list.  If you enter
          screen 9 (add appointment) from screen 8 (daily status), you will
          always see a blank text-display area.  Press [Down-Arrow] to
          enter the "edit" block, and use the TEXT program to add the
          remark.  Once you are finished, exit the TEXT program with [F8],
          and the remark will be put on today's item list - and will
          eventually wind up in the diary.


          Turning off the Diary

          For various reasons, you may not be interested in a diary file. 
          You can suppress any additions to the diary file by moving to
          screen 10, and pressing [Down-Arrow] to move into the "diary"
          block.  This block will toggle the diary on and off.  Turning the
          diary off does not delete the diary file; it only prevents
          further entries.


          Changing the Task File

          The task file contains all of the to-dos, memos, and
          appointments, and also stores the last activation date.  So,
          using two different task files is like maintaining two separate
          date books - both completely independent of each other.  You may
          be interested in doing this if you have many appointments at
          work and many more in some outside activity.

          Task files are always document files.  You can use TELCOM to
          transmit and receive task files, and you can save them to
          cassette tape using TEXT.  However, never change a task file with
          TEXT unless you know what you're doing.  A technical description
          of the task-file format appears in part 1 of the Technical
          Reference Section.

          To change the task file while in TMPC, move to screen 10 and
          press [Down-Arrow] to move into the "Task File" block.  The
          screen will clear, and TMPC will prompt, "Task File?"  Respond
          with the new name; the ".DO" extension is not necessary.  If you
          type a nonexistent file name, TMPC will create a new task file. 
          If you type an existing task file's name, TMPC will update the
          diary (which is always called DIARY.DO), if necessary, from the
          new task file.  You can mix entries in the diary if you aren't
          careful.  Be certain that you either turn the diary off, or that
          you've renamed the diary file (use the BASIC NAME command) before
          activating another task file.

                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          The task file has some precise internal formats.  If these
          formats get changed by program error or by your tampering, the
          message, "Task File Contains Internal Errors" will appear, and
          TMPC will abruptly return you to the main menu.  When re-entering
          TMPC, you must then specify another task file, or fix the
          corrupted one first.

                        Reference Section Two: Data Elements

          The data-element reference section describes each of the four
          major data types that TMPC manipulates: the to-do, the fixed-date
          item, the weekly-repeating item, and the monthly-repeating item.


                                      The To-Do

          The purpose of the to-do it to record a task to be done, or a
          task "to do", whence its name.  Screens that manipulate to-dos
          are screens 1, 4, 7, and 11; screens 5 and 8 report information
          about to-dos.

          A specific flow of information is associated with a to-do.  When
          inspiration or circumstance first originates the idea of doing
          some task, you enter a description of a new to-do on screen 1. 
          It then waits in the "warehouse", a storage area, until you rank
          it (see below).  Eventually, you select it as something to be
          done today, and move it to a daily list; at this point, it
          becomes a constant reminder to you until you complete the task,
          cancel it, or return it to the warehouse.  Its final form is a
          note in the diary.  This process may take place in a short time
          (as with a task which quickly arises and is simply done), or it
          may extend for weeks or even months (as with a low-priority
          project resulting from a midnight inspiration).


          Attributes

          The to-do has three attributes: a description, a priority, and a
          stress rating.  The description must consist of 63 characters or
          less, and cannot include characters with ASCII codes less than 32
          ("control" characters).  The priority classifies the urgency of
          the task into three categories; you are free to attribute
          whatever meanings you want to them.  The stress grade classifies
          the difficulty of doing the task; again, you determine the exact
          meanings.  You must assign both a priority and a stress grade to
          a to-do (called "ranking" the to-do) before you can select it for
          the daily list.

                                 The Fixed-Date Item

          Unlike the to-do, which has no specific date associated with it,
          the fixed-date item resembles an entry in a date book.  The word
          "item" refers to two things at once: an appointment, which has a
          specific time associated with it, and a memo, which is a reminder
          associated with a date.

          There is little difference between appointments and memos.  TMPC
          makes no attempt to sort appointments by the time of day; you
          must keep them in order as you enter them (see the section
          Entering an Item, in the Procedure Reference Section above).  The
          only distinction between appointments and memos is that an
          appointment's description begins with a digit (0-9), while a memo
          begins with some other character.  This means that you should not
          begin a memo description with a number.  Appointments and memos
          each appear in their own section of the item list in screen 6.

          A fixed-date item has a particular time sequence associated with
          it.  At some point, you enter it using screen 9.  From then on,
          it is present as a reminder in either the appointments or memos
          section of the daily list - they will appear whenever you select
          the date when they entered.  For example: today is March 9. You
          enter an appointment for March 17.  It will appear as a reminder
          whenever you examine the item list  for March 17.  Then, once the
          date of the item is past, TMPC removes it from  the item list and
          puts it into the diary (if the diary is disable, TMPC merely
          deletes the entry).  Consequently, after an appointment date is
          past, there is no record of it in the item list.


          Attributes

          The only real attribute that an item can have is a warning, which
          creates deadline entries in the days preceding the date of the
          item.  For instance, if you must submit a paper on September 19,
          1985, and you want a reminder of its impending deadline, you can
          enter a memo on September 19, 1985 entitled "paper due" and give
          this memo a warning of, say, 10 days.  Then, each of the 10 days
          preceding September 19, 1985 will show the days left until "paper
          due".

                        Reference Section Two: Data Elements

          You have the further option of specifying a warning in terms of
          business days ("bdays") or calendar days ("cdays").  A business
          day is a weekday, excluding holidays.  In the above example, if
          the warning were type "C" (cdays), the deadlines would begin in
          the September 9, 1985 item list.  If the warning were type "B"
          (bdays), the deadlines would begin in the September 5, 1985 item
          list.

          There is a special case of a warning.  If an item has a warning
          type of "B" and no warning period (i.e., 0 days), the item is
          taken as a business holiday.  So, to enter Christmas as a
          business holiday, put a memo on December 25, give it a warning
          type "B" and leave the warning period at 0.  The table below
          summarizes the types of warnings:



               Type           No. Days = 0   No. Days = n
               Cdays          No Warning     Deadlines begin n calendar
                                             days before item.

               Bdays          Business       Deadlines begin n business
                              Holiday        days before item.


          The Procedure Reference Section contains detailed information
          about entering, editing, and removing single-entry items.


                               Weekly Repeating Items

          weekly repeating items allow you to make one entry for repetitive
          items in your schedule, provided they are scheduled by weeks in
          every month.  For example: you go to a Bible class every Thursday
          evening; a civic club meets every third Tuesday for lunch;
          newspaper recycling pickups are on Tuesday and Thursday in the
          last week of every month.

          Weekly-repeating items are very much like single-date items. You
          enter them the same way; they can be memos or appointments; they
          can have warnings; and they are listed in the diary for each date
          when they appear.  however, there are three very important
          differences:


             # After you enter an item, you must specifically activate
               screen 13 and set the repeating parameters for it to be a
               weekly-repeating item.

                        Reference Section Two: Data Elements

             # You cannot "cut" or "paste" weekly-repeating appointments
               using the item list "c" and "p" boxes.  See screen 6 in the
               Screen Reference section for more details.

             # TMPC will never automatically remove a weekly-repeating
               item.  After each date passes with an entry, TMPC will add a
               note of it to the diary, but it will not remove the item.


          Weekly-repeating items always appear below the single-date items
          in the item list, regardless of when and where you enter them. 
          This is a software limitation, and it means that you will not
          always be able to show your appointments in order through the
          day.

          For more information about how to set the date for a
          weekly-repeating item, see screen 13 in the Screen Reference
          section.


                               Monthly Repeating Items

          A monthly-repeating item is very similar to a weekly repeating
          item.  There are only two major differences:


             # A monthly-repeating item allows you to set item dates by
               days of the month.  For example: your birthday, which comes
               once per year, and your paycheck, if it comes on the 15th
               and the last day of every month.  You must activate screen
               14 to set monthly-repeating dates, as opposed to screen 13
               for weekly repeating dates.

             # TMPC list monthly-repeating items after single-date items
               and weekly-repeating items in the item list.


          In every other way, monthly-repeating items are the same as
          weekly-repeating items.

                          Reference Section Three: Screens

          The screen reference section describes each of TMPC's fourteen
          screens: what they do and what they show.  It lists each screen
          in numerical order, and each in a similar format.  The screen
          numbers are arbitrary; the arrangement is as follows:

          This screen displays the three major attributes of a to-do: the
          description in a text-display area, the stress at the lower left,
          and the priority at the lower right.

          If you enter the screen from screen 2, there will never be a
          to-do displayed.  Instead, the text-display area will be empty,
          and both the stress grade and the priority will be unassigned. 
          If you enter this screen from screen 4, the to-do that was
          selected in screen 4 will be displayed in screen 1.


                                      Functions

             # Change Priority.  From indicated stick-figure position,
               press [Left-Arrow].  After this, pressing [Down-Arrow] will
               change priorities; they will cycle from "unassigned" to
               "priority 1" to "priority 2" to "priority 3".

               file will contain the text found in the text-description
               area.  Change the text as you wish.  Deleting all of the
               text will eliminate the to-do from the warehouse.  Adding
               new text, separated from any existing text with [ENTER],
               will create new to-dos.  Changing the existing text will
               update the description of the existing to-do.


                                        Exits

          To exit from the screen, press [Right-Arrow] to move to screen 2,
          or [Down-Arrow] to move to screen 4.  Exiting the screen saves
          any changes made to the to-do.  If a new priority or stress grade
          changes a to-do's position in the warehouse, screen 4 will
          select the to-do after the old position.

          This screen shows three pieces of information.  First, it shows
          today's date (the value that DATE$ returns in BASIC) and the
          weekday.  Second, if today is a business holiday, it shows the
          name of the holiday.  Finally, it shows the day number in the
          year (sometimes called the "Julian date"), and how many days are
          remaining in the year.  All of this information appears in the
          upper left corner of the screen.

                                Information Presented

          This screen displays three one-month calendars.  The central
          calendar always holds the current date, which is the date that
          you examine for appointments and deadlines.  Note that the
          current date differs from "today", which can only be changed in
          BASIC.  Whenever you enter screens 2 or 5, you reset the current
          date to today.

          Some of the dates on the three calendars are highlighted in
          inverse video.  You can select which of three criteria TMPC will
          use to highlight dates:


             # Dates that are business holidays (besides Saturdays and
               Sundays),

             # Dates with appointments, or

             # Dates with appointments or memos.


          Note that, if you have TMPC highlight dates with appointments, it
          will highlight business holidays as well.

          The current date (which always appears in the center calendar)
          flashes.  If the current date would be highlighted, it flashes
          faster than if it would not be.

          There are two basic functions in the appointment calendar screen. 
          The first is to select which dates are highlighted.  Pressing
          [Up-Arrow] will cause the highlighting to cycle between "none"
          (no highlighting), "appt" (appointments), and "ent" (any entry
          except deadlines).

          The second function of the appointment calendar is to select the
          current date.  To change the current date, press [Right-Arrow].
          the stick-figure will move into the dead end block to the right
          and the following cursor keys will become active:


          [Left-Arrow]             Move backward one day.
          [Right-Arrow]            Move forward one day.
          [Up-Arrow]               Move backward one week.
          [Down-Arrow]             Move forward one week.
          [Shift] [Left-Arrow]     Move backward one month.
          [Shift] [Right-Arrow]    Move forward one month.
          [Shift] [Up-Arrow]       Move to next previous highlighted date.
          [Shift] [Down-Arrow]     Move to next highlighted date.
          [CTRL] [Left-Arrow]      Move back one year
          [CTRL] [Right-Arrow]     Move forward one year.
          [CTRL] [Up-Arrow]        Move to today.
          [CTRL] [Down-Arrow]      Move to last date with a single-date
                                   item (repeating items go forever).


          To return the cursor keys to their normal function, press [ENTER]


                                        Exits

          There are two exits from screen 3.  Pressing [Left-Arrow] moves
          to screen 2, which also resets the current date to today. 
          Pressing [Down-Arrow] moves to screen 6, which displays a list
          of the appointments, memos, and deadlines for the current date.

          This screen shows the to-dos in the warehouse.  If there are more
          than will fit on the screen, the screen shows a portion of them,
          and the numbers above and below the arrows indicate how many are
          above and below the displayed portion, respectively.  The to-dos
          are grouped by priority; the unassigned to-dos appear in their
          own section at the top of the list.  Within each section, the
          to-dos appear in reverse order of stress: grade C stress first,
          then grade B stress, then grade A stress.

          On to-do always appears in reverse video.  It is the selected
          to-do.  This is the to-do that you would modify if you moved to
          screen 1, or the one where selection starts in screen 7.


                                      Functions

          There are two basic function of this screen: viewing to-dos in
          the warehouse and selecting them for manipulation.  The three
          boxes ("+", "-", and "p") all move the selected to-do and display
          a different portion of the warehouse.  Moving into the "+" box
          with [Right-Arrow] move the selected to-do down one in the list;
          moving into the "-" box with [Left-Arrow] moves the selected
          to-do up one in the list.  The "p" box moves the list forward by
          one page.

                                Information Presented

          This screen displays the items for the current date.  The list
          has the following structure:


            1. If there are any appointments, there is a header line above
               them.

            2. The appointments, if any, for the date.  The order is the
               order in which you enter them, except that all
               weekly-repeating appointments will be after all single-date
               appointments, and all monthly-repeating appointments will be
               after all weekly-repeating appointments.

            3. If there are any memos, there is a header line above them.

            4. The memos, if any, for the date.  The order is the order in
               which you enter them, except that all weekly-repeating memos
               will be after all single-date memos, and all
               monthly-repeating memos will be after all weekly-repeating
               memos.

            5. If there are any deadlines active for the current date,
               there will be a header line above them.

            6. The deadlines will be listed in time order, with the
               earliest deadlines first.  However, this order is based on
               the calendar time, not the number of business days.  Each
               deadline appears with its number of "bdays" (business days)
               or "cdays" (calendar days) left before the deadline.

                                      Functions

          There are four basic functions of this screen.  The first two are
          viewing items for the current date and selecting them for
          manipulation.  Three boxes ("+", "-", and "p") all move the
          selected item and display a different portion of the item list. 
          Moving into the "+" box with the [Right-Arrow] moves the selected
          item down one in the list; moving into the "-" box with the
          [Left-Arrow] moves the selected item up one in the list.  The "p"
          box moves the list forward by one page.

          The other two functions of the screen are cutting and pasting. 
          These functions allow you to delete, copy, and rearrange
          single-date items without using screen 9.  To "cut" (remove from
          the list and put into a buffer) a single-date item from the list,
          select it, then move into the "c" box with the [Right-Arrow]. 
          The selected item will disappear, and the "p" box will appear,
          indicating that there is something in the buffer.  Moving to any
          screen except screen 3, or "cutting" again, will clear the
          buffer.  To "paste" (deposit the buffer), select the item before
          which you want the buffer to go, and enter the "p" box with
          [Right-Arrow].  You may change the selected date (with screen 3)
          before pasting.


                                        Exits

          There are three exits from screen 6.  Pressing [Up-Arrow] moves
          to screen 3, which allows you to change the current date. 
          Pressing [Down-Arrow] moves to screen 9, which allows you to
          change the item selected in the list.  Pressing [Left-Arrow]
          moves to screen 5, which resets the current date to today and
          clears the "paste" buffer.

                                Information Presented

          This screen shows one of the to-dos from the warehouse at a time
          (unassigned to-dos are excluded).  Along with the description,
          the screen shows the priority and the stress grade.


                                      Functions

          There are four functions available on screen 7:


             # Cycle [F1].  Move on to the next item in the warehouse.

             # Do [F3].  Move the displayed to-do to the daily list and
               display the next to-do in the warehouse.

             # Delete [F5].  Remove the displayed to-do from the warehouse.

             # Reset.  Press [Down-Arrow] to move all items in the daily
               list back to the warehouse.


          If at any time the warehouse becomes empty, the text-display area
          will become blank; after that, the function keys do nothing. 
          Remember, "empty" here excludes unassigned to-dos.

                                Information Presented

          This screen displays the selected item from screen 6, along with
          its major attribute - the warning and the warning type.  If the
          item is a repeating-date item, the lower right corner of the
          screen will indicate which type.  If you enter screen 9 from
          screen 8, there will be no item indicated on the text-display
          area.


                                      Functions

          There are four major functions of this screen:


             # You can use the Model 100's TEXT program to insert new
               items, modify the existing item, or delete the existing
               item.  Press [Down-Arrow] to move into the "text" block, and
               TMPC will activate the TEXT program.  You can edit the
               existing text (if any); you can add new items by separating
               them with the [ENTER] key; you can delete the existing item. 
               When done, press [F8] to return to the screen.

             # You can change the warning period by pressing [Down-Arrow]
               to enter the "warning" box.  A cursor will flash in the
               small box; type in the new number.  When done, press
               [ENTER], and the stick-figure will move out of the box.  If
               you type in an illegal number (not 0 - 999), TMPC will beep
               and the warning will be set to 0.

             # You can change the type of warning from "c" to "b".  Press
               [Down-Arrow] into the "warning type" box to alternate
               between the type of warning.

             # You can make the entry a fixed-date item, a weekly-repeating
               item or a monthly-repeating item.  Press [Down-Arrow] into
               the box over the type of the item to change them.


                                        Exits

          Two exits are always available from this screen.  Pressing
          [Up-Arrow] moves to screen 6, where you can view the current
          date's items and select another for manipulation.  Pressing
          [Left-Arrow] moves to screen 8, which resets the current date to
          today and displays the number of to-dos in the daily list.

          If the item is a repeating item, there will be an exit on the
          right side of the screen.  Press [Right-Arrow] to move to screen
          13 (for weekly repeating items) or screen 14 (for monthly
          repeating items).

                                Information Presented

          This screens shows the movement factor for the stick-figure, the
          destination device (LCD or LPT) for a task-file listing, whether
          the diary feature is active or inactive, and the name of the
          current task file.


                                      Functions

          This screen performs four loosely related tasks:


             # Change the stick-figure character.  Pressing [Down-Arrow]
               over the leftmost block will cycle between "walk", "run",
               and "fly". Choice is a matter of personal preference.

             # Change the stick-figure character.  Pressing [Down-Arrow]
               over the second block from the left will accept the next
               character you type as the cursor to move through the rooms.

             # Select and deselect the diary.  If the diary is deselected,
               any entries to be made to it will be lost.  Press
               [Down-Arrow] into the box over "Diary" to toggle the feature
               on and off.

             # Select a task file.  Press [Down-Arrow] into the rightmost
               box.  The screen will clear, and the prompt "Task File
               Name?" will appear.  If the entry is valid, screen 10 will
               reappear with the new task file indicated.  If you specify a
               new file name, an "empty" task file will be created for you.

                                Information Presented

          Upon entering this screen, the first to-do in the daily list will
          appear.  If the daily list is empty, the text-display area will
          be blank.  Along with the description in the text-display area,
          the stress-grade and priority (for reference only) appear as
          well.


                                      Functions

          There are four things you can do with the to-do displayed on the
          screen:


             # Cycle past it [F1].  Move to the next item in the daily
               list.

             # Register it as done [F3].  Remove it from the daily list;
               when the diary is updated, add it with the notation "C" for
               "completed".

             # Register it as canceled [F5].  Remove it from the daily
               list; when the diary is updated, add it with the notation
               "X" for "canceled".

             # Defer it [F7].  Move it back to the warehouse; no entry is
               made in the diary.


          In addition, pressing [F8] will print a list of the items in the
          daily list to the line printer.

          move to screen 8, where you can see how many items remain in the
          daily list.  Pressing [Left-Arrow] will move to screen 10, where
          you can do miscellaneous functions with files.  Pressing
          [Right-Arrow] will move to screen 12, where you can execute an
          expansion module.

                                       Purpose

          This screen acts as a corridor to TMPC expansion modules.  These
          are software programs that enhance TMPC capabilities; consult
          Acroatix for availability.


                                Information Presented

          If there are no expansion modules present in memory, the screen
          will show a "dead end" corridor.  Otherwise, the screen will show
          the name of the current expansion option in position.  Think of
          this screen as an elevator which moves to different floors.  Each
          expansion module continues the floor plan on its own floor; this
          screen shows which floor you are on.


                                      Functions

          If there are more than one expansion module in memory, pressing
          [Right-Arrow] will select the module to execute, much as
          changing floors in an elevator.


                                        Exits

          There are two possible exits from this screen.  Pressing
          [Left-Arrow] moves to screen 11.  Pressing [Down-Arrow] moves
          into the expansion module.

          [Ed. Note: As of 10/88 there have been no expansion modules made
          available by Acroatix]

                                Information Presented

          This screen shows the weeks of a month on which the repeating
          item occurs.  Note that more than one week can be indicated, by
          the "x" in the corresponding box.  Also, each day of the week is
          individually indicated.  All of the indicated days and weeks are
          combined for the repeating action; for example, if "first week"
          and "third week", "Monday" and "Thursday" were all indicated, the
          item would repeat on Mondays and Thursdays during the first and
          third weeks of every month.  You may have to create more than one
          repeating-entry item for some combinations of dates, such as the
          first Monday and the fourth Friday of every month.


                                      Functions

          You can move the stick figure to any of the weeks or weekdays;
          pressing [Up-Arrow] into the boxes will toggle the weeks
          ([Down-Arrow] for days) on and off.  You can specify the "last"
          week of a month, which could be either the fourth or fifth week.


                                        Exit

          The only exit is to screen 9, where you can modify the warning or
          the description of the item.  If the changes you made to the
          repeating item are such that the current date no longer falls on
          the repeating date, the current date will move forward to the
          first occurrence of the repeating date.  If you exit the screen
          with no weeks (or no weekdays) specified, the repeating date will
          return to whatever it was when you entered the screen.

                                Information Presented

          This screen shows the months of a year on which the repeating
          item occurs.  Note that more than on month can be indicated, by
          the "x" in the corresponding box.  Also, each day of the month is
          individually indicated.  All of the indicated days and months are
          combined for the repeating action; for example, if "January" and
          "September", "1" and "11" were all indicated, the item would
          repeat on the first and eleventh of both January and September. 
          You may have to create more than one repeating-entry item for
          some combinations of dates, such as January 11 and August 31.


                                      Functions

          You can move the stick figure to any of the months or days;
          pressing [Up-Arrow] into the boxes will toggle the days (or
          months) on and off.  You can specify the "last" day of a month,
          which could be the 28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st days.

          You can also restrict the repeating action to business days. 
          Press [Down-Arrow] into the "scan" box, and it will cycle
          between no scan, forward scan, and reverse scan.  When "forward
          scan" is on, the repeating date will occur on the first business
          day after the exact date, if necessary.  For example, if January
          11 is on a Sunday, "forward scan" will put the repeating date on
          January 12, which is a Monday.  Similarly, "backward scan" will

          date.

          The only exit is to screen 9, where you can modify the warning or
          the description of the item.  If the changes you made to the
          repeating item are such that the current date no longer falls on
          the repeating date, the current date will move forward to the
          first day that fills them.  If you exit the screen with no months
          (or no days) specified, the repeating date will return to
          whatever it was when you entered the screen.

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

          The technical reference section discusses topics of a more arcane
          interest than the rest of the manual.  You don't need any of the
          information in this section to be a good user of TMPC; however,
          it might come in handy if you want to write a program on another
          computer to "talk" to TMPC, or if you're just curious about how
          TMPC works.  Because this section is optional, we have made no
          attempt to make it readily understandable - it isn't intended as
          a primer in assembly language programming techniques.


                                    Startup Notes

          When you activate TMPC, several things happen before the first
          screen appears:


             # The last-used task file (or TOM.DO if the program has been
               newly loaded from tape) is opened; if there is no such file,
               the prompt "Task File Name?" appears, and you must type in a
               name.

             # If the file is new, TMPC inserts a set of control stops to
               it - see the section below on task file formats.  If the
               file exists, TMPC checks to make sure that the character
               counts are consistent with the control stops.  If an error
               occurs, a message will appear, and TMPC terminates back to
               the main menu.  After such a termination, you will always
               get a "Task File Name?" prompt.

             # The current date in the Model 100's memory is checked for
               feasibility.  Ridiculous dates, like March 34, are changed
               to the last day of the month.  Only the years 1980 - 2069
               can be used with TMPC.  Note that dates represented as 1900
               - 1969 in the main menu will appear as 2000 - 2069 in TMPC. 
               If an illegal year is set on the menu when TMPC is
               activated, a message will appear and control will return to
               the main menu.

             # A special case occurs on March 1 of leap years.  Since the
               Model 100's ROM software does not recognize leap year, TMPC
               will change March 1 to February 29 unless the task file
               shows February 29 as the last activated date.  This is not a
               perfect "fix", and in some cases (such as when it really is
               March 1, and TMPC was not used on February 29) it will lead
               to errors.  Let the user beware.  [Ed. Note: !]

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

             # If today is more than one day after the last activation date
               (called "LAD") in the task file, both dates appear on the
               screen with the prompt, "proceed?".  This prompt allows a
               user to avoid processing diary entries if the date has been
               erroneously changed.  Further, if the LAD is chronologically
               after DATE$, TMPC will not proceed.  If TMPC stops execution
               at this point, the task file must be re-specified upon the
               next entry.

             # If there are any to-dos in the "processed" section of the
               task file, they are entered in the diary.  Single-date items
               are deleted from the task file once entered into the diary.


          NOTE: No entries to the diary will be made if the diary is
          deactivated; if the Model 100's memory is exhausted while making
          diary entries, TMPC will abort the entry process.  After this
          happens, you should check for possible duplicate entries in the
          diary.


             # The LAD is updated to today in the task file.


                                  Task File Format

          The task file is divided up into seven sections, as follows:


            1. The Header and date. These serve to identify the file as a
               legitimate task file; it seems unlikely enough that any
               other DO file would start with the letters "tMpC"!

            2. To-do warehouse.  An ordered list of all the to-dos in the
               warehouse.

            3. Daily list.  The list of to-dos allocated to be done today.

            4. Processed to-dos.  The list of to-dos waiting to be written
               to the diary and removed from the task file.

            5. Single-date items.

            6. Weekly-repeating items.

            7. Monthly-repeating items.


          Each section (except the first) is variable length, and followed

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

          by a terminating string.  Each is a list of item-blocks, which
          have the following general format:


                                    Header bytes
                                   Character Count
                               Description Characters


          It is the character count which makes a check necessary to make
          sure that the task file is valid.  Even the smallest change could
          send the software off into a list of an indefinite number of
          blocks extending past the file's end.  So, the software checks
          the character counts upon opening the file (and at other times
          too) to ensure that all is well.

          The number and function of the header bytes depend on the
          particular section. Below are descriptions of each set of header
          bytes.  In the descriptions, "bit 0" refers to the least
          significant.  All data is limited to six bits per byte, and every
          value has an offset of 32 added in.  This is crucial.  The
          offsets prevent any characters from having an ASCII of 26 (which
          would terminate the file) or over 127 (which would complicate
          transmission to other computers, etc)


          To-Dos in Sections 2-4 (One byte)

          A bit mask.  Bit 4 is always set. Bits 0 and 1 together indicate
          the stress (0 = unassigned, 1 = level c, etc.).  Bits 2 and 3
          together indicate the priority (0 = unassigned, 1 = priority 1,
          etc.).


          Single-Date Items (6 bytes total)

          The first two bytes are the warning days.  A total of 10 bits are
          used, with the least significant six in the first byte.  The
          maximum value ever put there by TMPC is 999.

          The next three bytes are the date of the appointment, expressed
          as a day, month and year respectively.  Note that these values
          are offset by 32.  The "year" value is the number of years
          elapsed since 1980.  This is the format of the date at the
          beginning of the task file, also.

          The final byte is a flag byte in the form of a bit-mask.  Bits 0
          and 1 are always 0; bit 2 is set if the item has a type "b"
          warning; bit 3 is set if the item is an appointment and reset for
          a memo; bit 4 is always 0; bit 5 is always set.

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information



          Weekly Repeating Items (6 bytes total)

          The first two bytes are the warning period, in the same format as
          fixed-date items.

          The third byte is a bit-mask for the weeks of each month which
          are active; bit 0 is for the first week through bit 5, which is
          for the fifth week.  Bit 6 is for the last week, which can be set
          independently of the fifth or fourth weeks.

          Bytes 4 and 5 form a bit-mask for the weekdays.  Bits 0 through 5
          in byte four are for Sunday through Friday, respectively, and bit
          1 of byte 5 is for Saturday; the remaining bits are not used.

          Byte 6 is a bit-mask.  Bit 0 is always set; bit 1 is always 0;
          bit 2 is set if the warning is type "b"; bit 3 is set for an
          appointment and reset otherwise; bit 4 is always 0; bit 5 is
          always set.


          Monthly Repeating Items (11 bytes total)

          Bytes 1 and 2 are the warning, just as for fixed-date items.

          Bytes 3 through 8 form a bit-mask for the days of the month.  Bit
          0 of byte 3 is for the first day, and bit 1 of byte 8 is for the
          thirty-first day.  Bit 5 of byte 8 is for the last day of the
          month, which can be set independently.

          Bytes 9 and 10 are for the months of the year.  Bit 0 of byte 9
          is for January, and bit 5 of byte 10 is for December.

          Byte 11 is a flag byte in the form of a bit-mask.  Bit 0 is set
          if the date will search, either forward or backward, to the next
          business day.  Bit 1 is always set.  Bit 2 is set if the warning
          is type "b".  Bit 3 is set if the item is an appointment.  Bit 4
          is set if the search for business day is backward, and reset
          otherwise.  Bit 5 is always set.


          Terminators and Empty Sections

          Each section of blocks ends with a terminator of spaces; the
          number of spaces corresponds to the number of header bytes.  So,
          each to-do section terminates with on space, the fixed items and
          weekly-repeating items each end with 6 spaces, and the monthly
          items end with 11 spaces.  These terminators must be in place
          even if there are no items; thus, the minimum legal task file is

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

          33 bytes long: Four header characters, three characters for the
          date, and 26 spaces.


          Example Programs

          Two example BASIC programs come on the tape to illustrate how the
          task file can be manipulated.  The first, PTODO.BA, prints the
          entire contents of the warehouse to the screen.  The second,
          APPT.BA, adds appointments to the single-date section of the
          calendar.  Both programs contain enough comments to document
          themselves.
