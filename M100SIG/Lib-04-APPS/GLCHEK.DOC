GLCHEK is a simple, no frills checkbook program. It is designed for 
keeping track of checks and deposits that have been manually written. 
It also contains a category ("CAT") field for sorting into expense 
categories. GLCHEK integrates with other programs to make a complete, 
simple accounting system.

From the opening menu, you have 6 choices:

"I]nput Data" starts the program for entering checks or deposits into 
a file called CJ.DO (Check Journal). When first starting the program 
you are prompted to enter a starting balance.

  "C]heck Balance" prints the account balance and totals of checks and
deposits to the screen.

  "P]rint Journal" prints a listing of all transactions along with the
summary totals of checks and deposits and the account balance. There 
is no prompt, but the printer must be on.

  "S]tatement Check" reads off the transactions and asks you to check 
them against your bank statement. You are asked if the amount is 
correct, and can then correct the amount to that listed in the 
statement. You are also asked to enter an "X" for each item that has 
"cleared" or been listed on the statement. Each time this part of the 
program is run, only items that haven't been previously checked off 
are shown.

  "R]econciliation" prints out a reconciliation based on the items you
have checked off. All outstanding checks are listed.

No automatic cut off is provided, so it is suggested that periodically
you cut
off part of the CJ.DO file and store it separately. Just make sure 
there are no
uncleared checks in the portion you store away. Check the ending 
balance of the portion you are storing and enter it as a new starting 
balance. Then just add the rest of the checks that you are keeping 
listed using the normal text editor of the Model 100. Carefully follow
the format of commas and line returns and test that you've made no 
errors.

Once you're comfortable with this part of the program you can move on 
to the accounting programs that use the same files.

       UPDATE of Feb. 7, 1987

A few minor enhancements have been added to the program. The input 
screens have been modified and include a standard formatter for dates.
As you enter dates they should be in "MM/DD/YY" format; the slashes 
will be added automatically. By keeping standardized on dating (which 
was totally optional before) date sorts on future programs or user 
developed programs will be possible. The program does not check for 
impossible dates like "13/34/87", so you're on your own there.

The program now checks that "CAT" numbers are correct. This means that
the WTB.DO file must be present when entering checks or deposits. It 
helps to keep a copy of the Chart of Accounts handy when entering 
data. Wrong entries will ask for a correction. Blank entries will self
-cancel.

Also, between entries, the date will automatically reappear and the 
transaction number will increment by one. Either default can be 
accepted by hitting <Enter>, or be overwritten.

If you are using this program as a Check register only and don't want 
"CAT" numbers, you can disable this function by placing an asterisk at
the beginning of lines: 1450, 1514 ,1550 and 5820.
