This is an adress lable print program.  It uses a file made up using DBNEW.100 
with the following fields:

1	First Name
2	Last Name
3	Street Address
4	City
5	State
6	ZIP
7	Salutation
8	xxxx - a 4 digit selection code

The selection code may be made up of either letters or numbers.  They can be 
chosen to mean anything desired in terms of a selection criteria.  For example 
a code might be 0fc4 where

0	for future use
f	family member
c	christmas list
4	send letter quarterly

for each catagory several options might be determined.

When selecting names from a master list, any combination of the 4 digits can be
either ignored or included for selection.

In addition the program allows you to use any string of characters or numbers 
to select addresses from a master list.

The address file can either be in memory or on tape or any other I/O device 
normally allowed by the model 100.

It offers you the option of either printing the lables out as they are selected
or of placing them in another file which you name and then printing them out.

A label is made up of 3 print lines.  The lines can be made up of any 
combination of fields.  The default is:

Line 1	First Name, Last Name
Line 2	Address
Line 3	City, State, ZIP

Defaults also assume a label to be 8 lines long and printing will begin on the 
fifth character position.

Running the program.

After the initial screen, the program will ask if you want to change any 
parameters from the defaults.  If you type 'Y' it will give you menues to 
follow to make changes.

Next it will present you with the files in RAM and ask for a filename.  You can
use the name of any .DO file in RAM or give a filename such as CAS:filename.

It will then ask you to type an output filename if you want a file of the 
selected addresses.  If the input file is in RAM you can designate a CAS: file 
for the output.  Or if the input is from CAS or RAM you can define RAM as the 
output file.

Next it will promt you for the destination of the lables.  Acceptable outputs 
are RAM filenames (do not use RAM: in this case, just the filename), LPT: (the 
default if no other response is given), LCD:....  In the case of anything other
than RAM do use the colon after the 3 letters.  This is important to proper 
operation of the program.

Finally it will ask for the selection criteria.  You have two basic choices 
here:

First, any character/letter string that might occur in any field of any 
address, including the selection code field.

Second, type 'code'.  This limits you to the code field only and takes you to 
another menu.  You can type in any combination of the 4 code digits that might 
occur in one or more addresses.  You can also enter lower case 'x' in any of 
the 4 digits that you do not care about.  For example, xfxx would select all 
address that have an f in the second position in the selection code regardless 
of what is in the other 3 positions.  This is a very useful capability.

At this point the program does its thing.  The only other interaction required 
is in the event you named a CAS: file for an output file.  After the file is 
written to cassette it will ask you to rewind the cassette and put it to 'play'
so it can be read in and then printed out.

Upon completion it returns to the model 100 menu.
