Multiplan will not run if himem is less than 58261.

Contrary to the documentation, when it is installed in a M100, it will not
appear on the menu. I recommend putting the following program on your menu:

	1 CALL63012

(mine is named MP.BA)

Multiplan *does* install itself on the menu of a M102 (as MSPLAN). Be sure to
save all files before installing the chip. I merely installed the chip in a
friend's 102 and when we turned the power on, *cold start*. And for some
reason, this cold start clobbered the files as well as the directory <sigh>.

************BUG WARNING**********************

When loading data from a SYLK file, Multiplan "loses" minus signs. --
Specifically, if there is a constant whose value is greater than -1 and less
than 0 it will lose the leading minus!

Placing an "=" in front of the number makes it a formula, and avoids the
problem.

**********TRANSFERRING SYLK FILES FROM OTHER MACHINES************

At work I use Multiplan 3.0 on an AT.

At some point between V1.0 (which we still have a copy of) and V3.0, Microsoft
changed the format of SYLK files. Now all constants have an apostrophe "'" in
front of them in the SYLK file. To make these files usable on the 100/102,
remove these "'". (I use a text editor on the PC and do a global replace).

V3.0 on the AT has no problems reading M100 SYLK files.
