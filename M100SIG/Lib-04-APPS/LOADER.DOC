LOADER.DOC

	This is my shell loader/utility for use with TMPC by Acroatix.  It is a distillation of bits and pieces of code from many SIG contributors and I thank them all in aggregate rather than trying to identify each bit and piece of code.  I hope it is useful for those who find TMPC as terrific as I do.

	I use PCSG's 64K RAM board and Chipmunk routinely.  This shell is aimed at the nagging household chores associated with those two peripherals as well as quick and dirty adjuncts to TMPC.  I normally keep TMPC and my phone list in one of the three banks of RAM and use the other two for daily work.

	LOADER.BA is menu driven and utilizes Function keys throughout.  A description of each key and what it does follows:

F1 - Phn#:  This key calls up the routine stolen from TODO.PJP in DL2.  You must build a text file called FONE.DO with your phone numbers in it.  Last names or lookup codes MUST be in ALL CAPS.  Spacing is self-evident by inspection as you go.

F2 - STMP:  This key looks to see if TMPC is loaded in HIMEM.  If it is, TMPC will be saved as TMPC.CO and himem cleared out.

F3 - Srch:  This key calls up a routine stolen en toto from SEARCH.MPC in DL4 and allows you to search your task file - very handy.  Note:  my default task file is SKED.DO.  Be sure to put yours in line 13.

F4 - RTMP:  This key loads and/or runs TMPC.  The routine also looks for CDOS and if it is there, kills it.

F5 - Appt:  This calls a routine stolen from one of Acroatix's utilities to allow automatic entering of appointments and/or memos to the task file in bunches.  You open a text file called APPT.DO and enter your appointments/memos as follows:

	MM/DD/YY Time (optional) Text

The routine will automatically insert them and then kill the APPT.DO file.

F6 - Lock:  This runs a .BA program called LOCK.BA which can be any basic password program which provides simple security.  Note:  DON'T use a password program that is in M/L.  Problems that they cause with TMPC you don't need.

F7 - Bank:  This runs a short bank switching program I use.  See BANK.BA in this DL.

F8 - Exit:  Exits to the M100 menu.

	I hope this is useful for you.  I know the devious minds out there will improve greatly on my efforts as I am, as many of you are, an amateur who knows just enough to be dangerous.  Comments, suggestions and - especially - improvements will be appreciated.
