          This screen is always the first one you will see upon entering
          TMPC.  So, start from here to follow Tom through his daily
          procedure of setting today's workload for himself.  As the first
          step, he presses [Down-arrow] (just once) to move to the screen
          below this one:



                                      Screen 5

          This screen, like the one above it, contains only corridors and
          information.  Tom moves on without stopping by pressing
          [Right-Arrow].  Yet another screen appears:



                                      Screen 6

          This screen shows today's appointments and memos.  Notice the two
          numbers in the inverse video portion of the screen.  The "0"
          means that there are no items in the list above what are shown;
          the "2" at the bottom means that two more items are off the
          bottom of the screen.

          Tom looks at the appointments.  Both of the meetings are going to
          be relatively short, he knows; further, because he is a counselor
          for Junior Achievement, he normally works late on Wednesdays, in
          order to go straight there from work.  Then, he presses
          [Right-Arrow] into the box with a "p", which stands for "page
          forward".  Do this and you will see the screen change as follows:

          Tom looks at these deadlines: a standard activity report due in
          just two more business days, and a sales-related presentation to
          a potential customer in a week.  With a rough idea of how busy
          the day will be, and what the most urgent deadlines are, Tom
          proceeds to look at what remains undone from yesterday.

          Press [Left-Arrow] and [Down-Arrow] to show another screen:



                                      Screen 8

          This screen enumerates the things to be done today.  Since this
          is the first time Tom has entered TMPC today, these are things
          left undone from yesterday.  TMPC categorizes activities in two
          different ways:


             # One of three levels of stress.  Stress "A" jobs are
               exhausting, stress "B" jobs are average, and stress "C: jobs
               are light or enjoyable.  Of course, you will have your own
               ideas about what is difficult and what is easy or fun.  This
               screen categorizes to-dos by stress level.

                          Lesson 1: Setting the Daily List

             # One of three levels of priority.  Priority 1 to-dos should
               be done immediately; priority 2 to-dos should be done within
               a few days, and priority 3 jobs can be done when convenient. 
               This screen shows nothing about priority, but other screens
               do.


          In our example, Tom sees that there is one of each type of
          project left undone from yesterday; he presses [Down-Arrow] to
          look at them.  The following screen appears:



                                      Screen 11
                      ******************* ********************
                                         %                    
                      ****************************************
                      ****Synquil Slides                  ****
                      ****                                ****
                      ****************************************
                      ****Priority 1********Grade B Stress****
                      Cycle*****Done******Cancel****Delay*LPT*



          The text in the box describes one of the things left undone.  Tom
          looks at all three by pressing the [F1] key ("cycle") several
          times.  He decides that the two items for Synquil better be
          finished today.  However, the 8086 reading is low priority; it
          should wait until some other time.  He presses [F5] ("delay") to
          move the project back to the warehouse.

          There are two places where TMPC stores to-dos.  The warehouse is
          a holding area where you put every task that you are thinking
          about doing or must do "some time".  From the warehouse, you
          select a daily list at the beginning of each workday.  Your goal
          should always be to finish all of your to-dos on the daily list
          before close of business.  Tom left three things undone; he is
          not unduly annoyed, since an unexpected (and productive)
          conversation pre-empted three of his to-dos.  There are no really
          pressing deadlines this week.

          Tom now has two to-dos on his daily list.  Normally, he shoots
          for two with "grade A stress", two or three with "grade B
          stress", and a few with "grade C stress" - never more than ten in
          all.  To complete the selection, he moves to another screen. 
          Press [Up-Arrow] [Left-Arrow].  (On the way, notice that the
          "grade C stress" number is now zero, since that to-do has been
          moved back into the warehouse.)  The screen you see will look
          like this:

                                       Page: 6

                                      Screen 7
                      ************************************* **
                      *Correspondence file:  clear     **** **
                      *                                **** **
                      ************************************* **

                      ***********************************reset
                      Cycle******Do*******Cancel**************



          The text shown is for the first to-do in the warehouse.  The
          warehouse always sorts to-dos by priority first; within priority,
          it sorts by increasing stress.  This is because you should do the
          fun, urgent things right away.  Accordingly, the to-do displayed
          is priority 1 and stress level "C". Tom selects this one for the
          daily list with [F3] ("do").  The next item in the warehouse
          appears in the box.

          Using [F1] ("cycle") and [F3], Tom moves through the warehouse to
          select all of his daily list.  We won't show each one here;
          instead, as an exercise, choose each of the following:



               Fix presentation slides
               J.A. marketing presentation
               Work out Beta Industries lab plan
               Write activity summary


          This selection makes a total of seven to-dos in the daily list. 
          To verify the count, look at the summary in the screen to the
          right by pressing [Right-Arrow].  The summary shows one "C", four
          "B's" and two "A's".  This is a moderately heavy amount of work
          for a day with two meetings and Tom rolls up his sleeves to get
          at them.

          You will undoubtedly come up with your own philosophy about daily
          list selection.  Everyone has their won preferences, but we have
          one very important piece of advice: don't be too ambitious. 
          Over-ambition is being dishonest with yourself, and in the long
          run will discourage you from using TMPC.  If you face an
          impossible workload, face the situation squarely - don't pretend
          to be superhuman.

                          Lesson 1: Setting the Daily List

          As the final step to his daily selection, Tom moves back to the
          "process to-do" screen.  This is the first of several returns
          there today, as he completes the tasks he has assigned himself. 
          Now, however, he simply presses [F8] ("print") to make a hard
          copy of the list.  This step requires a printer.

          Finally, Tom exits TMPC by typing four up-arrows.  This concludes
          the first lesson.  As an exercise, we recommend that you move
          through the screens of TMPC on your own.  Don't enter any
          "dead-end" corridors, since doing so can change the task file. 
          Instead, move around the screens until you feel generally
          confident about "where you are" at any point.
