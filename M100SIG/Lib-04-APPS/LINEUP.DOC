   LINEUP.BA writes a formatted lineup for TV or radio broadcasts.  It shows 
the total time of the broadcast as each page is entered and does running times
when you printout.  You can print to the screen, which is the easiest way to
keep track of what you're doing.
   You can insert or delete lines by entering the proper command after you
refuse the printout option.  You can change a line at any time by simply
entering in the line number at the Page # prompt.  If you don't specify a page
number, it will automatically assume that you want a new page at the end.
  USE ALL CAPS!!
  You can save a format and load it again if you generally use the same
opening pages, commercial breaks, etc.  Then all you have to do is change the
pages for new information.
  Specific mods are possible...let me know.

  p.s  putting "CX" in a line will cause it to be bracketted with lines on 
the printout...for commercials.
