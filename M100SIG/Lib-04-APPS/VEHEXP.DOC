******* VEHICLE EXPENSE PROGRAM *******
****************** by *****************
*********** L. W. Leedy III ***********
************ DOCUMENTATION ************

I wrote this program after being notified by my accountant that I must keep 
better records of my vehicle use in my business.  I primarily use my vehicle on

long trips lasting up to a week and traveling over several hundred miles.  This

is the reason the program records its data in this format.  I don't know if 
this program will fulfill your needs but you are welcome to use it.  Please 
check with your accountant or tax professional as to the adequacy of this 
program for your particular needs.  

******** OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS *******

After an initial screen you are presented with 4 options.

1.  (H)  HEADING:  Opens a file called VEHEXP.DO and asks you 4 questions which

are placed at the top of the file.  
         A.  Trip purpose:
         B.  Destination:
         C.  Vehicle: In case you own and use more than one vehicle.
         D.  Operator: 

The underlines indicate the maximum number of characters allowed per entry.  
Your answer will be truncated if you go over.  

2.  (G)  GASOLINE EXPENSES:  Appends the following information to VEHEXP.DO.
         A.  Starting Mileage:  Mileage at each beginning of trip.  After the 
first fillup all you have to do is press enter and the last ending mileage is 
inserted.  Then press enter.
         B.  Ending Mileage:  Mileage at the fillup.  
         C.  Number of Gallons of Gas:  Less than 99.9 gallons to one decimal 
point.
         D.  Total Cost of Gas:  Less than 999.99 to two decimal points.

After you press enter your Miles Per Gallon will be shown on the screen.  The 
day, date, and time will be appended to the above information and then placed 
in VEHEXP.DO.  You will then be returned to the menu.

3.  (M)  MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES:
         A.  Enter Mileage:  Mileage at service, oil change, tires, etc.
         B.  Description of Item:  35 character description of expense.
         C.  Total Cost: Total cost, not cost of each item.

4.  (T)  TOTAL EXPENSES:  This option totals all expenses in VEHEXP.DO and 
displays them on the screen and presents you with the option of appending this 

to the end of VEHEXP.DO.  You can use this to keep tabs on your expenses.  Do 
not append this to the file until the end of the trip.  If you do your next 
total will be grossly incorrect.

F8 takes you from the menu out of the program and returns you to the Model 
100's Main Menu.

VEHEXP.DO is formated to be printed at 80 columns and should be ready to turn 
in to your accountant as is.

I have tried to trap most of the errors I could think of division by zero, file

errors, incorrect figures, etc.   If you come up with any others Please notify 

me so I may include them.  Leave any suggestions via E Mail to:
