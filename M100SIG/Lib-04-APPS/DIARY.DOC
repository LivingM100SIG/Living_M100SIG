A brief history of DIARY.400
----------------------------

Although I consider DIARY to be a perpetual
calendar/scheduling program, there are commercial programs
on the market with similar abilities and advertised as "time
management" programs.  I think this description is extremely
misleading... DIARY does not manage your time... just helps
you schedule it!

DIARY was written in 1983 and has gone through many
revisions.  I had written no less than three machine
language versions of the program, but kept running into
problems [I don't feel like distributing a program that
complains about other programs in RAM, and could not find
any easy way around it].

Anyway, looking back at the code for DIARY.301, I found two
problems:

 - It required a small M/L ALPHA.CO file to be resident
 - It required SUBLIB.CO to be resident

The ALPHA.CO file was used for a quick "capitalization"
routine (so searches would find text whether it was in lower
or upper case).  The "problem" with this was
  1) it required to be stored in a specific location in RAM
  2) it may not be in RAM, making DIARY abort with a rather
     obscure error message.
These problems have been alleviated with a new file called
"DIARY.CO", which is loaded if found in the directory, or is
created if it is not found.  The creation routines relocate
the DIARY.CO just under the current value of HIMEM, enabling
it to work with just about any type of setup (CDOS, Bullet,
Supera, PRO-AID, etc.)

The SUBLIB.CO file was a very early submission into the
Model 100's public domain, and when DIARY was first written,
I assumed EVERYBODY would have SUBLIB on their machine,
which has proven me wrong!  SUBLIB was only used for a SORT
function, which has now been removed from the program.


How to load DIARY
-----------------

If you downloaded this program via TELCOM as "DIARY.DO", you
must first convert this program into a .BA file.  You can do
this by entering BASIC and typing:
  LOAD "DIARY.DO"


You will see the word "Wait" flash underneath your command. 
If you get the message "?OM Error", then you either do not
have enough RAM for both the .DO and the .BA file, or you
have a few other large programs in memory.  If you have a
16K machine, you will find that DIARY.DO takes up over 10K
and DIARY.BA almost 7K, which is more than 16K together.  If
this is the case:
  1. Enter the DIARY.DO file,
  2. Save it to cassette using the F3 (Save) function,
     and "Save to: DIARY"
  3. Enter Basic and KILL "DIARY.DO"
  4. Rewind the tape and then CLOAD "DIARY"

If you have more than 16K but a lot of files, you may wish
to save you other files to cassette (or disk, if you have
one) and then try loading DIARY.DO again.


How to run DIARY
----------------

Simply select DIARY.BA from the Menu and the program will
run.  A copyright notice will appear briefly [although it's
public domain, I still retain rights to the sale of the
program... you can give it away, but if you sell it, that is
illegal].

If the DIARY.CO file is not found in RAM, Diary will create
one.  If you are watching the screen and see the copyright
message disappear and then come back, that is probably what
happened.

If the NOTE.DO file is not found, it will be created and a
message will be displayed to attest to that fact.

If you get a message "?SN Error in 193", just type "RUN"
and press the ENTER key.  I do not know why it does that,
but if I find out why, I'll upload a fix.  However, this is
not an earth-shattering problem.

DIARY is all ready for work once it displays the calendar
for the current month (with the current date highlighted).
This is known as the "Calendar" screen.

If the calendar is not for the current month, you might want
to exit the program and reset your DATE$ variable.  Note
that DIARY has a perpetual calendar.  If you have DAY$ set
incorrectly, it will not bother DIARY.  While you are
setting the DATE$ variable, you may also want to set TIME$
correctly since it is displayed constantly.

To exit Diary, just press the F8 (Menu) key.


All right, now what?
--------------------

Once you are at the Calendar screen, you are ready to use
Diary.  First, be forewarned... Diary has a "chirping" alarm
that beeps twice every hour on the hour when it is running. 
I like the feature on my watch so much that I programmed it
in.  It can be removed... see the section on customizing
DIARY.

At the Calendar screen, you have a few options.

You will notice that the current date is highlighted.  This
is reffered to as the "cursor" and can be moved around.

By pressing an ARROW key, you will move the cursor in that
direction.

LEFT Arrow      Moves the cursor one day foreward
RIGHT Arrow     Moves the cursor one day backward
UP Arrow        Moves the cursor one week backward
DOWN Arrow      Moves the cursor one week foreward

Additionally, the F4 (Prev) and F5 (Next) key position you
to the start of either the Previous or Next months,
respectively.

Well.... that looks like fun!  But useful???

If this was all that was to DIARY, it would be a big
disappointment.  However, there's more!

VIEWing Entries
---------------

Diary is more than a perpetual calendar.  It also helps you
schedule your time.

Selecting the F1 (View) function will display any entries in
the NOTE.DO file for the date that is selected.  Each entry
will be displayed, one at a time.  If there is no reference
to that date in the NOTE.DO file, a message will be
displayed ("... not found in NOTE  .DO file").

When an entry is displayed, you have the following options:

F1 (Next)       Proceed to the next entry in the NOTE.DO
                for the selected date.

F1 (Cont)       If the entry is too long to fit on one
                screen, the F1 key will be labelled "Cont". 
                Pressing F1 at this time will display the
                rest of the entry.

F4 (Chg)        This selction allows you to modify the entry
                currently being displayed.

F5 (Add)        This selection will allow you to add an
                entry into the NOTE.DO file.

F6 (Del)        This selection allows you to delete the
                entry currently being displayed.  This will
                not occur, however, until it is confirmed.

F8 (Exit)       Pressing F8 will return you to the Calendar
                screen.

When there are no more entries, the message "n entries
found" (where "n" is the number of entries in the NOTE.DO
file for the current date).  At this point, the F5 (Add) and
F8 (Exit) functions are the only ones available.


Editing Commands
----------------

When you are adding or changing an entry, you will see a
flashing cursor which will show your current place in the
entry.

Pressing the LEFT or RIGHT arrow will move the cursor
forward or backward through the characters in the entry. 
Note that you can not go past the end of the entry or prior
to the beginning.  The BACKSPACE key is identical to he LEFT
arrow key.

Pressing DEL (Shift-Backspace) will cause the character
under the cursor to be deleted and all text to the right
will be shifted to the left.

Pressing ESC will insert a space at the cursor position and
all the text to the right will be shifted to the right one
space.

Press ENTER when the addition or modification is complete.

DIARY informs you that CAPS or NUM lock keys are on by
displaying their status in reverse video on the bottom of
the screen when they are on.

The F7 (Eras) key will erase all text in the entry.

The F8 (Abrt) key will cancel all edits made and return to
the entry display.


Other functions
---------------

From the Calendar screen, there are three additional
functions:

F3 (Srch)       Allows you to search the NOTE.DO file for
                any particular text string.  Note that case
                (upper/lower) is ignored.

F6 (Adrs)       This function is similar to the F3 (Srch)
                function, except the ADRS.DO file is
                searched.

F7 (Off)        Powers off your Model 100.  Note that just
                switching off the machine does not perform
                the same function, since the graphic "box"
                around the Month/Year and Time will
                disappear.  This function is more for
                aesthetics than anything else.

ENTER           The ENTER key acts the same as the F1 (View)
                key.  Thus, DIARY offers the same commands
                as the main Model 100 MENU.


Compatibility
-------------

NEC 8201

Sorry... this program uses the PRINT @ function extensively. 
It would require a rewrite.  It is possible, but I do not
think I am the one that will be doing it.


Tandy 200

The program will not run on a Tandy 200 without a major rewrite.  Too many
peeks and pokes that will need to be changed.


CDOS and M/L "Utilities"

From initial reports, DIARY is "clean".  That is to say,
DIARY does not bother other programs, and they do not bother
DIARY.  So far, CDOS and Supera have been tested.  In fact,
I would be interested in hearing about ANY program that
gives DIARY a hard time (or vice versa).


Customization
-------------

ADRS and NOTE files

  The default Address and Note files may be modified by
  loading the "DIARY" in Basic and typing EDIT 162.

  Assign the value of your Note file to the variable "DF" and
  your Address file to the variable "AF".

  For example,

  162 ...:DF="NOTE  .DO":AF="ADRS  .DO":... etc

  Assigns NOTE.DO to DF and ADRS.DO to AF


Getting rid of the "Chirper"

  The "chirper" is the "BEEP BEEP" that occurs every hour on
  the hour.  If you REALLY want to get rid of it, load
  "DIARY" in Basic and EDIT 162:

  Remove the GOSUB175: statement from the line so it reads:

  162 AU="... etc


Adding a SORT routine

  I took out the Sort code in DIARY for a couple of reasons,
  one being the relative obscurity of the SUBLIB m/l file. 
  It is big, bulky, and not necessary for the practical
  running of DIARY.

  Since DIARY was released, a pretty good programmer named
  Rick Perry has written a program called ALARMS that
  provides a perpetual alarm (it will interrupt ANYTHING as
  long as the Model 100 is on) and a pretty nice SORT
  routine.  If you need a SORT routine, I would recommend
  putting this program into you RAM and then adding the
  following:

  128 RUN"ALARMS"
  167 L1="View Alrm Srch Prev Next Adrs Off  Menu"

  This will set F2 (Alrm) to run the ALARMS program, which
  will then be able to sort your NOTE.DO file.  Simple, eh?


Any more enhancements?
----------------------

It's doubtful, but always possible.  For instance, DIARY.301
was supposed to be the "last version of DIARY in BASIC".  I
was wrong once...


Anyway, there will be at least one more version, with all
the line numbers resequenced.  The code is still pretty
tight, even though I patched it for the .400 release, but
could probably be reduced.  However, the code is so dense
right now that I do not know if it is indeed a worthwhile
modification.


Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to all the people who have been using and commenting
on the DIARY programs since Day 1.

Jesse Bob Overholt, who was the author of SUBLIB.CO, without
which the first version(s) of DIARY would not have been
feasible and therefore possible.

Sysop Dave (and Mortimer) for suggesting a new DIARY at the
same time I was considering it (sheer providence, no?).

All those whose time and efforts on the M/L versions of
Diary (which may yet be released) were helpful.
