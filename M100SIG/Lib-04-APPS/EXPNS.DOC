   The EXPNS series, submitted by R. Scott Truesdell, 70506,553, is designed as 
an easy-to-use, powerful, yet compact multiple account expense manager.  There
are three separate files that comprise the set:
   EXPNS.DOC (xxxx bytes)  this document, an instruction manual of sorts.
   EXPNS.RUN (1614 bytes)  the compacted executable program.
   EXPNS.LST (4185 bytes)  a heavily commented listing of EXPNS.RUN.
Both EXPNS.RUN and EXPNS.LST are executable and perform identically. I included
the .LST file so hackers and byte-fighters would have an easier time following 
the flow of the program.
   EXPNS is capable of maintaining a maximum of 18 files, called accounts, 
limited by the directory space of the MODEL 100. The maximum size of the 
accounts is limited by available RAM.  The program provides the following 
functions:
   Create a new account.
   Bring up an existing account.
   Add expense items to a new or existing account.
   Review a descriptive list of expenses in any account.
   Sum up all expenses in any account.
   The option of turning off the computer and resuming with the most recently 
       accessed account upon subsequent power-ups.
   When the program is executed, a list of files appears on the screen and you 
are prompted for an account name.  If you wish to quit the program at this 
time, you may press <ENTER> at the "Which Account" prompt.  If you wish to use 
an existing account, type in a name from the list.  If you wish to create a new 
account, type in a name NOT already on the list. The program automatically 
truncates the filename to 6 characters, converts to upper case, and tacks on 
the ".DO" extension.  The program does not create a new file until you enter 
the ADD mode so if you mistype the name of an existing file, you may recover 
gracefully without having created an empty file in the directory.
   * BUG (FEATURE!) *  In order to  conserve bytes, the "Which Account" prompt 
displays all .DO files.  If you name a non-EXPNS file, the program will allow 
you to append merrily away, though the REVIEW and TOTAL functions may crash.
   Select your desired function from the MENU.  Attempts to REVIEW or SUM an 
account with no entries will take you to the "Which Account" screen.
   The ADD function keeps looping, asking for new item entries, until you 
press <ENTER> at the "What for" prompt.  You may enter receivables and 
reimbursements into the account as negative numbers.
   The REVIEW function is paged by pressing any key.  Both the REVIEW and SUM 
functions are completed by pressing any key.  Reports may be printed by using 
the MODEL 100's <PRINT> key.
   There are three ways to exit from program.  If you press "Q" from the main 
menu, the program returns control to the MODEL 100's menu.  This is the normal 
exit.  However, if you press <ESC>, the program executes a "POWER OFF, RESUME" 
command.  This, in effect, turns the machine into dedicated expense manager.  
You may also press <ENTER> at the "Which Account" prompt.
   The code structure of the program is not very elegant as this program has 
evolved over 8 months of "in the field" use.  It works, though, is moderately 
compact, and non-computer people find it easy to learn and use.
   This program doesn't have all the features of ERICKSON and SAYRE's "TRAVEL 
MASTER" but it is much smaller and easier to use "on the run".  The size may be
slightly reduced by carefully combining some lines.  I kept the line length 
less than 80 whenever possible to facilitate CompuServe transfers. A few lines 
do go over though.... Hope they make it through...  Enjoy.
