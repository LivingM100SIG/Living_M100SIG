          In the last lesson, we showed how Tom begins each workday by
          selecting a daily list from a warehouse of to-dos.  In this
          lesson, we will examine the warehouse more closely.  As with any
          warehouse, the notion of "in" and "out" is very important, so
          keep it in mind during the lesson.


                                   The Inspiration

          Sporadically throughout the day, Tom will enter TMPC with an
          "inspiration", which is a sudden idea for a to-do.  These
          inspirations can result from reading magazine articles, getting
          phone call, or conversations with fellow employees.  When they
          occur, Tom likes to record inspirations quickly, then get on with
          his business.  In this way, he avoids daydreaming and remembers
          things later.

          As Tom is fixing the presentation slides, he suddenly realizes
          that a simulation program may give better results with a
          different kind of input.  He enters TMPC. (Do so yourself to
          follow along.)  Then, he presses [Left-Arrow].  The screen
          appears:



                                      Screen 1
                      ****************************************

                      ************************************* **

                      ************************************* **
                      *Unassigned********Unassigned******** **



          Then, he presses [Up-Arrow].  At this point, TMPC enters the TEXT
          program on the Model 100.  Tom knows how to use TEXT; if you
          don't, see page 19 of the Model 100 owner's manual.  Meanwhile,
          Tom enters in a quick description, such as "alternate simulations
          runs".  Then, he presses [F8] to exit TEXT.  He now sees the same
          screen as before, except with the new inspiration on it.  After a
          quick check of the text, he exits TMPC by pressing [Right-Arrow]
          [Up-Arrow].  You should get in the habit of recording your
          inspirations with TMPC.

                         Lesson 2: Maintaining the Warehouse



                                The Warehouse Cleanup

          The to-do warehouse, like any warehouse, becomes cluttered and
          disorganized unless it receives regular attention.  Tom spends
          some time each week attending to this organization.  He chooses
          some time when he is at his best - attentive and decisive.  It is
          hard work, since he must evaluate to-dos for stress and
          priority, and break up large to-dos into smaller ones.  These
          tasks require judgment.

          You may have noticed that the inspiration above had no stress or
          priority assigned to it.  Instead, both showed as "unassigned". 
          With a few exceptions, most inspirations go into the warehouse
          unassigned.  However, TMPC will not allow you to select them for
          the daily list until you assign both stress and priority.  It is
          a discipline; it forces you to learn what you do best and what
          your real priorities are.  If you're like most people, the
          results may surprise you.

          Some inspirations are for entire projects - much more than a few
          hour's work.  TMPC cannot prevent you from putting these large
          to-dos on your daily list, but it is a bad idea. You should try
          to break to-dos up into small enough units that 5-10 of them will
          fill a day.  If your vocation naturally involves large projects,
          break them down into smaller tasks.  Otherwise, you will quickly
          lose all interest in tracking your to-dos. It makes little more
          sense to put a two-week project on the daily list than to put the
          words, "do my job". You will not benefit from the monitoring, the
          reinforcement, or the archiving functions unless you break big
          projects down to size.  If it seems like useless work to do so,
          you should think carefully about your working habits.  If may be
          that this approach to to-dos is genuinely ill-suited to your
          job; if so, however, you are a rare exception.

          Thus, the three main tasks associated with a warehouse cleanup
          are prioritizing, assigning stress levels, and breaking up big
          projects into manageable tasks.  In addition, you may have second
          thoughts about a to-do in the warehouse and decide to discard it
          of defer it indefinitely.  We will follow Tom as he goes through
          this process in miniature.

          Enter TMPC and press [Down-Arrow].  You will see a summary of the
          to-dos in the warehouse:

          The number to watch is the number of "unassigned" to-dos, since
          these will be the focus of the warehouse cleanup.  (The number of
          priority 1 to-dos is interesting as well; if all your to-dos are
          priority 1, something is probably going haywire.)  After
          examining the count of unassigned to-dos, Tom moves into the
          warehouse by pressing [Left-Arrow].  The following screen
          appears:



                                      Screen 4

          If you remember the list of the day's appointments and deadlines,
          you will notice the similar format.  You may also remember that
          the "p" box moves the list forward by one page.  Notice the
          headings for priorities and for unassigned items.

          The first item listed on the screen (shown in inverse video) is
          the "selected" item.  Press [Up-Arrow] to move between the "+"
          and the "-" boxes.  These boxes will move the selected item up
          and down in the list.  Tom selects the second item ("alternate
          simulation runs") by pressing [Right-Arrow], then presses
          [Up-Arrow] to move to the screen above the warehouse:

          This is the same screen you saw above in the "inspiration"
          section, except that the text-display area contains the selected
          to-do.  Tom has decided that this to-do is priority 2,
          stress-grade "A"; accordingly, he presses [Left-Arrow] to move
          over the priority box, presses [Down-Arrow] twice, presses
          [Left-Arrow] to move over the stress box, presses [Down-Arrow]
          once, then presses [Right-Arrow] twice.  When he returns to the
          warehouse by pressing [Down-Arrow], the to-do will be in its
          proper position, and the next to-do in the warehouse will be
          selected.  You can also change priorities and stress levels after
          you have assigned them - Tom finds he must often "upgrade" the
          priority of a to-do as it becomes more urgent that he finish it.

          Tom decides that "Drynan Results" is too large to be a single
          to-do.  So, he selects it (by pressing [Left-Arrow]) and moves
          back to the editing screen with [Up-Arrow].  Then, he moves into
          TEXT by pressing [Up-Arrow] again.  Once in the editor, he
          changes it to look as follows:

                         Lesson 2: Maintaining the Warehouse

          Notice that the ENTER key separates the three to-dos in the file. 
          Then, Tom presses [F8] to leave TEXT.  The screen looks as
          follows:



                                      Screen 1
                      ****************************************
                      *Get sales approval for Drynan - *******
                      *call TSD                        *edit**
                      ************************************* **
                      *                                    %  
                      * ***************** ***************** **
                      ************************************* **
                      *Unassigned********Unassigned******** **



          As always, the screen shows the last to-do in the group he
          added.  Tom assigns it priority 3, stress grade "C", and moves
          back to the warehouse.  By pressing [Left-Arrow], he selects the
          next previous to-do from the file he entered; he assigns it
          priority 2 and stress grade "B".  Similarly, he selects the first
          to-do in his expanded file and assigns it priority 2 and stress
          level "C".  A quick return to the screen to the right (press
          [Right-Arrow]) shows that there are no unassigned to-dos left in
          the warehouse; the cleanup is almost complete.

          As the final step, Tom cycles through every item in the warehouse
          in the selection screen.  (This is where we selected a daily list
          in the last lesson.  To get there, press [Down-Arrow]
          [Left-Arrow]).  Tom uses [F1] to examine each item; he decides
          that "JFFI Research memo" has been sitting too long, and there is
          no time to do it.  So, he deletes it with [F5].

          At this point, we have shown all of the basic techniques for
          using the warehouse.  To-dos enter the warehouse through
          "inspirations", and by breaking down large to-dos into smaller
          ones.  (you can also return to the warehouse from the daily
          list, as we showed in Lesson 1.)  To-dos move from the unassigned
          area to the assigned area when you give them priority and stress
          ratings.  They leave the warehouse by deletion, or by selection
          into the daily list.  We highly encourage you to think of your
          job in terms of tasks to be done, and to track them with TMPC.
