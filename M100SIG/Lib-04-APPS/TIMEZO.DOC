   This file is the documentation for 
TIMEZO.BAS. The program calculates the 
current time and day in selected cities.
   The program is written is standard 
Microsoft Basic, with screen layouts 
designed for 8x40 or 8x80. With changes 
to the date and time instructions, this 
should run on most machines.
   The version uploaded is ready-to-run 
on a Tandy model 100, Nec 8201 or 
Ollivetti M10.
   To run on a Epson PX-8, delete line 
1300, and remove the first 
apostrophe from lines 50 and 1280.
   When you are prompted for a city name 
by the program, upper and lower case are 
accepted, and a short name is sufficient 
(e.g. LON for London).
   Add or delete any cities you like by 
modifying lines 10000+. Remember to also 
alter line 16000, the city count.
Each data line should contain the name 
(in quotes), comma, the time difference 
from GMT/UTC in decimal hours, comma, 
DST details: "?" if you're not sure, " " 
if there is never DST, or start and 
finish dates for DST in the form "mmdd-
mmdd". Remember to SAVE to the program 
when you've changed it.
   This is a preliminary test version, 
please send you comments, suggestions 
and bug reports to Robert Hoare, CIS 
74116,537 or Source BCX713.
