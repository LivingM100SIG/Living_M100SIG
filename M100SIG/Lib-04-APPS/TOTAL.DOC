TOTAL -- Column Totals

Copyright 1983  Michael M Rubenstein


Description.

TOTAL computes totals and subtotals for
selected columns in a table.  TPRINT
prints a table in a pretty format.


Data Format

The input file for TOTAL and TPRINT
consists of any number of lines.

The first line contains column
headings, separated by tabs (one tab
between headings).

The second line contains print format
specificataions (in the form for PRINT
USING) for each column, again separated
by tabs.

Following lines contain the data, with
columns again separated by tabs.

Interspersed with the data there may be
lines begining with an asterisk ("*").
Such lines are treated specially,
depending on the second character of
the line:

	T or t  --  Totals are inserted
	S or s  --  Subtotals are
		    inserted
	other   --  The line is copied
		    to the output
		    unchanged

The second line, the format line, is
used by TPRINT.  It is ignored by
TOTAL.  Any format specification legal
in a PRINT USING statement may be used,
but the length of the specification
must be the same as the desired length
of the field.  Thus, you must use

	#,###,###.##

instead of

	#######,.##


Use of TOTAL

When TOTAL is run, it will request the
input and output file names.  Any
filenames legal for input and output
to BASIC programs may be used, but only
RAM files (the default) are likely to
be very useful.  The .DO extension need
not be specified.  If you respond to
the request for the output file with a
return, the input file will be
overwritten.

TOTAL will then ask for fields.
Specify each column to be totaled
either by name (the heading for the
column -- case is significant) or by
number (preceded by "#").  After
last column to be totaled, respond with
return.


Use of TPRINT

TPRINT asks for the input file name,
then the output file name.  If you
respond return to the output file name,
the output will be to the LCD display.


Example.

The file TOTAL.SMP is a sample input
file for TOTAL.  The output from total
for this file, totaling on column 3,
Amount, is contained in TOTAL1.SMP.
The output of TPRINT on TOTOUT.SMP is
contained in TPROUT.SMP.
