Commercial rights may be purchased by sending $10 to the above address for
each machine in which this program is used.

     In this program (Y/N) Means you should respond with a 'Y' or 'N'.

**************************** SPECIFICATIONS **********************


1) Sorts by any column either numerically of alphabetically.

2) Searchs for up to 10 items on any column or columns.  Allows operators of or,
and, <>(less than and greater than, and not.  The results of this search can be 
sent to cassette, printer, disc, lcd, crt, and RS232.

3) Prints data in columns, on address labels,  postcards or any size paper (with
return address) or a single variable on a line.

4) Allows math with a single operator between columns (+,-,*,/).  Also totals 
each column.  The results of this are printed in an additional column.

5) Allows additional printing options such as single field per line, skipping 
lines between records, printing of only selected fields, multiple copies, and 
batch sort and printing.

6) Allows from 1 to 16 fields of data.


     Prior to running this program a data file with certain information must be 
in memory.   This data may be entered from the text editor as described below or
you may run 'INIT.BA' (The first program on the tape) and generate the file from
the questions asked.  This file then becomes your source file and should be 
saved to tape or disc before it is cleared from memory.  Another program which 
is included is POSTCD.BA, which will print a message on a 4 x 6 inch postcard.  
Addresses and return address may be printed using Database.

***************************** INITILIZATION ************************

     The first four lines of the file will not be sorted, and will always be the
first four lines.  They must contain certain data as described below.  Before 
running this program go to the text editor and enter these four lines of data.

1) The first line of the file contains headings of the fields (columns) that you
will be using.  You are allowed up to 16 columns with a maximum of 255 
characters minus the number of fields.  Separate each column heading with a 
comma.
     The printed width of each field is determined by the first line of the file
(the heading).  Spaces may be added after the field heading to provide extra 
space for data. Ex 'name     ' or to center it '----name----'  . Spaces to the 
left of the heading  cannot be used to center it and they will be ignored (Ex. '
     Name    ' will come out as 'Name    '.
If data in a column is wider than the column the extra data will be printed in 
the next line and in the correct column area. 

2) On the second line of the file enter the math operators +,-,/,* Or N for none
(any other characters not an operator will be ignored during calculations).  
The equation that will be used during math enabled printing will consist of:
Intial Constant, col zero operator, col zero value, col one operator, col one 
value, etc.  
Try entering some operators and observe the results during formatted printing.  
At the end of the printing the operators will be printed after the totals.  If 
you re-enter this after it has been enabled it will simply disable and return to
print menu.
Example:  With math operators of +,-,*, initial constant of 5 and a data line of
2,3,4 the equation would be 5+2-3*4=16.  Calculations are done in order of 
occurence.

     This second line can also be used for the return address to be printed on a
postcard.  They must be in the same respective columns as the other address 
information.

3) On line three enter the title that you wish printed at the top of each page. 
Place commas after the title to supply the same number of fields as the heading.
  Important - every line in the file must have the same number of commas.  Ex.  
  'Personal Telephone List,,' would be used for three columns.

4) On line four enter the initial constant (see math section below) and the 
apporpriate number of commas.  An example file is shown below:

Description,Price each ,quantity ,units (Column headings)
n,+,*,n                                 (Column math operators)
Material Cost,,,                        (Title of file)
1.1,,,                                  (Initial constant)
nails, 1.45,10,Lbs                      (Data from here on)
flat headed screws,12.45,5,100's


     Another sample file is shown below:

Name          ,Address         ,Telephone #,City    State   Zip
me,here,555-1212,Richmond Va 23235
Mailing Address List,,,
0,,,
John Smith.,555-1234,101 1st Street,Anytown Va 22222 

     No blank lines are allowed within the file and each line must contain the 
same number of fields(ie commas) as the heading.  After entering the heading 
additional data may be entered from the text editor, however it is easier and 
more accurate to enter it from within the program.  The file must be edited from
the text editor.  Deletions and corrections are not allowed within the program.

     Data may be longer than the heading and still be properly printed on the 
next line during formatted printing.

     Now run the program.

     Database and the year will appear on the screen.  If this is not the 
present year then change line 9010 to the correct year.  If you don't then the 
wrong year will be printed on your documents.  This corrects the random year 
changing problem with the Model 100.

     Input question "File?      .do"
enter the filename but not ".do".

     Input question "About how many records are to added?"
This tells the program how much space to allow for additional records (a record 
is one complete line of data, such as "description, price each, quantity, and 
units".
     The program will now count the number of records in the file and then move 
the array to the data.

**************************** Print Menu ***************************

This Is the main menu of the program (there are four others)

The first line indicates the number of records at present,  the number of 
fields, and the maximum number of records that the array A(c,cc) is dimensioned 
for.  You may not have more than this number of records in the file without 
restarting the program.



1) Sort - Can sort by any column either numerically or alphabetically.  If a 
numerical sort is selected and alpha data is encountered this data will be given
considered to have a value of zero for sorting purposes.
     Sort will simply sort the file.  From then on all printouts will be sorted 
although the data in the source file will not actually be moved.

     Sort & Print will sort by a column, print the results and do the same for 
any other selected columns.  Be sure to select the printer with F2 before 
printing starts if you want data sent there.  You will notice the words over the
  functions keys.  These select the device to which the results of all printing,
searching, sorting, etc. will be sent.

2) Search - Allows searches on up to 10 items in the same or different columns. 
It also allows 'OR','AND', 'NOT' or "<>" selection.

     If 'OR' is selected then a record printing will occur if any item within a 
field is encountered. 

     If 'AND' is selected then all items must be encountered within a record for
it to be printed.

     If 'NOT' is selected then if selected items are encountered within the 
selected field of a record that record will not be printed, while other records 
will.

Example: If you search for "up" and the field contains "supper" it will be 
considered found.  An example search entry is shown.  Note:  0,END will not be 
searched for.  Also  both strings must be in the same case i.e. 'up' and 'UP' 
will not match.

0,Bob
1,street
2,city
0,END (must be capitol letters

     If '<>" is selected then you will enter a range of values to look for.
Only one search will be done and the search will be an alphabetical search.

3) Format printing - Data will be sent to print file (p$).  The print file can 
be changed using keys F1-F8 at any time they are displayed.  Columns will be 
lined up and math will be performed if enabled.  Print using is used during this
section to create evenly spaced columns.
If data is sent to the cassette or disk using this section or search it will not
be formatted but appear exactly as formatted in the data file.  The file may 
then be loaded into memory using text, and a subset of the original file will be
obtained.  Hold 'E' to terminate the listing prior to normal ending.  You may 
have to hold it for several seconds.

Note: Data cannot be sent to another ram file using this or unformated printing 

4) Options- this selects another menu. See explanation below.

*********************** Option Menu *******************

1) Title printed? Selects if title with time, date, headings, page number, etc 
will be printed. 'Y' indicates printed and 'N' indicates not printed. This 
toggles when you enter 1.

2) Lines skipped ,underlining - Select number of lines to be skipped between 
records during formatted printing, and underlining between records.  Multiple 
lines skipped and underlining together will give multiple underlining.

3) Form feed - Toggles form feed at end of last page printed.

4) 1 Field/line - allows each field to be printed on a separate line. Toggle.
Ex John Smith
   101 1st Street
   555-1234
   Anytown Va. 22222

5) Lines/page - select number of lines per page. You may change default in 
program line 9024. Normally 66.

6) # Of copies - Select number of copies to be printed during formatted 
printing, searching and sorting.

7) Free memory and field size - give free variable space, free string space, 
width of each field, and total width used.

8) Postcard - Prints addresses from file and return address from line two of 
file.  You may select the fields that you want printed.  Enter 'Y' or 'N'.  The 
program is setup for 4 x 6 inch postcards with 24 lines of print on each.  It 
can also print the same data on any length page (24 and 66 are standard lengths)
.  The return address data must be in the same columns respectively as the other
address data.

9) Adrs. Labels - sets up appropriate status to allow printing of one column.
of addresses on 3 3/4 by 7/8 inch address labels (available at Radio
Shack). 

0) Print menu - Return to print menu

************ Return to Print Menu Descriptions *************

5 100 Menu - Goes to model 100 menu.  Be careful, you will not loose data but it
does take time to restart the program.

6) Prt setups - Another menu. See following descriptions.

********************* Prt Setups **********************

0) Print menu - Return to main menu

1) Spaces between fields - Allows you to have any number of spaces between 
fields during formatted printing.

2) Printer setup - allows you to send codes to your printer.  Simply enter the 
decimal codes that change your printer fonts and operation.  Press 'ENTER' 
between codes and enter '0' as your last.

Example: If chr$(29) Setups your printer for condensed print enter '29' 'enter' 
'0' 'enter' and 'chr$(29)' Will be sent to your printer.  You may send multiple 
codes, just press enter between each one and enter '0' as your last entry.

3) Fields printed - You may select to print only certain fields.  Enter 'Y' if 
you want a field printed and 'N' if you don't.

4) CRT: Width - sets width of CRT (40 or 80).  Use only if you have the disc 
drive.  This section also allows you to select the screen (0/1) lcd or crt.


************ Return to Print Menu Descriptions *************

7) Math enabled - Allows calculation between columns.  This Section allows you 
enable and disable the math operation (+,-,*,/,n(none)) entered in line two of 
the file.  The equation consist of :
Intial Constant, col zero operator, col zero value, col one operator, col one 
value, etc.  
Try entering some operators and observe the results during formatted printing.  
At the end of the printing the operators will be printed after the totals.  If 
you re-enter this section after it has been enabled it will simply disable and 
return to print menu.
Example:  With math operators of +,-,*, initial constant of 5 and a data line of
2,3,4 the equation would be 5+2-3*4=16.  Calculations are done in order of 
occurence.

8) Enter data - Enter more data to array.  You will be prompted with the heading
of each column and the previous record.  You will also see a block graphics 
character which indicates the end of column.  You may enter data past this point
but it will be printed on the next line during formatted printing.  If there is 
no change in that field from the previous entry then press enter.  After each 
record is entered data will be automatically added to the text file.  You will 
be given a chance to change the record after you have entered all its fields.  
The maximum length of a record is 255 characters minus the number of fields.

9) Unformatted print - This will send data exactly as it appears in the text 
file.  It also faster than the formatted printing.  This section will also work 
on the printer and LCD but data is not formatted neatly.

F1-F8 Funtion keys - These keys select where data is sent during formatted and 
unformatted printing.  They may be pressed anytime they are visible and the 
device will be selected, however the reverse video may not change until printing
starts.  Data sent to disc or cassette will always be unformatted to minimize 
storage space.  The resulting file may then be entered into ram and accessed by 
database.


********************** ERROR HANDLING **********************

     If a program error is encountered an alarm will be setoff.  You may recover
from this error generally by pressing enter.  This is not a guaranteed recovery.


If a source file format error is encountered the line number in the source file 
in which the error occurs is given and after you press enter the line the error 
occurs in will be printed.  It is possible that the error is on the preceding 
line or following line, so check these if you cannot find the error.  Remember 
all lines in the file must have the same number of commas and must be 254 or 
fewer characters long.
