     BASIC CURVE FITTING PROGRAM FOR THE MODELS 100/200

=================================================================

    This program reads in column organized data from a .DO file, and
generates a least sqaures curve fit to the data. Available fits 
include linear, inverse, exponential, power, and 1st to 4th order 
polynomials. Data output is in the form of the coefficients, printer
tabulated output, or screen plot.

=================================================================

INPUT FORM:

    The input file must be a numeric file, consisting of columns of 
numbers separated by commas. The lines must be less than 256 
characters, and terminated with a CR.

EXECUTION:

    The program, once entered is function key driven. Upon initial 
entry an automatic call to F1 is made. The actions taken for each 
key hit are described below.

F1-"File"

    Lists out the current files in memory, asks which file you wish 
to use, and which columns in that file to use. Then goes to F2.

F2-"Equa"

    Asks for the equation type to be used to fit the curve. Just hit
the number corresponding to the equation desired. If polynomail fit 
is chosen, you will be prompted for the order. Then goes to F3.

F3-"Coef"

    Lists out the coefficients for the equation selected. Hit any 
key to continue.

F4-"Val"

    Allows you to input an X value, and will find the Y using the 
last equation fit to the curve. Hit ENTER without any data to exit 
this option.

F5-"Tabl"

    Prints a data table on the printer consisting of file name, 
date, equation type, coefficients, and for each raw data point, X, 
Y, Y' (fit curve), and the deviation (Y-Y').

F6-"Pscr"

    Plots a graph of the raw data and the fitted curve to the 
screen. No axis or labels. Hit any key to continue after curve is 
drawn.

F8-"Exit"

    Returns to the main menu.
