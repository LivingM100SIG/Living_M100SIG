	This supplemental documentation points out differences in the improved 
version of LOADER.MPC called LOADR1.MPC.  read LOADER.DOC so that this makes 
sense.  Only changes are discussed herein.

	LOADR1.MPC is extensively rewritten to provide more safety, as much 
automation as I could think of and supports the use of Keith Bergeroff's 
UNBREAKABLE M/L password program PSWDM.100 (DL4).  I wrestled with it for a 
long time trying to figure out a way to use it without interference from either
TMPC and/or CDOS; and, while trying to check my own work after uploading 
LOADER.MPC, had a flash of inspiration.  LOADR1.MPC is the result.

	To maximize use of password protection and automatic features, install 
TMPC and associated programs in Bank1 if using 64K RAM.  That way, password 
locking of Bank 1 locks the entire computer since you must go through Bank 1 to
get to the others.  Also, CDOS is watched for and automatically killed if TMPC 
or PW are accessed.

Function keys are redefined as follows (based on LOADER.DOC):

F1 - Phn#:  No change

F2 - ClrM:  Automatically clears HIMEM no matter what is in it.

F3 - Srch:  No change

F4 - TMPC:  Loads/Runs TMPC after clearing/saving anything else in HIMEM

F5 - Appt:  No change

F6 - Lock:  Loads/Runs PW, the M/L password program after clearing/saving 
anything else in HIMEM

F7 - Bank:  No change

F8 - Exit:  returns to the M100 menu after clearing/saving anything in HIMEM.

	Hope to hear from other TMPC users with even better ideas!!!
