TYMKPR.100 is a program designed to record computer use time by "ACCOUNTS" or 
categories.  Its complimentary program, TYMRTR.100 prints a formatted statement
of individual entries and keeps a running tally of computer time for each 
account for the year.  It was written to help document the percentage of 
personal computer cost which can be used for a business tax deduction.

The program is set up for six different accounts, although a greater or lesser 
number can be used to fit your requirements.  TYMKPR.BA is designed to 
"permanently" reside in RAM.  The program is only 294 BYTES, but TYMFIL.DO, the file it creates can be considerably longer.

To use:

a.  SAVE TYMKPR.BA to RAM.

b.  Goto MENU.  Place the cursor over TEXT and <ENTER>.  Type TYMFIL at the 
"File to Edit?" prompt.  Goto MENU.

c.  Place the cursor over TYMKPR.BA and <ENTER>.  The screen will go blank.

d.  To activate the program throw the ON OFF switch to <OFF>, then to <ON>.  The date and a time will appear on the screen along with your list of accounts,
and the prompt "SELECT ACCOUNT:".

e.  Type in the NUMBER of the appropriate account then <ENTER>.  The screen will clear and the menu will appear.

f.  You may now access any file or function you wish, however we should examine
what has taken place.

Enter TYMFIL.DO .  You will notice two lines.  The first contains the date, a 
time and "EXIT".  The second line is similar except the time should be
different (later) and a number replaces "EXIT".

The first line was created when you first entered the program.  In all 
subsequent entries this type of line signals the completion of an operating 
period.  This first line is not used, and will destroy the listings generated
by TYMRTR.100 .


At this time you may

                 ERASE THE FIRST LINE ONLY.
                 ============================

You should now have one line remaining.  The last number in the line is the 
account number you entered.

TYMKPR.100 uses the <POWER OFF,RESUME> command available in Model 100 Basic. 
On power up TYMKPR.100 starts running in the middle of the program (the program
ends with <MENU>).

g.  When finished working (nobody actually plays) with the Model 100,
TYMKPR.100 should be reset.  To reset the program goto MENU.  Place the cursor over TYMKPR.BA and <ENTER>.  A new "EXIT" line will be PRINTed to TYMFIL.DO,
and the screen will clear again.  The computer is now OFF.  There is no need to switch the computer to <OFF>, but you may if you wish.

Each entry set (2 lines) requires 45 bytes of RAM for storage.  If the computer
is used frequently for short intervals TYMFIL.DO can use up the available RAM 
quickly.  When TYMFIL.DO becomes so large that it limits the programming 
capability of the Model 100, TYMFIL.DO should be SAVEd and reopened.

TYMFIL.DO can be SAVEd to CASsette like any other TEXT file or can be processed
and printed out as a statement using TYMRTR.100 .

                        *** BEFORE USING TYMRTR.100 ***

                 SAVE TYMFIL.DO TO CASsette or RAM for INSURANCE!
                =====================================================

TYMRTR.100 automatically converts the data in TYMFIL.DO to a cumulative listing
by account.  The original data in TYMFIL.DO is erased and replaced by the 
cumulative data.  If you desire to store the original data for future reference
TYMFIL.DO MUST BE SAVEd BEFORE RUNNING TYMRTR.100 .

TYMRTR.100 can be run ONLY ONCE for each original data set.  To run multiple 
copies of the TYMRTR.100 statement the original data must be LOADed back into 
TYMFIL.DO.

TYMRTR.100 is approximately 3000 BYTES with the remarks removed.  It can be 
SAVEd to a CASsette file until you are ready to print a statement.  TYMRTR.100 
is not an interactive program.  After loading all the user must do is place the
printer on line and run the program.

The program is written in Model 100 basic and uses standard ASCII graphic 
commands. The original program was written to run on a Mannesmann Tally
MT-160L.

Lines 100, 109, 119, 339, 415, 440, and 471 contain print format commands.  
These lines are remarked so you can embed codes for your printer.  You should 
also be able to run the program with the lines deleted although you may lose 
something in appearance.

TYMRTR.100 converts the individual entries in TYMFIL.DO into hours and minutes 
and lists them in columns by account.  The print out is formatted for six 
accounts.  The second account is one space wider than the others.  I use this 
column for work related computing time.  It should handle an accumulated total 
of 9999 hours.

Line 450 erases the original entries in TYMFIL.DO and replaces them with the 
cumulative totals for each account.  The totals print out as " YR to DATE " in 
the last line of the listing and as "PREVIOUS" in the first line of the listing
the next time the program is run.


                                LIMITATIONS

In order for TYMKPR.100 to work you should end each session by going to MENU
and running TYMKPR.BA .  If the computer is switched off manually the "EXIT" line in TYMFIL.DO will not be recorded and the files will be out of sequence
after that point.  The automatic POWER down has the same effect. (If anyone
knows of a machine language command to goto a specific address before POWER OFF
I'd appreciate hearing from you.)  If the computer is switched <ON> then <OFF> 
without entering an account number and <ENTER> the computer will jump to MENU
on the next power up.

The IPL or POWER OFF commands cannot be used when this program is running.


                                TROUBLESHOOTING

Every problem I have encountered with TYMKPR.100 and TYMRTR.100 can be traced
to an error in TYMFIL.DO .  The problem that shows up most frequently is a 
statement containing repeated "PREVIOUS" statements.  This indicates an out of 
sequence file.  It can be caused by any of the above mentioned reasons.

TYMRTR.100 uses "EXIT" as a test.  If "EXIT" is not the sixth (or a multiple of
the sixth) data element the program reverts to the "PREVIOUS" routine.

I have found it best to enter TYMFIL.DO while in the text mode occassionaly to 
make sure that every other entry ends with "EXIT".  Fortunately data files can 
be edited like any other text file on the Model 100.  If the wrong account is 
entered, or if you forgot to run TYMKPR.BA after a programming session data 
files can be written in manually, changed or deleted.

Another problem which may show up is a date with no time listing.  This is 
caused by an "account" entry outside the parameters of the program.  If you are
prone to this kind of error add the following line to TYMKPR.100:

        35 IFA$<>"1"AND<>"2"AND<>"3"AND<>"4"AND<>"5"AND<>
"6"THENCLS:PRINT@133,"INVALID ENTRY":FORX=1TO500:NEXTX:GOTO30

As mentioned earlier you can run TYMRTR.100 only once for each set of original 
data.  Running the program a second time will print a "PREVIOUS" row followed
by an identical " YR to Date " row.


The two programs discussed add a little more professionalism to your Executive 
Work Station, and they may keep Uncle Sam off your case when you try to deduct 
your Model 100 as a business expense next April!
