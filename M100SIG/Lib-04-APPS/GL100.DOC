GL100.BAS is the report writing program for GL100. It prints the Income 
Statement and Balance Sheet.

To run your reports you have to have first closed out your period end using 
GLPOST.BAS. Do not close the year before running reports.

Once you've closed the period your WTB.DO file will have all the information 
needed for the reports. CJ.DO doesn't have to be on your computer during report
printing. Only GL100.

All you have to do is pick the report: Income Statement and Balance Sheet. Turn
on the printer (there is no prompt - just do it), and answer two questions. 
Company Name and Date(s). For the income statement, dates should be the 
beginning and ending dates of the period closed (not the entire year), e.g. 
"December 1 to December 31 1987". The balance sheet should be just the closing 
date, "December 31 1987". Unfortunately commas have to be ommitted because 
BASIC is wierd.

The reason is that an Income Statement reflects activity over a period of time,

and a Balance Sheet shows a condition at one point in time. If that doesn't 
make sense, go read an accounting text. If that sounds too boring (which it is)
, just take my word and do it this way.

If you are using GL100 in a non-business environment and don't use a double 
entry system (in other words, just an expense sorter for your household), then 
don't print the balance sheet. See GLDOC for details.

That's all there is to it. But make sure you do your file management carefully,
and read GLDOC on managing the entire system.

REVISION OF 2/21/87:

Two items have been changed.
1) A bug in handling prior period info has been corrected.

2) You no longer have to enter Company Name on every print out. Just set up 
your first account in WTB.DO as acct. #

000,Company Name, 0  0  0  0  0 

and it will pop into place.

The next revision of GLPOST will add the save feature to Working Trial Balance 
printout.
