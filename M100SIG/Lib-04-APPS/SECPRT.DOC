		SECurities PoRTfolio
	
(c) 1984 by Michael A. Lampert	
	
	I. Intoduction
	
	SECPRT is a program that records your open securities positions, 
figures your gains or losses based on prices input from keyboard, a ram file, 
or through the modem (direct connect or acoustic cup). It also keeps track of 
closed security positions and historic gains and losses as at whatever periods 
you use the program.
	Before the first run, edit line 250 to substitute your password for the
word PASSWORD near the end of the line. Also edit line 260 so PH$= your local 
Telenet number in place of 5551212 (leave the "+ PH$" after the number.)
	On the first run do *not* answer the first two questions yes, and do *
not* use the Historic data part of the program: they malfunction on the first 
use (but are fine thereafter). The program creates a file (ram or cassette, 
your choice) called STKLST which keeps your portfolio and liquidated and 
historic data in compressed form. If you use the modem, a file called QUOTE 
will also be created.
	
	II. Input
	
	The program opens with a copyright notice. Then the screen clears and 
asks if you want input by tape, and if not, input from ram. The input referred 
to is a record of prior transactions, so on first use answer both "N". (The 
program uses inkey$ here, so no <enter> needed). In the future, depending on 
where you've stored old data, answer one "Y". If tape, ready the recorder and 
hit <C>, as the program instructions.
	The program will read (from tape or ram) the number of data items, then
announce itself as it reads unliquidated, liquidated and historic data.
	When done, it will beep and announce "standby to check input". 
Liquidated and unliqudated transactions will scroll by, stopping every so 
often. (Long security names will be displayed truncated to fit the available 
screen space, and not all of the data stored for each entry will be displayed. 
This scroll, used frequently in the program, puts titles on the screen bottom, 
which is scroll protected. If you ever break the program with this line frozen,
punch the "LABEL" key twice and all will be right.)
	The screen will go black and an input menu appear.
	Choice 1 will prompt you to add a security by first asking for its 
name.(This part of the program requires the use of <enter> to terminate each 
entry.) The name should be in the form:
	TICKER SYMBOL-Readable name
For example:
	T-ATT
	CMIBJ-ChaseMan.Puts/9/$50.
	If the ticker is not the first few characters followed by a dash, (
except for "other securities" described in the next paragraph), the modem 
aspects won't work. The program won't error trap this, but it will a security 
name > 20 letters.
	Next it will ask if the position is long or short. Then you will type a
number to reflect (1)NYSE, (2)ASE, (3)OTC, (4)Options, (5)Bonds or (6)Other 
Securities. Any security for which Dow Jones News Retieval does not list a 
price should be called an other security.
	Then you will report the purchase price. For stocks, use the price per 
share; for options, per 100; for bonds, all in cents. After answering this 
question the new stock will be inserted in its alphabetic place in its exchange
listing, then the list of all open securities will scroll, then the program 
returns to the input menu.
	Choice 2 on the input menu is change a security. The open securities 
will scroll past, and you will be asked which number to change. Then you will 
go through the same prompts as choice 1 , and also asked for a purchase date 
which must be in the form MM/DD/YY where YY>=82 and <= current year. The 
program will not realphabetize or change exchange after this activity, so if 
the change you need to make requires this, delete the old entry (see below) and
add a new one. Again, after changing a security the open securities scroll, and
then you return to the input menu.
	Choice 3 liquidates (sells) a security. The open positions will scroll,
you choose the number of the position to close, and the total proceeds. Both 
open and liquidated positions scroll past, so you can confirm the deletion from
open and addition to closed lists. The program automatically computes gains or 
losses.
	Choice 4 deletes entirely the security whose number you type after 
seeing the list. The deletion is confirmed by the new list scrolling.
	Choice 5, value the portfolio, leads to a new menu for inputing prices.

	The price by menu lets you choose from (1) keyboard, (2)acoustic cups, 
(3) modem or (4) QUOTE.DO.
	Choice 1, keyboard, will list a number, the truncated security name, 
the number of units, the purchase price and will prompt with a question mark (
and a footer that says "CUR.PR." in reverse video.) Be sure to format the price
in the same dollars and cents format used for the purchase price displayed just
to the left of your input, or the program will GIGO.
	Choice 2 will notify you it's doing a forced trash collection and then 
prompt you to dial the phone and press enter. Thereafter it behaves like choice
3.
	Choice 3 does the trash collection, then dials telenet. For both 
choices 2 and 3 you will see a Telenet Dow Jones sign on, then "starting 
quotes". Each security, preceded by its DJ punctuation (comma, semi, dash, 
slash) will appear on the screen. If more than 30 seconds elapse with no new 
ticker symbol appearing, type <shift-break> and after the Ok prompt, type 
"NEXT:CONT" and the next ticker will appear. If this happens, there will be an 
error later in the program. When finished the program will say "signing off."
	Choices 2, 3 and 4 all now lead to "Digesting Quotes". If there is an 
error, the program will report it and stop. (If during download you had to 
break, there will almost certainly be an error.) Go to Quote.do, find the 
error, fix the entry to parallel the others, and rerun the program choosing 
"QUOTE.DO" as the source of prices. If there are no problems, the program will 
prompt you to enter from the keyboard the prices of other securities, if any.
	The screen will clear and I'M CALCULATING will appear. Then the screen 
will black out and an output menu appear.
	
	III. Output
	
	Choice 1 produces a truncated report of unliquidated and liquidated 
transactions on the screen, using the usual scroll and a "hit enter to 
continue" between unliquidated and liquidated. When concluded, you return to 
the output menu.
	Choice 2 produces a fuller listing on printer after prompting you for 
whether you want liquidated detail. (When you have many liquidated transactions
accumulated, you'll appreciate why, sometimes, you don't want to see all closed
transactions). There is a printer ready/busy INP test in line 700. After 
printing you're returned to the output menu.
	Choice 3 will save to a cassette file, after prompting you to ready the
cassette and type <c>. 
	Choice 4 will save to a ram file. Both choices 3 and for will report 
what they are saving. **NOTE: Usually you should visit choice 5 before saving**
. The ram and cassette files are interchangable: if you save to ram, you can go
into the .DO file, save it to tape and use that as a cassette file; and you can
use the cassette file to Load a .DO file. When your portfolio gets big, late in
the year, you may not have enough ram space to save to ram. When done saving to
either, the program will beep and return to the output menu.
	Choice 5 will add this session's unliquidated and liquidated profits 
and losses to an historic file. USE IT OFTEN. When you pick 5, you will be 
asked if today is a week-ending day, then returned to the output menu.
	Do not choose choice 6 till you have two or three weeks of data. What 
happens when you do choose it will be discussed in a moment.
	Choice 7 will end the program with a "STOP" if, and only if, you've 
saved data to ram or cassette, else it will curse at you and take you back to 
the output menu.
	Choice 6 leads to an inkey choice of (T)able, (G)raph or (R)eturn to 
output menu. The last choice is obvious. The Table choice will lead to (S)creen
or (P)rinter to route output; the Graph choice always goes to printer. Either 
choice leads to Weekend Only, with a Y or N answer. A table of session or 
weekly summaries of liquidated, unliqudated and total gains or losses will 
appear. Again 1060 has a printer ready test, which will be triggered if you try
to use the type ahead buffer to choose both a printed graph and table. When 
done, you are returned to the Table, Graph, Return line.
	
	IV. Misc.
	
	A. The program uses Dow Jones & not Compuserve for the quotes because 
DJ is cheaper.
	B. DJ just announced a format change in certain quotes. I've inquired 
and do *not* believe it will foul things up, but if  /CQE becomes the default 
instead of /CQ, the program may foul.
	C. Compuserve has announced a new quotes base in decimal instead of 
eigths. When implemented, it may make more sense (in code savings) than the 
higher cost.
	D. The liquidated history excludes dates of purchase and sale. They 
could be added easily, but you still couldn't use this for Schedule D because 
of the new IRS rules about shifting commissions.
	E. If you break but stay in basic, GOTO 30 at the command level will 
take you to the INPUT MENU; GOTO 600 to the OUTPUT MENU.
	
	I've used the program (originally in shorter form on a Model III) for 
two years. If it causes you problems, please let me know.
