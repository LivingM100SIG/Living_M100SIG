GLWTB is a small program for writing a chart of accounts for use with the GL100
accounting program.

In order to use any sorting program to develop accounting records you must 
first have a chart of accounts. This program allows you to enter account titles
and numbers in the format used by the GLCHEK program and other GL100 programs 
for sorting and reporting. 

You are presented with two screens. One invites you to either make another 
entry, or stop. The other is an input screen. Where you input a number and 
account title. You can also enter an ending balance. The ending balance should 
be last year's balance, not an earlier period of this year which should be 
entered with a journal entry.
 
Once the information is entered the program sorts sorts it in case you didn't 
enter it in numerical order. 

After exiting you will see a file called WTB.DO which stands for Working Trial 
Balance. You will see that in addition to the number and title there are five 
numeric fields which are used for accumulating the working information for 
reports.

Once you understand the format used you can just use the M100 text editor and 
throw away this silly program. Just make sure you keep everything in numerical 
order.
The following ranges are necessary for use with GL100:
   100-149 Current Assets
   150-199 Other Assets
   300-349 Current Liabilities
   350-399 Long Term Liabilities
   400-499 Equity
   500-599 Income
   800-899 Expenses

Also, two specific account number/titles are required:
   104 Cash In Bank
   410 Retained Earnings

The mysterious missing ranges are reserved for future purposes, that I might 
add if I feel like it. If you prefer different ranges, feel free, but you'll 
have to changes the report programs that use them, though it shouldn't be too 
hard.

Definitions (for those who need them)

Current Assets: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory,Pre-paid Expenses, Short 
term investments. Any asset readily convertible to cash or likely to become 
cash in the short term, meaning less than a year.

Other Assets: Long Term Investments, Notes Receivable (long term promisory 
notes, not accounts receivable), Property and Equipment, Building, Land. Any 
asset that won't become cash for at least a year.

Current Liabilities: Accounts Payable, Short term Notes Payable, Refundable 
Deposits owed. Any debt or liability due within the year.

Long Term Liabilities: Just what's implied, mortgages, bonds and the like.

Equity: Stock, or Ownership interest, plus retained earnings.

Expenses & Income: Pretty obvious.

One more note: If you need or like more accounts you can use longer number or 
sub-accounts i.e.: 10600 or 106.00 Cash in CD's. The accounts are treated as 
strings, not numbers.

Any questions, drop me a note.
