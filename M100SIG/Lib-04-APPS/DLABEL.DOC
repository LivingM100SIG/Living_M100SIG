
                           DOCUMENTATION FOR DLABEL 

  Works as is with DBASE.100 

  To use as a label printing program without DBASE.100 - just enter - 

  Name, Company, City, State, ZIP or whatever. 

  Just  remember the 'fields' are seperated with a < comma > no EXTRA spaces 
  needed 

  Name = 1 field   Company = 1 field  etc... 

  Adjust characters across per labels across printed. 

                      Hope you can use.
