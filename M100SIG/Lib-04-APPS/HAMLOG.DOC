	CQ to all those hams and SWL'ers who use their Tandy Model 100s, 102s, and 200s to do their logging.
	HAMLOG.100 AND HAMLOG.200 are designed to give the logger a quick way to get the job done _ especially during a hot and heavy contest like the CQ Worldwide Phone Contest.
	The logger can make his or her first entry by pressing F1 key.
	The word "DATA" will appear on the screen. Just start typing in your log entry in any form you choose.

	I use this form:
	
	22:30	JT1AB	5-3	14.195	ASSAB (His name)

	You can type to the end of your screen and onto the next line. But don't go too far onto the second line.

	If you want to add more comments to the QSO logged, hit F2 and the word ""NOTES"" will pop up. Again, type in the added data

	Be sure to hit ENTER after you finishing typing your information. Each time you hit ENTER, the entry for "DATA" or "NOTES" will be added to ""LOG.DO"

	You can enter "LOG.DO" without leaving the HAMLOG program.
	Press F3 and you will be at the top of your log. While there, you can use the "Search" command on your Model 100, 102, or 200 to find dupe contacts or other information.
	During a contest, you won't have to wonder if you worked JT1AB before (How can anyone forget working rare Mongolia?). You can use the EDIT function and make sure you didn't work JT1AB and never leave the logging program.
	While you are in the EDIT function, you can return to the HAMLOG menu by pressing the F8 key.

	On both versions of the program the time in GMT is given. But there is a catch. You have to change the setting yourself, according to your time zone.

	The following table will help you make the changes:


	GMT BY U.S. TIME ZONES

	EASTERN STANDARD PLUS 5
	EASTERN DAYLIGHT PLUS 4

	CENTRAL STANDARD PLUS 6
	CENTRAL DAYLIGHT PLUS 5

	MOUNTAIN STANDARD PLUS 7
	MOUNTAIN DAYLIGHT PLUS 6

	PACIFIC STANDARD PLUS 8
	PACIFIC DAYLIGHT PLUS 7


	The changes can be made in lines 500 and 510 of both programs. 
	For example, if you are living in Santa Ana, CA., and are on Pacific Daylight Time make Line 500 read "A+7" and Line 510 read "A-7"
	I have it set for Eastern Daylight Time.

	The TIME changes can be made by pressing F4

	Pressing F5 will allow you to rename "LOG.DO" for storage on disk or tape. If there is no ""LOG.DO" on you memu, the programs will automatically put it there.

	F6 returns you to the Main MENU.

	Good DX'ing from
