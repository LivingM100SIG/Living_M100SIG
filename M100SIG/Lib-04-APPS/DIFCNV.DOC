This is a program to convert comma delimited .DO files to DIF format files.  I 
wrote it in order to be able to insert data from other sources, such as 
downloaded data, into Lucid spreadsheets.  Lucid has utilities to convert to 
comma delimited, but not back.  It will go back and forth using DIF files, 
however.  
When the program runs, it asks for the input, comma delimited file and an 
output file name.  Note that the Lucid utility expects the DIF file name to be 
"DIF.DO".  The size of matrix and the individual statements are echoed to the 
screen while the program works.
