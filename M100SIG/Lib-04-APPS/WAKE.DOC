 At the First prompt type the time you want to wake. (ie. 06:30:00 ).
 When it reaches the time you set the clock for it will play some simple music 
to get you up but, if that doesn't get you up I guarantee the BEEP noise will!! 
To stop the beeping and the program just press a "S" (CAPITAL!!). But, to turn 
on the snooze alarm press any key (except "S"!). The snooze alarm is 
approximently 4 minutes.

   Includes:

  1. 4 min. snooze alarm.

  2. Graphics

  3. Good alarm (guaranteed to get u up!)

   Comments welcome.

   Enjoy........
