SPADAS and SPADASII, each written as stand-alone
programs, have been integrated to use the same program
in order to generate a complete accident report.



                      NOTE TO USERS

There are currently different versions of the SPADAS
developed programs.  There is a RAM-resident version and
a ROM-resident version.  The ROM version allows more
room for RAM report storage and contains more features
which are unchangeable by the user.  The RAM version has
less available space for report storage.  The features
are similar and, additionally, allows the user to change
(customize) the data information in the program.

The program's development is an on-going process and
some of the following information may not function as
described or may function in a slightly different
manner.


The DIAGRAMING portion of the program is described in a
separate supplemental document fulling detailing its
operation and use.




             ST PETERSBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT

INTRODUCTION

For several years, the St. Petersburg Police Department
has been using portable lap-top computers to gather data
and generate police reports.  Use of these computers has
resulted in more complete reports and more thorough
investigations.

The SPADAS project extended the scope of the use of the
portable computer to include the gathering of data and
the generation of motor vehicle accident reports.

SPADASII carries the process one step farther,
generating accident diagrams from data provided in the
accident report. This documentation addresses the
integration of both programs into one application.

The project effectively replaces the following forms
currently in use:

      HSMV 90003 (REV. 1/86)S Formerly FHP 3
      HSMV 90004 (REV. 1/86)S Formerly FHP 3A
      HSMV 90005 (REV. 3/86)S

and effectively gathers the information required on the
following form:

      HSMV 90006 (REV. 1/86)S




























BASIC OVERVIEW

SPADAS.BA (hereafter referred to as the "program") has
many features built into its user interface.  The
program generates "modules" of information selected from
a main Caption Checklist.  These modules are assembled
in a logical and compelling order to make a complete
report.

A "free-text" narrative section is added to the end of
the assembled modules using the Model 100/102's built in
TEXT editor.

Using data entered in the DIAGRAM module, the program
then constructs an intersection (within constraints
defined by the physical size of the viewing area and
limited memory) and allows either freehand drawing or
the insertion of icons representing motor vehicles.

The completed report can then be transferred to another
computer via modem or direct-connect serial interface,
or directed to a printer where the report and diagram
are printed out.

As you will see, the input into each module is carefully
controlled and validated.  Many entries are controlled
by forced choice tables which contain suggested and/or
suitable responses for a data request.  The initial
choice presented to the user is also controlled, making
a common entry easy and efficient to input. The table is
easily modified by the user in RAM versions of the
program..

The user is informed, via messages displayed at a
consistent location, as to the type of input that is
appropriate.  After the entry, the response is
validated.  Many operations are completed with a single
keystroke.

Some responses are calculated by the program, as in the
age of a person being computed from the date of birth
provided by the user.  Other frequently used information
is maintained in an ASCII file (AGENCY.DO), read by the
program, and displayed as a possible response.  A single
keystroke accepts this response or allows the user to
enter another response.  The program is designed to be
both easy to use and attentive to the need to gather and
maintain data with a high degree of integrity.








FILE MANAGEMENT SCREEN

The user should have the SPADAS.BA program and the
AGENCY.DO program available for loading into the
computer.  Because of the different programs, loading
the program will depend upon the version you have
available.  Follow the instructions in the appropriate
manuals to load the program and file from either
cassette tape or disk.  Users with the ROM version
should follow instructions supplied with that version.

Once the program and file have been loaded into the
computer, run the program named SPADAS.BA.  The user is
then presented with a screen similar to the one
displayed below.

The upper right corner entry indicates the amount of RAM
memory currently available to the user.  This screen
indicates which files have already been created
(identified by the .DO extension), and the program
currently in use (identified by the *).  At this point,
the user has the opportunity to perform any of the
operations referenced by the function keys.

The reports generated by the program are identified by a
single alpha character, i.e., A through Z.  The document
AGENCY.DO contains information about the program user
which is read into the report when appropriate.  This
file MUST be present in the proper format. The bottom
"command line" is in reverse video.

The following section describes the different operations
of the function keys.










FUNCTION KEY OPERATIONS:

NAME [F1] ---- Presents the user with a list of files
similar to the file management screen and asks for a
file name.  Note the command line, which says (File
Name?  A-Z).  Entering a single alpha character will
open that file (i.e., name the report) and proceed to
the module menu screen.  NOTE: You can also enter an
alpha character directly, instead of depressing [1] and
accomplish the same result, i.e., open a file and
proceed to the module menu screen.

TEXT [F2] ---- Presents the user again with a list of
files similar to the file management screen.  In the
upper left corner is a prompt which asks "File to edit?"
and the command line tells the user what to do.  Type
the name of the file (without the .DO extension) that
you wish to edit and press <ENTER>.  This action will
exit the program and go to the top of the file you
entered.  For your convenience, pressing <CTRL><Down
Arrow> or <CTRL><Z> will then place you at the end of
the file.  The user can then enter text (for example, to
add a narrative to a report) using the TEXT processing
capabilities of the Model 100/102.

COPY [F3] ---- Presents a list of files and prompts the
user for a file to copy FROM.  A file MUST be present
from which to copy.  Once selected, the user is prompted
for the file to copy TO.  If not present, the file will
be created.  If the file is present, the file will be
appended to.  This function can be very useful in
certain situations.

SEND [F4] ---- Presents a list of files and prompts the
user for a file to send.  A single alpha character entry
selects the file, which will then be "sent" out the RS-
232C port of the computer.  The current parameters are
set at 87E1D (9600 baud, 7 bits, Even parity, 1 Stop Bit
and XON/XOFF disabled).

FREE [F5] ---- Presents the user with a list of files
similar to the file management screen.  The command line
says (Erase A-Z).  Entering a single alpha character
will ERASE (or "KILL") the file from memory.  Use this
function only when you want to remove the file from the
computer.  You CANNOT retrieve the file once it is
"killed".  You will then return to the File Management
Screen.  If a diagram is associated with the report
(denoted with an asterisk after the letter, i.e.,
A*.DO), BOTH files will be deleted with a single
keystroke.  If you need to delete either one of the two
related files (NOT BOTH), you must go into BASIC and
type the command KILL "filename.ext".



DRAW [F6] ---- this operation allows the user to print a
diagram.  The user is first presented with a list of
files and is prompted with the file to print.  The
DIAGRAM files are indicated by an asterisk after the
alpha character.  A printer should be attached to the
computer and loaded with paper.  A single alpha
keystroke will select the "car" file and initiate the
drawing of the diagram.

LIST [F7] ---- presents a list of files and prompts the
user for a file to print.  A single alpha character
entry selects the file, which will be sent to a printer
connected to the PRINTER port.  The output is formatted
for a better printed result.  The headings and prompts
are printed in boldface type and the leading line
numbers are omitted.

NOTE: The LIST function currently supports a printer in
IBM mode set to 10 CPI in non-proportional print.  Any
problems with the output of the LIST function may be
caused by improper switch settings or printer
incompatibility.  A common error can be easily corrected
by simply restarting the printer.  Until a problem can
be corrected, the file can be printed from the document
itself.  The DIAGRAM portion of the report cannot be
printed from the document and requires a specific
printing routine generated by the program.

QUIT [F8] ---- this function appears when Name, Text,
Copy, Send, Free, Draw  or List are selected.  Pressing
this key allows the user to cancel the selected function
and return to the previous menu.

EXIT [F8] ---- Pressing this function key will exit the
program and return you to the main menu.





















MODULE SELECTION

Once a document is selected, the program presents a
Caption Checklist screen as shown below:

       ษออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออป
       บ[File F]    Caption Checklist      9326 บ

         [F1] [F2] [F3] [F4] [F5] [F6] [F7] [F8]

The entry in the upper left corner of the screen, File
F, indicates the open document, i.e., the report being
written (F).  The check list presents "modules"
available to the user to build reports. The command
line, a familiar and valuable link between the user and
the program, is again in reverse video at the bottom of
the screen.  Note that a reverse video "bar" covers one
of the 12 listed captions on the screen.

The function keys listed on the command line operate as
previously described.

The highlight can be moved by one of three methods:

          1. Spacebar (forward) or BKSP (backwards)
          2. Entering the FIRST ALPHA CHARACTER of the
             caption
          3. Entering the caption's NUMERIC indicator

          Note the "wrapping" feature of the movements.
          The user never finds himself at a "dead end".
          Also, if two captions share an alpha or
          numeric character (in the case of Vehicle-
          Violation or 1-10), the program will advance
          to the first and then to the next entry when
          the same key is again pressed.  Note again the
          wrapping feature and the single-keystroke
          entry by the user in the last two methods.

The modules listed in this version of the program are
the modules necessary to complete a Florida Traffic
Accident Report.  Screens, forced choice tables, and
prompts can easily be "customized" for individual needs
in the RAM version of the program.





ACCIDENT and UPDATE are headings for the report, be it
an original or a follow-up (Update) report.  The
CLOSING module ends the report with the user's name and
other identifying information taken from the AGENCY.DO
file.  The actual modules listed in the Caption
Checklist have been adapted to the specific reporting
requirements of the Bureau of Public Safety Management.

The following discussion of the program's handling of
a module is representative of the handling of any of the
modules selected by the user.  Although the number of
screens and types of prompts may vary from one module to
the next, the basic handling of the screens is similar.

The order in which modules are presented on the screen
implies an order in which they should be completed,
however, the individual user can complete them in any
order desired. An ACCIDENT caption (#1) is typically
entered before a VEHICLE or other caption.

The DIAGRAM module is typically the final caption
entered in a report, especially since data gathered in
other modules is required in the construction of a
diagram (If this data is not available, the user is
presented with a blank diagraming area and allowed to
create the diagram "freehand").  The modules can be
repeated as often as necessary before adding the next
module.  Certain modules allow the user to repeat it
without printing another heading to the file.  This will
occur in modules 5, 6, 9 and 10.  If a reported accident
involves several vehicles or numerous people, each
person is identified in a separate module according to
his or her involvement.

There are many benefits to this type of data entry.
Information can be quickly located within any module
within any printed report.  Since the information is
highly structured, data can be extracted for use within
related information processing systems.  Responses are
uniform.  The novice or unfamiliar user can complete a
detailed report with little difficulty.  The familiar
user (at one time the "novice"), can utilize the many
"short-cuts" and single keystrokes to complete the same
complex report in a more timely manner.

Let's now see how a module operates within the
program...









MODULE SCREEN DISPLAY

The following is the first screen presented when the
ACCIDENT caption is selected from the Caption Checklist:

       ษออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออป

The bracketed word in the upper left corner of the
screen is the module which the user selected.  The entry
"Report" in the center of the upper line identifies this
screen and often gives further information about the
type of entries within the screen.  This is called the
"screen title".  The two numbers in the upper right
corner indicate that this is the first (01) screen of a
total of seven (7) screens in this module.

The area between the top and bottom lines (five lines on
this screen with a maximum of six on any one screen) is
the data entry area.  The display to the left of the
colon (:) is the prompt for the entry.  To the right of
the colon, the user types in his response, or accepts a
default answer (if presented) with a single keystroke.

Note that upon first viewing this screen, a single
reverse video block is covering the first position of
the first entry.  This is the first entry to be dealt
with by the user and is referred to as the "cursor
position".  The familiar reverse video command line is
again present.  The center entry in the line is the
user's "window" to the program.  This area either tells
the user what the program is doing or informs the user
of the type of input the program expects.

The command line has also changed in that it now
displays different functions associated with some of the
function [F?] keys.  Explanations of the functions of
these keys will be presented later in this
documentation.








MODULE DATA ENTRY

Here again is the first screen of the ACCIDENT module:

       ษออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออป

         [F1] [F2] [F3] [F4] [F5] [F6] [F7] [F8]

Three of the four entries are already present.  These
entries were read by the program from the AGENCY.DO file
and entered into the screen on the correct data line,
waiting to be accepted or changed by the user.  The user
did not have to manually enter this data but does have
to press the <ENTER> key to accept it.

The first entry (HSMV) is a (Numeric Fill) field,
indicating that all spaces must be filled with numeric
characters only. This entry is the Highway Safety Motor
Vehicle accident report number.

The next entry on this screen is for the Number, the
local agency report number.  It can also be filled with
numeric characters.  It does not HAVE to be filled, as
the previous entry did, and any unused digits will be
filled with zeros to the left of the number entered.

The third field (Prefix) asks for a report number
prefix, the two character agency prefix followed by a
two digit year.  The default that is presented was read
in from AGENCY.DO. The program will accept, as indicated
by the command line, any alphanumeric characters.

The fourth prompt is the Agency.  The command line
indicates that the appropriate entry for this line is
(Alphanumeric), indicating that a mixture of alphabetic
and numeric characters will be accepted.  Depressing
<ENTER> will accept this entry and move on to the next
data entry.  If for some reason this is not the desired
entry, the first alphabetic or numeric key pressed by
the user will delete the entry and present a line
indicating how many characters will be accepted.  Upon
filling the spaces, the command line will display
(ENTER), indicating it is ready to accept the line
entry.  No additional characters will be accepted and
any attempts to enter additional characters will be
answered with a BEEP.


The final entry on the screen is for the NCIC ID.  This
is the unique ORI number assigned to each agency.  This
number has also been stored and obtained from the
AGENCY.DO file.

When the last field is completed and the <ENTER> key is
pressed, the program will ask (Correct? Y/N).  If all
the entries on the screen are satisfactorily completed,
the user need only press the "Y" key or the <ENTER> key.
The information from this screen is then appended to the
file that was opened at the beginning of the session. If
one or more of the entries on the screen is
unacceptable, striking the "N" key will start the
process again from the first field on the screen.
Pressing any key other than "Y", "N", or <ENTER> will be
ignored.

When the screen is accepted and the information written
to the file, the program automatically presents the next
screen of information associated with the chosen module.
A screen similar to the one below will be presented.

The upper left corner of the screen indicates that this
screen is part of the ACCIDENT module. The upper right
corner shows that this is the second of seven screens.

The user will note a slight difference in the appearance
of this screen from the previous screen.  In addition to
the bottom command line appearing in reverse video, the
data entry area of the first prompt is also displayed in
reverse video.  This indicates that this is a "forced
choice" field.  This information is also provided in the
command line, which indicates that this is choice two of
eight possible choices (seven days of the week plus
"UNK").  The program defaults to the current day of the
week as taken from the system maintained day, date, time
functions.

If the day displayed is the appropriate one, the user
need only press the <ENTER> key to accept that answer.
If the displayed day is not the appropriate one, the
selection can be changed in a number of ways.


Pressing the spacebar displays the next day, as arranged
in the forced choice table associated with this screen.
The days can be arranged in any order, but in this
program they are in sequential order. Pressing the BKSP
(backspace) key displays the previous choice in the
table.  Pressing any alpha key causes the program to
search for the first occurrence of that key in the first
letter of the words in the table.  If the pressed key is
not present in any of the words in the table, no change
is made in the displayed answer.  The command line,
however, does display (Searching) to indicate that
a process is being performed.  If the pressed key is
found in the table, the word associated with the key is
displayed on the highlighted line.  The command line
also reflects the relative number of that choice.  When
the correct answer is displayed, pressing the <ENTER>
key accepts that choice and advances to the next field.

The handling of a FORCED CHOICE TABLE is similar
throughout the program.  The method of moving about
within a table and selecting a choice is the same.  If
the user selects OTHER (present in many forced choice
tables) and presses <ENTER>, the field is cleared and
filled with underscores.  This permits the user to type
in his own entry in alphanumeric characters.  This is to
allow for the many instances where it may not be
possible for the user to anticipate all possible
choices, or restrictions imposed by limited memory
precludes using an extensive forced choice table.

The next field is for a date. The program displays the
current date, again from the system maintained
functions.  This date can be accepted with the <ENTER>
key or changed by entering valid numeric characters in
the format listed on the command line.  After the
<ENTER> key is pressed, the program verifies the entry,
rejecting any entry where there are too many days in the
month or too many months in the year.

The next field is for the time of the accident.  The
command line indicates the format for the entry.  Four
numbers must be entered followed by a space and then
either AM or PM.  The "twelve-hour" time format is
required.  For example, if the accident occurred at 1030
hours military time, the correct entry would be 1030 AM.
If the accident occurred at 1545 hours military time,
the correct entry would be 0345 PM.

When all the fields on this screen have been filled, the
program again asks if the displayed data is correct. An
affirmative answer writes this data to the file and
presents the next screen, if there is one.




Having worked through the first two screens of the
ACCIDENT module, the basic concept of the program can,
hopefully, be understood.  To exhibit all screens of all
modules and explain each data entry field would be both
time-consuming and redundant.  Also note the additional
function key operations available while in the screen.
The following section explains the operation of these
keys.

As has been demonstrated, there are four primary sources
of data when completing a report: data from AGENCY.DO;
data from system maintained functions; data from forced
choice tables; and data from keyboard input.  Regardless
of the source of the data, the program validates the
data and accepts only data of the type defined for a
particular field.

After the completion of the last screen in a module, the
user returns to the Caption Checklist.  If the user
wishes to repeat a module, it is re-selected.  Certain
modules will ask the user if there is "Another? Y/N".
This allows the user to make additional entries without
returning to the Caption Checklist.  This type of
repetition also does not repeat the header of the module
in the file.  Suppose you encountered three passengers
in Vehicle One.  After the PASSENGER module was selected
and completed for the first time, the user would answer
"Y" to the "Another?" prompt.  The program returns to
the first screen of the PASSENGER module.  The module is
completed three times, at which time a "N" is entered at
the prompt and the user returns to the Caption
Checklist.  In the file, there would be a single
PASSENGER heading with three individuals listed as
passengers in Vehicle One.

The program keeps the user informed at all times.
Errors, if made by the user, are "trapped" and the user
can always continue.  Each screen of entries is reviewed
before being added to the stored report file.

















FUNCTION KEYS

From within a module screen:

[1] File - accepts the entire screen and writes it to
           the file.  Calling this function eliminates
           the needs to accept each field entry and then
           accept the screen.  This convenience is most
           noticed in the CLOSING module, as most of the
           information is obtained from the AGENCY.DO
           file.

[2] Back - returns to the previous screen without
           writing the current screen to the file.  No
           action is taken if the user is in the first
           screen of the module (except for a BEEP).

[7] Skip - goes to the next screen in the module without
           writing the current screen to the file.  No
           action is taken if the user is in the last
           screen of the module (except for a BEEP).

[8] Menu - returns the user to the Caption Check List
           without writing the current screen to the
           file.































SCREEN FUNCTIONS

Once you have successfully completed a screen and are
familiar with the basic concept of the program, you can
utilize other editing functions available to you.  All
of the function key operations and editing commands are
detailed in Appendices A-C.  Here is a sample of the
usage of a few of the more useful functions and
commands:

The File function [F1] from a screen enables you to
enter the entire screen without accepting each line and
then entering "Y" when asked if correct.  Pressing File
writes the ENTIRE screen to the file as it appears on
the screen.  For example, a more efficient way to enter
the first screen in the ACCIDENT module would have been
to press F2 after the first two questions had been
answered.

Each entry must be completed and cannot be bypassed by
pressing ENTER.  If the information is not available or
not required, pressing TAB will bypass the question but
place underscores in the document.  You cannot
accidentally skip a question; a "blank" answer, in
effect, is a response from you.

If you happen to have completed two of the four screens
in the first module (having written them to the
document) and are interrupted, you can enter Menu and
then Exit to exit the program.  When you are ready to
continue completing the report, you simply open the same
file, select the module you were completing and then
press GRPH 3 at the first screen.  This action takes you
directly to screen 3 of that module.  You could also
press Skip twice.  Pressing Skip or Back does NOT cause
the screen to be written to the file.

These examples illustrate some of the power of the
program.  Every effort has been made to make the program
efficient and easy to use.  By looking through the
appendices, you can easily get many ideas.  You should
try the many functions and commands to get familiar with
the power of the program.













COMPLETING AN ACCIDENT REPORT

Completing a Florida Traffic Accident Report is simply a
matter of assembling the modules in an ordered fashion
using as many (or as few) as needed.  All the modules
necessary to complete a report are included in the
program Caption Checklist.  All the information gathered
by completing the appropriate modules meets or exceeds
the data requirements of the Department of Highway
Safety and Motor Vehicles and the Bureau of Highway
Safety Management.

A typical accident report requires an ACCIDENT, FACTORS,
CLOSING and at least one VEHICLE module.  The inclusion
of other modules is dependent on their need.

A typical update report requires an UPDATE and CLOSING
module.  The inclusion of other modules, again, is
dependent on their need.

Narrative is added by using the TEXT processor included
with the Model 100\102 computer.  The narrative is added
below the NARRATIVE heading which follows the CLOSING
module.

A general outline for an accident report is as follows:

   ACCIDENT and FACTORS module
   VEHICLE module and associated modules
   PEDESTRIAN module if applicable
   Subsequent VEHICLE and associated modules
   PROPERTY module(s) if applicable
   WITNESS module(s) if applicable
   CLOSING module

   DIAGRAM module if appropriate




Following is a flow-type chart which outlines in a
visual manner the module choice selection process.














PRINTING THE REPORT


The portable computer has a "port" on the back of the
unit labelled PRINTER.  A cable attached to the printer
should have a plug which fits into this port. Carefully
plug the cable into the computer with the side labelled
TOP up.  The cable only fits one way and should not be
forced.  Forcing the cable may bend one or more of the
pins in the port.

Once the cable is connected, turn the printer on.


There are two methods of printing the reports:

FROM WITHIN THE PROGRAM...

While at the main menu of the program, select the List
function.  The program will prompt for a file name and,
once entered, will print the report.

The report will be printed without the line numbers and
the bracketed words (which modify, or explain, the
answer) will be printed in boldface type.

FROM WITHIN THE DOCUMENT...

Go into the document by placing the cursor bar over the
document at the MAIN MENU.  For example, move the cursor
bar over A.DO and press ENTER.  You will be at the top
of the file.  Press and hold down the SHIFT key and
press the small function key labelled PRINT.  A prompt
(Width:80) is printed in the lower left corner of the
screen.  Press ENTER and the file will be printed.


NOTE: The above described method of printing will NOT
work when printing a diagram.  Refer to the Diagraming
section for further information.

Further information and details on printer operation can
be found in the appropriate manuals.













FUNCTION KEYS

From File Management and Caption Checklist screens:

[1] Name - presents a list of files and prompts the user to
           create a file.  If the file already exists, it
           will open the file for further input.  When chosen
           from the Caption Check List screen, it allows the
           user to change reports.  The file in use is shown
           in the upper left corner of the Caption Check List
           screen.

[2] Text - presents a list of files and prompts the user for
           the file to edit.  The user must enter a single
           alpha character followed by <ENTER>.  Once
           selected, the user leaves the program and goes to
           the TOP of the report selected.  Entering <CTRL>
           DOWN ARROW or <CTRL> Z will take the user to the
           END of that file, ready to add text.

[4] Send - presents a list of files and prompts the user for
           a file to send.  A single alpha character entry
           selects the file, which will then be "sent" out
           the RS-232C port of the computer.  The current
           parameters are set at 87E1D (9600 baud, 7 bits,
           Even parity, 1 Stop Bit and XON/XOFF disabled).

[5] Free - presents a list of files and prompts for a file to
           erase.  A single alpha character entry selects the
           file and deletes it from memory.  The function is
           called through the program with the "Kill"
           command.

[7] Prnt - presents a list of files and prompts the user for
           a file to print.  A single alpha character entry
           selects the file, which will be sent to a printer
           connected to the PRINTER port.  The output is
           formatted for a better printed result.  The
           headings and prompts are printed in boldface type
           and the leading line numbers are omitted.

[8] Quit - this function appears when Name, Send, Free or
           Prnt are selected.  Pressing this key allows the
           user to cancel the selected function and return to
           the previous menu.

[8] Menu - returns to the MAIN MENU









FUNCTION KEY OPERATIONS:

NAME [F1] ---- Presents the user with a list of files similar
to the file management screen and asks for a file name.  Note
the command line, which says (File Name?  A-Z).  Entering a
single alpha character will open that file (i.e., name the
report) and proceed to the module menu screen.  NOTE: You can
also enter an alpha character directly, instead of depressing
[1] and accomplish the same result, i.e., open a file and
proceed to the module menu screen.

TEXT [F2] ---- Presents the user again with a list of files
similar to the file management screen.  In the upper left
corner is a prompt which asks "File to edit?" and the command
line tells the user what to do.  Type the name of the file
(without the .DO extension) that you wish to edit and press
<ENTER>.  This action will exit the program and go to the top
of the file you entered.  For your convenience, pressing
<CTRL><Down Arrow> or <CTRL><Z> will then place you at the
end of the file.  The user can then enter text (for example,
to add a narrative to a report) using the TEXT processing
capabilities of the Model 100/102.

COPY [F3] ---- Presents a list of files and prompts the user
for a file to copy FROM.  A file MUST be present from which
to copy.  Once selected, the user is prompted for the file to
copy TO.  If not present, the file will be created.  If the
file is present, the file will be appended to.  This function
can be very useful in certain situations.

SEND [F4] ---- Presents a list of files and prompts the user
for a file to send.  A single alpha character entry selects
the file, which will then be "sent" out the RS-232C port of
the computer.  The current parameters are set at 87E1D (9600
baud, 7 bits, Even parity, 1 Stop Bit and XON/XOFF disabled).

FREE [F5] ---- Presents the user with a list of files similar
to the file management screen.  The command line says (Erase
A-Z).  Entering a single alpha character will ERASE (or
"KILL") the file from memory.  Use this function only when
you want to remove the file from the computer.  You CANNOT
retrieve the file once it is "killed".  You will then return
to the File Management Screen.  If a diagram is associated
with the report (denoted with an asterisk after the letter,
i.e., A*.DO), BOTH files will be deleted with a single
keystroke.  If you need to delete either one of the two
related files (NOT BOTH), you must go into BASIC and type the
command KILL "filename.ext".


DRAW [F6] ---- this operation allows the user to print a
diagram.  The user is first presented with a list of files
and is prompted with the file to print.  The DIAGRAM files
are indicated by an asterisk after the alpha character.  A
printer should be attached to the computer and loaded with
paper.  A single alpha keystroke will select the "car" file
and initiate the drawing of the diagram.

LIST [F7] ---- presents a list of files and prompts the user
for a file to print.  A single alpha character entry selects
the file, which will be sent to a printer connected to the
PRINTER port.  The output is formatted for a better printed
result.  The headings and prompts are printed in boldface
type and the leading line numbers are omitted.

NOTE: The LIST function currently supports a printer in IBM
mode set to 10 CPI in non-proportional print.  Any problems
with the output of the LIST function may be caused by
improper switch settings or printer incompatibility.  A
common error can be easily corrected by simply restarting the
printer.  Until a problem can be corrected, the file can be
printed from the document itself.  The DIAGRAM portion of the
report cannot be printed from the document and requires a
specific printing routine generated by the program.

QUIT [F8] ---- this function appears when Name, Text, Copy,
Send, Free, Draw or List are selected.  Pressing this key
allows the user to cancel the selected function and return to
the previous menu.

EXIT [F8] ---- Pressing this function key will exit the
program and return you to the main menu.






























FUNCTION KEYS

From within a module screen:

[1] File - accepts the entire screen and writes it to the
           file.  Calling this function eliminates the needs
           to accept each field entry and then accept the
           screen.  This convenience is most noticed in the
           SIGNATURE module, as most of the information is
           obtained from the AGENCY.DO file.

[2] Back - returns to the previous screen without writing the
           current screen to the file.  No action is taken if
           the user is in the first screen of the module
           (except for a BEEP).

[7] Skip - goes to the next screen in the module without
           writing the current screen to the file.  No action
           is taken if the user is in the last screen of the
           module (except for a BEEP).

[8] Quit - returns the user to the Caption Checklist without
           writing the current screen to the file.

































EDIT COMMANDS

From within a module screen:

TAB key -  Depressing this key advances to the next field and
           displays a default answer obtained from AGENCY.DO,
           if any, in the by-passed field.  If there is no
           default answer, underscores are re-displayed.

DOWN ARROW - has the same effect as the TAB key except that
           it will not advance past the last field as will
           the TAB key.

UP ARROW - backs up to the previous field. Use of this key
           can be useful when it is necessary to correct a
           field without going through the entire screen.

Shift UP ARROW - backs up to the first field from any field
on the screen.

Shift DOWN ARROW - advances to the last field from any field.

Shift LEFT ARROW - same as FUNCTION KEY [1] - Back

Shift RIGHT ARROW - same as FUNCTION KEY [7] - Skip

CTRL LEFT ARROW - goes to the first screen in a module
           without writing the current screen to the file.

CTRL RIGHT ARROW - goes to the last screen in a module
           without writing the current screen to the file.

GRPH <0...9> - depressing the GRPH key followed by a number
           results in going directly to the screen of that
           number within the module (if it exists).  For
           example, depressing GRPH <4> will result in going
           to the fourth screen in a module with at least
           four screens.  Note: 0 goes to the tenth screen.
           This is useful in returning to a specific screen
           within a module when a previous report writing
           session had been interrupted.

ENTER -    accepts a default entry in a field

SPACEBAR - enters the system date or time in an appropriate
           field.  If this entry is incorrect, check the
           system date and time and change if necessary.

DEL -      forces a blank entry (fills the field length with
           underscores) in the field.

The AGENCY.DO file must be present in the above format to
correctly function within the program.  Each item in the
above left column must occupy its own line in the order
listed.

If AGENCY.DO is not present or in its proper format, the
program will not cease to execute.  It will cause the field
to be alphanumeric and fill it with empty spaces or whatever
is in its position in the file.  If the user notices an entry
is incorrect or empty, the field can be corrected from within
the screen.  The AGENCY.DO file should then be checked for
problems and edited when appropriate.
