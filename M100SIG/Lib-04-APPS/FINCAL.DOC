FINCAL.BA -- A simple financial calculator program for the M100/M102
--------------------------------------------------------------------

FINCAL is a financial calculator based on the well known five function
key program available on the HP-12C calculator. The program allows you
to supply three of the five following parameters, and calculate one of
others:

    N --  number of time periods, (and number of periods per year)
 I%Yr --  nominal annual interest rate
   PV --  present value
  PMT --  payment per period
   FV --  future value

It is a somewhat simplified version, only allowing the calculation of
either the PV, FV, or PMT, with the entry of N, I%, and at least one
other parameter.

The program is operated entirely by function keys, and the display shows
the current values set for each of the five parameters. In addition,
the entry of any parameter, a recalc warning appears in the display to
remind you that the values displayed do not show the result of a calc-
ulation yet. The recalc display disappears when a calculation is
performed.

The function keys are defined as follows:

F1 -- NPer    Allow entry of number of periods. Pressing this key
              causes a new function key menu to appear:

              F6 -- Entr   This key prompts for a value for number of
                           periods.

              F7 -- N/Yr   This key prompts for a value for number of
                           periods per year. (Default is 1).

F2 -- I%Yr    This key prompts for a value for the nominal annual
              interest rate, as a percent, e.g. 8 = 8.00%

F3 -- PV      Allows entry of, or calculation of the present value,
              based on current values of the other paramters. Pressing
              this key causes a new function key menu to appear:

              F6 -- Entr   This key prompts for a value for the present
                           value.

              F7 -- Calc   This key calculates the value of the present
                           value based on the current values of the
                           other parameters.

F4 -- PMT     Allows entry of, or calculation of the periodic payment,
              based on current values of the other paramters. Pressing
              this key causes a new function key menu to appear:

              F6 -- Entr   This key prompts for a value for the payment.

              F7 -- Calc   This key calculates the value of the payment
                           based on the current values of the other
                           parameters.

F5 -- PV      Allows entry of, or calculation of the future value,
              based on current values of the other paramters. Pressing
              this key causes a new function key menu to appear:

              F6 -- Entr   This key prompts for a value for the future
                           value.

              F7 -- Calc   This key calculates the value of the future
                           value based on the current values of the
                           other parameters.

F7 -- Clr     Clears all current values in display, and the relcalc
              warning.

F8 -- Exit    Terminates whatever is going on, and returns to the system
              menu.

The HP convention for cash flow signs is observed -- basically dollars
paid out are negative, and dollars you receive are positive.

No reasonability checking is performed to determine if you have entered
nonsensical values for interest rate, number of periods, etc, so doing
so will result in the program going berserk.

This program was constructed using the application template program,
SHELL.BA.
