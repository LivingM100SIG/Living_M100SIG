----------

If you happen to have a Model 100 and PCSG's Super ROM (I have version 1.8,
but any version with the data base feature should work), you have all you
need to start and maintain a data base of your SWL loggings.  To do this,
follow these steps:

1) Use TEXT to cut-and-paste the seven lines at the bottom of this document
(between the lines of ='s) into a file called SWLOG.DO.

2) Call up Super ROM, go into the Lucid spreadsheet module and create a new
spreadsheet called SWLOG (yes, the same name -- Super ROM assigns different
extensions so the two files won't conflict)

3) Once you have a blank spreadsheet on the screen, press F6 (Data), F1
(View), and enter SWLOG and press Enter.

You are now ready to begin entering your loggings. If you want to print
your loggings, you may want to go into the spreadsheet and adjust some column
widths, or use Super ROM's data base report feature. Column usage is as
noted in the data entry screen below (e.g., column A contains the date,
column D the frequency, etc.).  You can also sort your loggings by frequency,
date, signal strength, etc.

The fields and what they mean:

   DATE -- entered in YYMMDD format for
           correct sorting
   TIME -- two fields for beginning and
           ending times; UTC, of course
   FREQ -- kHz; enter a leading zero if
           frequency is less than 10000
           (e.g., 05630.0) for sorting
           purposes
   SIGNAL STRENGTH -- 0 to 10 or
           whatever your receiver is
           set up for; you have up to
           four digits
   QSL SENT -- date (YYMMDD)
   QSL REC'D -- date (YYMMDD)
   COUNTRY -- Be consistent when you
           enter these so sorting will
           be accurate
   STATION ID -- same comment as for
           COUNTRY
   NOTE (2 lines) -- for anything you
           want to put here

If you haven't heard of the Super ROM, it is a ROM chip produced by the
Personal Computer Support Group (11035 Harry Hines Blvd #207, Dallas TX 75229,
214/351-0564) which plugs into the back of your Model 100 (or 102) and gives
you four programs: text processor, spreadsheet, data base, and outliner.
If you need these four functions, it's invaluable. The cost is approximately
$199.
