          In the last two lesson, we have shown how to use the warehouse
          and the daily list, both of which are independent of time.  In
          the next two lessons, we will discuss time-related items.

          To clarify Lessons Three and Four, we define some terms below. It
          will help you to remember that we use these terms precisely.

                                     Definitions

          Appointment.   Any entry in the calendar section with a time
                         associated with it.  The first character of the
                         description must begin with a digit.

          Memo.          Any entry in the calendar section without a time
                         associated with it.  The first character of the
                         description must not begin with a digit.

          Item.          Either an appointment or a memo.

          Current date.  The date that will flash if you enter the calendar
                         screen.

          Today.         The day set by DATE$ in BASIC when you enter TMPC. 
                         TMPC does not change DATE$, and of course, it
                         might not really be "today", as in our example.

          Calendar day ("Cday").   One day on the calendar.

          Business day ("Bday").   Mondays through Fridays, excluding
                                   business holidays.


          We will structure our examples around five different "events" in
          Tom's workday.  Each event shows a different feature of the
          time-related section of TMPC.


                                Adding an Appointment

          Tom gets a telephone call from one of the company salesman. 
          There will be a meeting with Drynan to review the results of the
          lab program.  "Just a minute", Tom replies.  He enters TMPC.

                            Lesson 3: Time Related Items

          Tom presses [Right-Arrow] to move to the calendar screen.  He
          presses [Right-Arrow] again to activate the cursor arrows for the
          calendar.  "When is the meeting?" he asks.  Finding out that it
          is on the 23rd at 2:30 Pm, he presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow]
          [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] to move over the date.  Then, he
          presses [Enter] to deactivate the cursor arrows.  He presses
          [Down-Arrow] to see appointments and deadlines for the 23rd.

          In the first lesson, this screen showed Tom's appointments for
          the 11th, or "today".  However, the screen actually shows
          appointments for the current date, and the current date is set to
          today whenever you enter TMPC or return to the first two corridor
          screens.  As an exercise, you may want to try it now.  Move to
          the screen to the left of the appointment list; then move back.
          You will see today's appointments, instead of those for the 23rd;
          then, move to the calendar.  The calendar will show today's date
          again, not the 23rd.  Move the date back to the 23rd as before
          and continue with our example.

          "The 23rd is fine with me", Tom says, seeing the dearth of
          activity for that afternoon.  He exchanges a few remarks about
          the Drynan lab results with the salesman.  While doing so, he
          presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to select the
          item right before the position of the meeting:

          TMPC does not automatically sort appointments by time; you must
          put them int he right order.  This gives you flexibility to enter
          the times in any format you want.  Tom presses [Down-Arrow] to
          edit the appointment immediately before the addition:

          Then, he presses [Down-Arrow] to enter Text.  He adds the meeting

          After pressing [F8], he thinks it would be nice to have several
          days' warning of the upcoming meeting.  So, he presses
          [Right-Arrow] and [Down-Arrow] and enters the number "5" for the
          number of days warning.  After pressing [Enter], he presses
          [Right-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to make the warning for five business
          days:

          TMPC allows you to express warnings in terms of either Cdays or
          Bdays.  Five Bdays is usually a week, unless there are holidays
          involved.  To see the effect of the warning, move back to the
          calendar and set the date to January 16.  Check the appointments
          for that day, and you will see a deadline for the meeting,
          showing 5 Bdays left.

          Now that the meeting has been scheduled, Tom exits TMPC and
          continues with his business.

                            Lesson 3: Time Related Items

          Tom gets another call from a salesman.  "Synquil just called", he
          says. "They want to reschedule the meeting next Wednesday from 10
          to 2:30". Tom enters TMPC and moves directly to the appointment
          list by pressing [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow].  He selects the
          Synquil meeting:



                                      Screen 6

                      ** **0                                  



          Then he presses [Down-Arrow] to edit the appointment:



                                      Screen 9
                      ** *************************01/18/84****
                      ** *10 Synquil Presentation         ****
                      ** *                                ****

          You will notice that the date changed from "today" to the date of
          the Synquil meeting.  This is what happens whenever you select a
          deadline and edit it: The date changes to the deadline date.  Tom
          realized this; he used it as a shortcut to move to next week.
          Before changing the time of the appointment, he presses
          [Up-Arrow] to see if there are any afternoon appointments.

          "Just fine", he says, since 2:30 is free.  He presses
          [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to enter TEXT and changes the "10 to
          "2 1/2".  He presses [F8], then presses [Up-Arrow] to see if the
          order is OK:
