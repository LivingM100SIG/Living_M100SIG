        TVTIME v.4

INSTRUCTIONS:

    This program is meant for fast, accurate notes of live events or tapes
that will automatically include a time-stamp...either time-of-day, a count 
from zero or matched to a tape.  It also allows one to set 4 keys to print in
often used phrases with one key-stroke (e.g. "Question:" "Answer:" "Joe Smith",
 etc.)  

  To use simply run the program and begin to type your notes.  As you type,
 a separate text file will be created with your notes and the times.  Each 
time you hit ENTER, one note stops and the new time will be entered at the 
beginning of the next note.

  If you type a note longer than one screen, the program will automatically 
clear and give you a new screen.  The notes will appear in the file without 
a break.

  If you hit ENTER to START a note, the program will time the duration until 
the next ENTER and add that to the text file...this allows you to rough time 
a sound bite on the fly.

  If you want to RESET the clock, hit F2 and enter the correct time or whatever
time matches the tape or your timecode generator.

  If you want to RESET to ZERO, hit F1 and answer the question "Y".

  If you want to STOP the clock when you stop a tape that you are screening,
 hit F5.  This will pause the clock until you hit ENTER (when you restart 
the tape).

  To change the FAST KEYS, hit F6.  Then ENTER, change the text string WITHIN 
the quotes, hit F8 and F4 to restart the program.

  To change the name of the file you are printing to, hit F7.  Then ENTER,
 change the name following "RAM:" WITHOUT erasing the quotes, hit F8 and
 F4.

   This program is very short (lines 0 thru 9 can be eliminated after your
conscience is satisfied) and allows you to use almost the entire memory--which
helps on long hearings.  It was field-tested on the Iran-Contra hearings.  I
 can also write you a very fast patch to alter it for your particular uses...
