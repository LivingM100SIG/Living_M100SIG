 POLAR PROTUCTS'
  TEMPERATURE VISUAL program for M-100
      including 30 year normative data
      and sample data set for
      Philadelphia, PA
       (normative data for each of over 200 other major metropolitan regions 
could be generated from NCDC/NOAA data (see below) and substituting every-third
-day temperatures for the high-low data of the lines of line 93 and the mean 
data of lines of line 97.)

Instructions for TEMPERATURE VISUAL

1.  Load TEMP.DO (sample data set) or create file TEMP.DO and enter 1 1 90 10. 
(Once you begin entering your data, those numbers could be deleted.)
2.  Create TEMP.BA by
 (a) Downloading TEMPR.100 to your new
      file named TEMPR.DO,
 (b) going to lines 303-306 and,
      pretending you see the following
      patterns
  
          pqqqqrH       ......H    
         Mu    uM      M.    .M    
          vqqqqwL       ......L    ,
  
   replace each  .   v  u  p  q  r  w
 with <SHIFT><GRPH>  m  ;  u  p  o  . ,
  
 (c) deleting the words before line #1,
 (d) going from the MENU to BASIC,
 (e) typing -- MERGE "TEMPR.DO"<ENTER>,
 (f) typing --   SAVE "TEMP.BA"<ENTER>.
 (g) If you are not using an M100 with
     32K RAM, MERGE the following:
 
 3030 '
 3031 OPEN"C(@)&#.DO"FOR OUTPUT AS 1:? #1,CS:CLOSE:CLEAR
 3032 OPEN"C(@)&#.DO"FOR INPUT AS #1: INPUT#1,CS:CLOSE:GOSUB3034
 3034 KILL"C(@)&#.DO":GOSUB12: H=.1:L=.1:AY=1:RH=1:GOTO 15
 
3.  Delete LINE 2 after running TEMPERATURE VISUAL.
4.  Turning the M-100 off and on during TEMP.BA and using the Redraw function 
permits different visualizations of your data.

          The normative data in this program was generated from National 
Climatic Data Center/NOAA calculations.
Normative data for your region could be obtained from the NCDC for $2.00 + 
$5.00 S&H by telephoning 704-259-0682 and requesting Daily Normals, No. 84.
