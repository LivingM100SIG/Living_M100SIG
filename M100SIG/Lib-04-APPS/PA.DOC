CALC
    CALC IS A SIMPLE CALCULATOR THAT ADDS, SUBTRACTS, MULTIPLIES, AND DIVIDES
 IN THREE FORMATS: NORMAL NUMBERS, MONEY, AND TIME.
   THE F-KEYS ARE PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY.  YOU CAN ENTER TIME AS
 "HH:MM:SS" OR "MSS" OR "SS" OR "S" FOR CONVENIENT ENTERING OF MOST TIMES THAT
 TV PEOPLE USE.

TVTM
  TVTIME III IS MY NOTING PROGRAM THAT AUTOMATICALLY WRITES IN THE TIME-OF-DAY
ALONG WITH YOUR NOTES.  TO WRITE, SIMPLY START TYPING, IF YOU HIT ENTER FIRST,
 IT WILL TIME THE NOTE FROM ENTER TO ENTER.  IT WRITES A FILE CALLED "LOG.DO"
 AND THAT NAME CAN BE CHANGED BY HITTING F7
OTHER F-KEYS ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE THE INTERNAL CLOCK TO MATCH THE CAMERA OR
TO COUNT FROM ZERO.

EXPN
  THE EXPENSES PROGRAM STORES AND SORTS ONE WEEK OF EXPENSES AND BREAKS THEM
OUT IN THE ABC NEWS FORMAT WHICH IS PRETTY USEFUL FOR ANY OTHER COMPANY.
EDIT LINE 442 TO ADD YOUR NAME.

SCPT
  SCRIPT IS A PROGRAM THAT SCREENS A TEXT FILE AND GIVES YOU A TIME 
ACCORDING TO YOUR PERSONAL SPEED (FROM 1 TO 10...MY SPEED BEING 5).  IT THEN 
WILL DUMP YOU TO CALC TO ADD IN SOUNDBITES IF DESIRED.

S&R
  SEARCH AND REPLACE ALLOWS YOU TO ALTER A TEXT FILE FAST.  IT TAKES A SERIES 
OF TEXT STRINGS AND REPLACES THEM, EITHER ALL AT ONCE OR ONE AT A TIME,
GIVING YOU THE OPTION.

PRNT
   PRNT IS A SIMPLE AND SHORT PRINT FORMATTER THAT TAKES A SCRIPT WRITTEN
IN TEXT AND PRINTS IT OUT WITH VIDEO CUES (WRITE THEM WITHIN BRACKETS--
GRPH+9, GRPH+0 AT THE BEGINNING OR END OF SENTENCES) ON THE LEFT AND THE 
TEXT IN 40 COLUMNS ON THE RIGHT.
  I'M STILL WORKING ON THIS ONE.

WTCH
  THIS IS A STOPWATCH THAT USES THE INTERNAL CLOCK.  IT DOES LAP TIMES 
AND ALLOWS ONE TO ADD SELECTED TIMES TO A TOTAL TIME (TO TIME A SCRIPT, FOR
INSTANCE AND IGNORE BAD TAKES).  IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO DUMP THE TOTAL INTO 
CALC FOR ADDING SOUNDBITE TIMES.

   IT'S A SIMPLE SERIES OF PROGRAMS AND CAN BE ALTERED TO YOUR PERSONAL 
PREFERENCE.  JUST EDIT AND REMOVE THE "ONKEYGOSUB" COMMANDS ON LINE 4 AND 
THE UNNECCESSARY LINES THEY REFER TO.

   SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOME.  IT RUNS ABOUT 8.5K BUT I FIGURE THAT 20K IS
ENOUGH TO FUNCTION.
       TERRY
