--------------------------------------
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THE ST PETERSBURG
POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN USING THE
TANDY MODEL 100/102 TO GATHER DATA AND
GENERATE REPORTS.  USE OF THESE
COMPUTERS HAS RESULTED IN MORE COMPLETE
REPORTS AND MORE THOROUGH
INVESTIGATIONS.

THE SPADAS PROJECT (St Petersburg
Accident Data Acceleration System)
EXTENDED THE SCOPE OF THE USE OF THE
PORTABLE COMPUTER TO INCLUDE THE
GATHERING OF DATA AND THE GENERATION OF
MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT REPORTS.

SPADASII CARRIES THE PROCESS ONE STEP
FURTHER, GENERATING ACCIDENT DIAGRAMS
FROM DATA PROVIDED IN THE ACCIDENT
REPORT.

THE OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN
DERIVED FROM THE FLORIDA HIGHWAY SAFETY
FORMS PRESENTLY IN USE THROUGHOUT THE
STATE.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE AND
RELATED PROJECTS CAN BE OBTAINED BY
WRITING TO THE ADDRESS LISTED ABOVE IN
