DOCUMATION FOR TODO.PJP
By Phil Pearsall [70476,1476] 10/16/84

INTRODUCTION:

TODO is a Reminder-Clock-Alarm-Calendar-Calculator program that has been 
bouncing around in my Model 100 for most of a year developing.  It started out 
as CLKCAL.100 by Jim Frerris 70506,1102 who, according to the rem's in the 
begining of the downloaded program, derived it from APOINT.220 by Richard Ross 
and CLKDAT.101 by Howard J Bender 70235,1337.  Along the way I also picked up 
ABACUS.100 by Dave Mack 71256,44.  The rest is mine except for a short 
capitalization routine that I "borrowed" from RFU by Jesse Bob Overholt as 
published in "Portable 100".


DESCRIPTION:

TODO lets you input appointments and ToDo's to NOTE.DO.  It then displays 
today's appointments and all ToDo's (up to six lines) in a window on the 
display. In another window the day, date, time, and alarm time are displayed.  
By means of function keys you can:

        F1. View and Delete appointments and ToDo's
        F2. Enter Appointments or ToDo's
        F3. Retrieve phone numbers from ADRS.DO
        F4. Set or Cancel alarm time
        F5. Run ABACUS (calculator)
        F6. View the perpetul calendar
        F7. Redraw display windows on power up.
        F8. Return to M100 menu


OPERATION:

1) Files:

ALARM.DO with at least one entry must exist in RAM for the program to run. A 
single character or your name or whatever will suffice for the single entry.  
You can later delete it after an alarm time is entered.  The program will open 
a NOTE.DO file if none exists.  To use the phone directory routine, ADRS.DO 
must be in RAM (more on this later).  Using NOTE.DO and ADRS.DO allows one to 
use the M100's ADDRSS and SCHEDL routines when TODO is not loaded and with 
phone numbers in ADRS.DO, TELCOM with auto-dialing can be used.

2) Display:

The opening display is a window on the left side of the screen for displaying 
appointments and To-Do's and a smaller window on the right displaying the day, 
date, 12 hour clock time, and a small window for alarm time.  Without any data 
in NOTE.DO the Appointment & To-Do's Window is empty as is the alarm mini-
window without an alarm time loaded.  Under the windows the function keys are 
labeled "view entr phon alrm calc caln reln menu".

3) Function Keys:

        F1 (view) allows viewing of appointments and To-Dos one at a time with 
the option to delete.  Pressing F1 calls up a window that lets you select 1) 
Scan, 2) MM/DD, 3) Today, or 4) TO-DO.  1) lets you scan all entries in the 
file, 2) lets you select a date then view appointments for that date, 3) calls 
up todays appointments, while 4) calls up TO-DOs.  As you view each entry you 
have the option to delete it.

        F2 (entr) lets you enter appointments and To-Dos.  You first are asked 
to select <T>oDo or <A>ppointment.  Upon selection of either, a heading will 
appear to guide the entry.  An entry can be up to 254 characters long but only 
23 characters (to the end of the screen) will be displayed in the Appointment 
and ToDo window.  After typing an entry, hit ENTER and you will be asked if you
want to make another entry.  Hit any key but "Y" and the program sorts the new 
entry into the file.  Appointments are sorted ahead of ToDos in chronological 
order and Todos are sorted alphabetically by the first five characters in the 
entry with upper case ahead of lower case.

        F3 (phon)  Now is a good time to talk about organization of the ADRS.DO
file.  First of all, I don't have addresses in this file only phone numbers.  
Each entry consists of name, home no., and work no. and should be spaced 
exactly as follows to match the display headings in TODO:
                    BOBBI ARCHAMBAULT 700-6000 :900-4000:
For longer names, shorten.  For shorter names, fill in with spaces.  The ":" 
enclose the number you might want to auto-dial.  Names must be in caps because 
TODO capitalizes the keyboard input before looking for a match.  Thus, during 
operation one does not have to worry about how the name appears in the file or 
if CAPS LOCK is on or off.  This is the most recent addition to TODO and, as 
mentioned in the introduction, is "borrowed" from RFU by Jesse Bob Overholt as 
published in "Portable 100".  CIS and BBS numbers with auto-logon sequences are
also in my ADRS.DO file.  These entries are indented eight spaces so that when 
the file is sorted on the last name they are sorted to the top after which they
are treated as header when using HDSORT.100.  That is if you sort the ADRS.DO 
file.

        Back to F3 (phon)  Pressing F3 displays a window that asks for a name. 
First, last or any part of a name can be entered in lowercase,uppercase or any 
combination and all matches will be displayed.  When you type in the wrong name
or want to make a second call you can look up another number by hitting "Y" in 
response to the "Another No?" Question.

        F4 (alrm) results in a window and the menu <S>et or <C>ancel.  Pressing
<S> leads to another menu <D>aily or <S>ingle.  Pressing <D>, in turn, lets you
enter an alarm time.  The entry should be 24 hour time in the form HH:MM.  This
entry will cause the alarm to sound every 24 hours at the inputed time.  
Selecting <S> on this menu lets you input a date and time.  This input should 
be in the form MM/DD  HH:MM and will result in the alarm sounding once at that 
date and time.   Selecting <C>ancel lets you view each entry in the ALARM.DO 
file with a cancel option.
Note:  In the top display each alarm time is displayed for one second each pass
through the file.  This is by design so that one has time to read the times, 
but it, also lets you cause the alarm time to flash by selecting <D>aily and 
entering spaces for the time after an alarm time has been entered.

        F5 (calc) selects ABACUS, a friendly easy to use Calculator without any
reverse polish arithmetic or other tricks required.  One caution though, 
selecting the ABACUS to PRINTER option without a printer connected or turned on
will result in the M100 hanging up until either the printer is connected and 
turned on or SHIFT-BREAK.

        F6 (caln) selects a perpetual calendar.  The opening display shows the 
current month, with today's date hi-lighted, in one window and the day, date, 
time, alarm time displayed in another window.  Function keys (F4-F7) allow 
display of next mo., previous mo., any month, from the year 100 to I don't know
how far into the future (don't know about the accuracy at the extremes), and 
today.  F8 returns you to the main program.  The first three 'F' keys are not 
used because for some months (Sept. and Dec. 84) some dates fall outside of the
window and overwrite the ledgend for the first couple of keys.

        F7 (reln)  Until I find something else for this function, it is used to
RUN after powering up with the program loaded, to redraw the windows.

        F8 (menu)  Returns to the Model 100 Menu.


Notes:

1) Variables: There was no rhyme or reason used in naming the variables.  Like 
I said, the program grew and I learned as I went. Does make things a little 
hard to follow though.

2) Modularity:  All the functions are independent of one another and any one 
can be removed and replaced.  An exception is that retn in the calendar routine
is the same instruction as reln (line 700).  Saves a few bytes.  A given module
will not run stand alone, however, as it depends on the definitions in line 10.


3) Use:  My Model 100 goes from home to office to home and on trips with me.  
TODO is usually in the computer and tends to keep me organized.  In fact I 
called it ORGIZR for a while.

4) Bug: There is a bug in the 12 hour clock routine (lines 70-75).  Between 12 
and 1 AM 0 not 12 is displayed.  It doesn't bother me enough to fix it since I 
don"t use the program much that time of day.  While in the area, line 77 
updates the display at midnight  for those times that I leave the computer on 
all night (using an AC adapter) to be my wake up alarm.

5) Bug 2: There is, also, a bug in the calendar routine (600 lines).  When 
"any" Month and Year is called while todays date is displayed, todays date is 
hi-lighted in the new month and year.

6) Windows: I'm not sure that I am technically correct in calling the 
rectangles in the displays "Windows", but I like "windows" better than "BOXES".


7) to-do: If someone can figure out a consistent spelling of todo, To-Do, TO-
DO, etc. let me know and I may revise this document.

I welcome comments or help reducing the size of the program while keeping all 
the features (I tend to be a byte fyter).  I will, also, be glad to answer any 
questions.  You can contact me by EMail or on the Message Board. Have Fun...
