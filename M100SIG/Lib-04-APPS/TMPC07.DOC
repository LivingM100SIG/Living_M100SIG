          The Procedure Reference Section summarizes how you can do most
          common tasks for which TMPC is useful.  For example: when you
          want to quickly add a task "to be done" to your list, how do you
          proceed" What if an appointment must be rescheduled?  This
          section answers these and other similar questions.

          Since this section answers practical questions directly, it is
          probably the first reference section to read.  However, the
          concise descriptions assume at least some familiarity with the
          Data Elements and the Screens, which are described in separate
          sections of the manual.  This difficulty is common in reference
          manuals: in a sense, you must read everything at once.  Don't be
          afraid to flip around in the reference section; if you get
          confused, read on patiently, and experiment with your TMPC
          program to clear up any ambiguity.

          We highly recommend reading the tutorial before reading the
          reference sections, especially the first lesson.  Even if you are
          a computer whiz, there may well be some new concepts for you in
          TMPC.

          To help you locate particular procedure descriptions below, this
          section proceeds in an outline.


                                  To-Do Procedures

          The to-do procedures described here all relate to the data
          element called the "to-do", as described in the "Data Elements"
          section.


          Adding a To-Do

          To add a new to-do to the warehouse, move to screen 1.  If you
          enter from screen 2 (Today's Date), the text-display area will
          always be blank; if you enter from screen 4 (View To-Do), the
          text-display area will contain the selected to-do from screen 4. 
          In either case, to add a to-do, press [Up-Arrow] into the "edit"
          block.

                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          When you enter the "edit" block, TMPC moves into the Model 100's
          TEXT program.  (If there was text in the text-display area of
          screen 1, it will appear in the TEXT program as well.)  At this
          point, type in a description of the to-do using the TEXT program
          features (see page 43 of the Model 100 manual).  Exit the TEXT
          program when you are finished by pressing [F8], and TMPC will
          return to screen 1.

          NOTE: If there is already a to-do in the text-display area when
          you enter the "edit" block, do not delete the text that appears
          there, unless you want to delete that to-do.  Instead, put the
          description for the new to-do after the existing one, separated
          with the [ENTER] key.  Similarly, you can enter more than one
          to-do at once by separating each one with the [ENTER] key.


          Editing and Deleting a To-Do

          To edit the description of a to-do, select it on screen 4 (View
          To-Do), then move directly to screen 1.  The description will
          appear in the text-display area.  Then, press [Up-Arrow] to move
          into the "edit" block.

          When you move into the "edit" block, TMPC will activate the Model
          100's TEXT program; the to-do description from the text-display
          area will be the active file.  You can then change the text as
          you wish; the to-do will be updated when you exit TEXT using
          [F8].

          If you exit the TEXT program after deleting all of the text, the
          to-do entry will be deleted.  You can also subdivide a to-do into
          several to-dos by separating each division with the [ENTER] key;
          each newly created to-do will have the same priority and stress
          ratings as the original.

          A to-do can also be deleted in screen 7 - see "Selecting daily
          to-dos" below.


          Ranking a To-Do

          To change the priority or stress rating of a to-do, select it on
          screen 4 (View To-Do), then move directly to screen 1.  The
          description will appear in the text-display area, and the
          priority and stress levels will appear under their respective
          blocks.  Then, press [Left-Arrow] to move over the "Priority"
          block, or [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] to move over the "Stress"
          block.  Press [Down-Arrow] over the desired block to change the
          priority rating or the stress rating.  The changes will be saved
          when leaving screen 1.

                                      Page: 33





                          Reference Section One: Procedures


          If a to-do is in the "unassigned" section of screen 4 (View
          To-Do), it will move to a different part of the list once you
          assign it both priority and stress.  Then, when you move back to
          screen 4 from screen 1, you will find that the selected item is
          now the next unassigned to-do in the list.  This feature allows
          you to move through the unassigned to-dos, assigning priority and
          stress to each one in succession (see the Tutorial, lesson 2, for
          an example).


          Selecting Daily To-Dos

          to select items from the warehouse for the daily list, first move
          to screen 8 (daily status) and check for items left over from
          earlier selections.  You may wish to process these individually
          (with screen 11), return all of them to the warehouse for
          re-selection, or simply leave them in the daily list.

          Then, move to screen 7 (Select to-do).  The text-display area
          will contain the description of one of a to-do from the
          warehouse; if there is no text, then there are no to-dos you can
          select.  You cannot select unassigned to-dos.

          There are three things you can do with the displayed to-do:


             # "Cycle" past it with [F1], which moves to the next to-do in
               the warehouse.

             # "Do" it, or select it for the daily list, with [F3].

             # "Cancel" it, or delete it from the warehouse list entirely,
               with [F5]


          Continue working through the warehouse list until your daily list
          contains a reasonable number of to-dos.  Consult the summary on
          screen 8 (daily status) as often as you need.


          Processing Daily To-Dos

          At various times during your day, you should process the daily
          list of to-dos.  Move to screen 11 (process to-do).  The
          text-display area will contain the description of the first to-do
          on the daily list; if there is no text, there are no daily to-dos
          on the list.  You can do one of four things with the daily to-do:

                          Reference Section One: Procedures

             # "Cycle" past it, with [F1].  This simply moves to the next
               daily to-do in the list.

             # Indicate it "done", with [F3].  The to-do is removed from
               the daily list and entered into the diary as completed.

             # "Cancel" it, with [F5].  The to-do is removed from the daily
               list and entered into the diary as canceled.

             # "Delay" it, with [F7].  The to-do is returned to the
               warehouse; no record is put into the diary.


          You can return every to-do in the daily list to the warehouse
          with a single keystroke by entering the "reset" block in screen 7
          (select to-do).  This block is the exact equivalent of pressing
          [F7] for every individual to-do in screen 11.


                               Date Related Procedures

          The date-related procedures described here all regard determining
          how busy a particular date is.  For example, how many
          appointments are there?  When is the next appointment scheduled? 
          Procedures for adding, modifying, and deleting appointments and
          memos are in the next section.


          Is Today a Holiday?

          If the date indicated by DATE$ in BASIC (called "today" for
          short) is listed as a business holiday in the task file, the name
          of the holiday will appear on the second line in screen 2
          (today's date).  The Julian date and the weekday are also
          indicated there.


          Selecting a Date for Inspection

          Screen 3 (appointment calendar) holds the capability to examine
          dates other than today.  Consult the screen reference section for
          complete details.

          Viewing Appointments for a Date

          Screen 6 (view appointments) will display the appointments,
          memos, and deadlines for a given date.  If you enter screen 6
          from screen 3 or screen 9, the date shown will be the last
          selected date; if you enter from screen 5, today's appointments
          will always be shown.  See the screen reference section for more
          detail on how to view the appointments.


                               Appointment Procedures

          The appointment procedures shown here serve to manipulate
          appointments and memos, as described in the Data Elements
          Reference section.  For brevity, both appointments and memos will
          be referred to as "items"


          Adding an Item

          First, select the date in screen 3 (appointment calendar).  Then,
          move to screen 6 (view appointments).  Check for conflicts.  If
          there are no items scheduled for that date, proceed to screen 9
          (add appointment).  Otherwise, select the item in the list that
          is above where you want the new item inserted.  Then move to
          screen 9.

          Note: The item list has three separate sections: appointments,
          memos, and deadlines.  If one of these is empty, and you want to
          add the first item - for example, there are no memos on the list
          and you want to add a memo - it does not matter which item you
          have selected.

          The text-display area in screen 9 will contain the description of
          the item you selected. (If there are no items, there will be no
          text.)  Press [Down-Arrow] to enter the "edit" block.  TMPC will
          activate the Model 100's TEXT program.  Enter the new item below
          the existing one, separating it with the [ENTER] key.  Do not
          delete the existing text, unless you want to delete the item it
          represents.  When you are done, press [F8], and TMPC will return
          you to screen 9.

          When screen 9 reappears, the text-display section will contain
          the new description you are entering.  As the final step to
          entering the new item, adjust the warning period, warning type,
          and repeat status as necessary - see the descriptions below for
          more detailed information.
