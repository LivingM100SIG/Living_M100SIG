BACKGROUND:

The program NAV2.BA (a.k.a. NAV2.BAS) can be used to help keep track of your
progress while driving on interstate highways.  It was inspired by a program
called NAV5 by William F. Green that was featured in the December 1990 issue
of Portable 100 magazine.  After trying NAV5, I found that it didn't quite
meet my needs so I wrote NAV2.BA, which I think is an improvement on the
concept.

NAV2.BA is a navigation tool that draws a simple highway map on the LCD
display and provides other interesting information about your status.  The
display includes important milestones along the map, your position on the map
relative to the milestones, ETAs to the milestones, and remaining fuel in your
tank.  NAV2.BA's calculations are based on a map data file you create using
the TEXT application, elapsed time, and average driving speed and fuel
consumption numbers you provide the program.  The map is drawn to scale and is
displayed in 54 mile segments on the M100/102 and 118 mile segments on the
M200.  You can "scroll" the map up and down to view the rest of it as
necessary.  The size of the map and distance covered is limited only by the
amount of RAM available for its storage.

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:

The program was written on a M102, but it should work on M100's  and M200's
with  no modification.  Version 2.0 corrects for the M200's different display.
 I have not tested NAV2.BA on anything other than a M102.

The checksum for NAV2.BA Version 2.0 is 384255 (as of 2/23/91).

You make map files with the built-in TEXT application or any wordprocessor
that produces an ASCII file.  You can get the information for the map file
from a regular road map.  A map file is a "sequential" data file consisting of
a record for each milestone you want to show on the map.  Each record has two
fields.  The first field is the distance to the milestone and the second field
is a short milestone description (only the 1st 15 characters of the
description will be displayed on the map).  The fields of each record must be
separated with a comma and the record must be terminated with a return.  The
last record in the map file must contain "9999,END" or problems will result. 
The following is a sample map file.

0,Pittsburgh PA
12,Rt 50 Ext & Oh Rvr
20,Evergreen Rd Exit
39,Rest Stop
60,Rt 422 Exit
69,Moraine St Prk
150,Erie PA
9999,END

Note that distance in the map file is total distance to the corresponding
milestone, not the distance between milestones.  Save the map file after
entering the data using a name like MAP.DO or something similar.

PROGRAM OPERATION AND DESCRIPTION:

When you select NAV2.BA from the main menu of the M100/102 or M200 you'll see
a title screen followed by a warning about operating motor vehicles while
under the influence of a portable computer (I strongly recommend that someone
other than the driver operate the computer for obvious safety reasons).  Each
of the screens will go away in a few seconds or you can press (almost) any key
to make them go away.

Next the program displays the top level of files in RAM and you're asked for
the name of the map file to use.  You might have several map files in RAM -
one for different trips.  Enter the name of the file you want to use without
the ".DO" extension then press ENTER.

You will then be asked to enter initial values for your estimated average
driving speed (SPD), current position or distance along the map (DST), fuel
load (FUL) and estimated fuel consumption (MPG).  You can press ENTER if you
want to accept the default values provided by the program or the NAVDAT.DO
file mentioned later in this document.  Change the line after the line that
says 'SET DFULT VLUS (near the top of program) if you want different default
values.  (NOTE: Program line numbers are omitted to make maintaining this
documentation easier - line numbers change with every version.)  The program
also beeps a warning when your remaining fuel reaches a default 5 gals. 
Change the line after the line that says 'LO FUL FLG (also near the top of the
program) if you want some other value.

Next you see the main display.  The main display includes the following:

A vertical line (map) on the left of the display that represents the road.  On
the left side of the line are "tick" marks marking off each 5 miles.  You'll
note that each pixel on the display is equal to one mile and the line is 54
miles long at this scale on the M100/102 and 118 miles on the M200.

On the right side of the vertical line are "tick" marks at the location of
each milestone in the map file.  These are also drawn in the proper place
according to the map's scale.

Also on the right side of the vertical line is a "current position" indicator
that increases in length as time passes.  This line starts at the bottom of
the "map" and moves toward the top - giving you an idea of where you are
relative to the milestones you've entered.

To the right of each milestone tick mark is a distance for the milestone. 
These are the distances you entered in the map file.

To the right of each milestone distance is the corresponding milestone
description (1st 15 characters only) you entered in the map file.

NOTE: If any two of your milestones are closer than 10 miles to each other,
the one that's farther away will over write the other on the display, but both
tick marks will be shown on the map.  Sorry, this can't be avoided.

To the right of each milestone description is a calculated estimated time of
arrival (ETA) based on your current position and average driving speed.  ETAs
for milestones behind your current position may need to be updated manually -
see description for F2 (ETAs) below.

On the right side of the main screen is a "Data Window."  This "window" shows
the current speed (SPD), distance along the map (DST), fuel remaining in your
tank (FUL), fuel consumption (MPG), and time of day.  This is the data that
the calculations are based on.  You can modify this data on the fly using the
"F-KEYS" as mentioned below.

The bottom line of the display shows the labels for the F-KEYS.  F1 through F8
and the "Arrow Keys" are used for the following functions:

F1 (GO/STOP) is used to start and stop the elapsed time clock.  Elapsed time
is used in all the calculations the program does.  Press GO (F1) when you
start driving.  The label for F1 changes to "STOP."  Press STOP (F1) when you
stop driving - for gas, food, etc.

F2 (ETAs) is used to update the ETAs shown for each milestone.  The only time
it's necessary to do this is if the current map section has been up for a
while and you want to know how long it will take to turn around and drive back
to a milestone you've passed.  The ETAs shown for the milestones ahead of you
are correct, but the ones behind you need to be updated because the ETAs
change as you drive away from them.  NAV2.BA doesn't update these
automatically because the update process would slow things down too much.

F3 (SPD+) is used to increase the average driving speed used in calculations
by 0.5 mph.  The new SPD is shown in the data window and is used in all
subsequent calculations.  Increase SPD if you find you are driving faster than
you estimated - or drive slower.

F4 (SPD-) is used to decrease the average driving speed used in calculations
by 0.5 mph.  The new SPD is shown in the data window and is used in all
subsequent calculations.  Decrease SPD if you find you are driving slower than
you estimated - or drive faster.

F5 (DST+) is used to increase the distance calculated to match that actually
covered.  The new DST is shown in the data window and is used in all
subsequent calculations.  Use this key to update the computer if you find it's
behind when you pass a milestone.  You might want to increase SPD or drive
slower too.

F6 (DST-) is used to decrease the distance calculated to match that actually
covered.  The new DST is shown in the data window and is used in all
subsequent calculations.  Use this key to update the computer if you find it's
ahead when you pass a milestone.  You might want to decrease SPD too.

F7 (FUL+) is used to increase the calculated amount of fuel remaining to match
that shown on your car's fuel gauge.  You may want to increase MPG too.

F8 (FUL-) is used to decrease the calculated amount of fuel remaining to match
that shown on your car's fuel gauge.  You may want to decrease MPG too.

LT Arrow is used to decrease MPG.  The new MPG is shown in the data window and
is used in all subsequent calculations.

RT Arrow is used to increase MPG.  The new MPG is shown in the data window and
is used in all subsequent calculations.

UP Arrow is used to scroll the map ahead in 54 or 118 mile increments. 
Distances, milestones and ETAs are shown for the part of the map you're
viewing.  A current position indicator will not appear if you are displaying a
part of the map you haven't gotten to yet.

DN Arrow is used to scroll the map back in 54 or 118 mile increments. 
Distances, milestones and ETAs are shown for the part of the map you're
viewing.  The current position indicator will appear from the bottom all the
way to the top of the map if you are displaying a part of the map you have
past.

SPACE BAR is used to quickly scroll back to the "current" section of the map. 
Press the SPACE BAR instead of repeatedly pressing the scroll keys to get back
to the current section of the map.  This way you can get back without looking
at the display.  Pressing the SPACE BAR also redraws the entire display so you
can use it to "repair" the display if it gets messed up somehow.

T or t is used to temporarily exit NAV2.BA so you can edit your map file using
the TEXT application (only on the M100/102).  You can press T or t at any time
while running NAV2.BA.  TEXT works as usual, except when you press F8 to quit
TEXT you'll be returned to NAV2.BA right where you left.  NAV2.BA will display
the revised map file and recalculate where you are relative to the milestones.
 This feature is handy for adding or revising milestones in your map file on
the fly.  By the way, the code in NAV2.BA that allows TEXT to be called from
within a BASIC program is from a copyrighted program called TXTCAL.100 by Mo
Budlong (CIS: 76167,3310).  NOTE - This feature is turned off if you are using
a M200 because TXTCAL.100 doesn't work with the M200 ROMs.  TXTCAL.100 also
doesn't work with "FLOPPY" or Node ROMs.  Unfortunately the program can't
detect if you'er using these so if you are, you'll have to manually make a
simple modification to a line of the program - see below for details.  

Q is used to quit the program and get back to the main menu.  That's a "Q" not
"q" (to reduce the chance of quitting by accident).  When you stop for gas,
press F1 to stop the elapsed time clock then press "Q" to exit the program. 
After getting fuel, rerun NAV2.BA and enter the new fuel load when entering
initial values.  Using "Q" to exit the program saves the last values for SPD,
DST, FUL and MPG in a text file called NAVDAT.DO.  When you rerun NAV2.BA, the
values in NAVDAT.DO are used as the defaults instead of those in the code of
the program (in the line after the one that says 'SET DFULT VLUS).  This
provides a handy way of picking up where you left off on a trip.  If you don't
use "Q" to quit, you'll have to remember SPD, DST, FUL and MPG and reenter
them all when you rerun the program.

The rest of the keyboard is dead except for the PAUSE/BREAK, PASTE, LABEL and
PRINT keys.  Don't press them - they cause problems for NAV2.BA.  If you do
press PAUSE/BREAK, PASTE, LABEL or PRINT, you'll probably have to press the
RESET button on the back of the computer then rerun NAV2.BA.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

When using NAV2.BA you can leave the computer on as you drive so you can check
your progress at a glance - the display will stay on as long as the batteries
hold up.  If you're concerned about conserving power, you can get an adaptor
to run the computer from the car's electrical system, or, you can turn off the
power switch WITHOUT QUITTING THE PROGRAM.  When you power back up, the
program will update its elapsed time clock & calculate correct numbers for DST
and FUL, but you'll have to press the space bar to redraw the display.

Carmen Paone [72677,42] has brought to my attention that TXTCAL doesn't work
with FLOPPY or NODE ROM.  He said: "It won't work with FLOPPY since FLOPPY
hogs the area to HIMEM and won't share it with other programs.  It won't work
with the NODE ROM chip; in fact, it causes garbled files on the DATAPAK
directory".  Because of this I've added a remark in the first few lines of the
program that should be modified by those using NAV2.BA on M100/102 systems
with FLOPPY or the NODE ROM.  The line that needs to be changed is normally a
remark that reads:

'NA=54:LL=280:MDL=0:GOTO 16 'IF FLOPPY OR NODE ROM IN M100/102

This line is normally ignored during program execution since it's a remark. 
To modify it, and make NAV2.BA work on systems with FLOPPY or the NODE ROM,
just remove the single quotation mark and turn it into an executable
statement.  It should look like this if you have to make this modification:

NA=54:LL=280:MDL=0:GOTO 16 'IF FLOPPY OR NODE ROM IN M100/102

When you run the program with this modification, all the TXTCAL related code
that would cause you problems will be skipped.  It follows that you wont be
able use the "T" feature mentioned above.

Carmen has also mentioned that Will Linden's TXTJMP.200 will do the same thing
in the M200 as Mo's TXTCAL does in the M100.  Will's program resides in the
ALTLCD buffer and doesn't cause conflict with Floppy or the Node rom. 
However, it does give users of the Cleauseau/ROM2 rom fits and causes screen
lockups.  One may want to consider adding TXTJMP to NAV2.BA to get the same
map file editing capability as the M100 version.

That's all except I'd like to thank Carmen Paone, Mo Budlong for the use of
his TXTCAL.100 code and Tony Anderson for his help.  Also, I'd like to know
what you think of NAV2.BA.  Please send any comments, suggestions and bug
reports via E-Mail on CIS.  I don't want to hear about anyone using NAV2.BA
while doing 70 mph at night in a blizzard (the road conditions the 1st time I
used it).  Finally, I don't intend to make a career out of NAV2.BA, but if I'm
in a goooood mood, I may kill some bugs.  Have fun - and keep your eyes on the
road!

REVISION HISTORY:

02/21/91
Added code to identify which computer program is running on (M100/102 or M200)
so TXTCAL.100 code could be skipped if running on M200.  Added code to correct
for M200 screen size.  Added comment that can be changed to a statement by
removing single quotation mark if user is running program on M100/102 system
with NODE ROM or FLOPPY.  Revised Documentation to reflect changes.
