TIMER.BA  -- A simple alarm clock program for the M100/M102
-----------------------------------------------------------

TIMER is a simple alarm program, suitable for reminding yourself that
the kettle is on for tea in the kitchen, or that you need to make a call
a 3:15 sharp, etc. It is operated entirely by function keys, which are
defined as follows:

F8 -- Exit    Terminates whatever is going on, and returns to the system
              menu.

F7 -- Clr     Clears current timing operation, returns clock to its
              initial, unset, status. Will also silence the alarm.

F6 -- Strt    Starts the timer, after the time limit or alarm time has
              been set. If the alarm has not been set, has no effect.

F5 -- Time/   Toggles the alarm mode. When the Time prompt appears
      Wait    the Set command sets a time of day for the alarm to go
              off. When the Wait prompts shows, Set expects the number
              of hours, minutes, and seconds to count down.


All time entries, be they time of day, or time to wait, are entered as
floating point numbers, in the following format:

              HH.MMSS

(the format used in HP calculators). For example, 3:15 PM would be entered
as:
              15.15 (note 24 notation)

and 25 minutes and 15 seconds would be:

               0.2515

Pressing any key when the alarm is sounding will reset the clock, and
stop the alarm.

No effort was made to allow for times over 24 hours, or timing past
11:59:59; if you need these functions you can add them -- all time
calculations are found in lines 200-999.

This program was constructed using the application template program,
SHELL.BA.
