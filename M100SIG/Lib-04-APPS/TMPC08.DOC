          There is one exception to this procedure: if you want to enter an
          item at the very beginning of its section.  For example, suppose
          that the first appointment you had listed for a date was 10:00
          am, and you wanted to add an 8:30 am appointment.  To accomplish
          the addition proceed as above until you are directly above the
          edit block in screen 9.  Then, press [Left-Arrow] [Right-Arrow];
          you will be in screen 9 with no description showing.  Enter TEXT
          and add the item, then modify it if necessary, as described
          above.  It will appear at the top of its section in screen 6.  An
          alternate way of putting an item at the very beginning of its
          section is to use "cut" and "paste", as demonstrated in Lesson 3
          of the tutorial.


          Deleting or Modifying an Item

          Before you can delete or modify an item, you must locate it.  Use
          screen 3 (appointment calendar) to select the date, and use
          screen 6 (view appointments) to select the item.  Then, move to
          screen 9.

          To delete the item or modify the description, use [Down-Arrow] to
          move into the "edit" box, and TMPC will activate the Model 100's
          TEXT program, with the description as the active file.  Make the
          changes you want; use [F8] to exit the TEXT program when done. 
          If you delete all of the text, TMPC will delete the item.

          An alternative way to delete an item (except a repeating item) is
          to select it in screen 6 and press [Right-Arrow] to move into the
          "cut" box.  If you then exit to screens 9 or 5, the item will be
          deleted.


          Rescheduling an Item

          This discussion does not apply to repeating items.  For full
          treatment of repeating items, refer to the Data Element Reference
          section.

          To reschedule an item, select it in screen 6 (view appointments),
          then press [Right-Arrow] to move into the "cut" box.  The item
          will disappear from the item list; the "paste" box will also
          appear, indicating that the item can be inserted again elsewhere. 
          You can use screen 3 (appointment calendar) to move to another
          date, if desired.  In screen 6, select the item after where you
          want the rescheduled item to appear; use [Left-Arrow] to move
          into the "paste" box.  The item will appear before the selected
          item.  If you try to paste an item into a different section, it
          will not go in where you have selected, but at the top of its
          proper section.

          Assigning a Warning

          You can put a warning on any item.  The warning will cause the
          item to appear as a deadline in the days leading up to the item. 
          To assign a warning, select the item in screen 6 (view
          appointments), then move directly to screen 9.  Press
          [Right-Arrow] to move over the "warning" box; press [Down-Arrow]
          to move into the box.  A cursor will flash in the three-space
          bar; type in the number of days warning.  (If you make an error,
          you can continually retype the number - only when you press
          [ENTER] is the number accepted.)  After you press [ENTER], press
          [Right-Arrow] to move over the "warning type" box.  If necessary,
          adjust the warning type by pressing [Down-Arrow].  The two
          possible values are as follows:


             # "Bday" means business days, and expresses the deadline in
               weekdays, excluding holidays.

             # "Cday" means calendar days, which counts every day as part
               of the deadline.


          In addition to showing deadlines, you can use the warning feature
          to determine the number of business or calendar days between two
          dates.  Simply set a large warning value on a test memo (for
          example, "days remaining before 7/18"), move to the earlier date,
          and examine the "deadline" portion of the item list.  However,
          long deadlines slow down TMPC, so we don't recommend leaving
          these test memos permanently.


          Indicating a Holiday

          A holiday is nothing more than a memo with a warning of "0
          Bdays".  Use the procedures above to enter the memo; the text of
          the memo should be the name of the holiday.


          Repeating Entry Items

          Refer to screen 14 reference in the Screen Reference Section for
          more information about how to manipulate repeating entry items.

                                 General Procedures

          The procedures in this section deal with miscellaneous
          activities, all related to RAM files on the Model 100.


          Adding a Remark to the Diary

          The diary is a record file.  TMPC adds to the diary only when
          "starting up" (when you first enter the program), and then only
          if there is a new date.  For example, if you enter TMPC on March
          16, and the last time you entered it was on March 15, the diary
          will be updated.

          The diary will contain three major types of entries:


             # The single-entry (not repeating) appointments and memos from
               all days prior to today.  These items are removed from the
               task file once added to the diary.

             # The repeating appointments and memos which have had entries
               in the days prior to today.  Repeating entries are not
               deleted when entered into the diary.

             # All to-dos processed as "done" or "canceled" in the last
               session.  These are deleted from the task file and listed in
               the diary under the date when TMPC was last activated.


          The diary file always has the name, DIARY.DO.  New entries will
          be made on the end of this file, regardless of what the rest of
          it contains - so, take care not to mix entries from several task
          files together.  However, once the entries have been made, you
          can examine them as you would any other document file, and make
          changes as you see fit.

          Because the diary is a text file, it is simple to add remarks to
          it - simply use the TEXT program.

                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          However, if you want to add a remark to today's diary entry today
          (as opposed to tomorrow until TMPC makes the entry tomorrow), the
          best way is to add a memo into today's item list.  If you enter
          screen 9 (add appointment) from screen 8 (daily status), you will
          always see a blank text-display area.  Press [Down-Arrow] to
          enter the "edit" block, and use the TEXT program to add the
          remark.  Once you are finished, exit the TEXT program with [F8],
          and the remark will be put on today's item list - and will
          eventually wind up in the diary.


          Turning off the Diary

          For various reasons, you may not be interested in a diary file. 
          You can suppress any additions to the diary file by moving to
          screen 10, and pressing [Down-Arrow] to move into the "diary"
          block.  This block will toggle the diary on and off.  Turning the
          diary off does not delete the diary file; it only prevents
          further entries.


          Changing the Task File

          The task file contains all of the to-dos, memos, and
          appointments, and also stores the last activation date.  So,
          using two different task files is like maintaining two separate
          date books - both completely independent of each other.  You may
          be interested in doing this if you have many appointments at
          work and many more in some outside activity.

          Task files are always document files.  You can use TELCOM to
          transmit and receive task files, and you can save them to
          cassette tape using TEXT.  However, never change a task file with
          TEXT unless you know what you're doing.  A technical description
          of the task-file format appears in part 1 of the Technical
          Reference Section.

          To change the task file while in TMPC, move to screen 10 and
          press [Down-Arrow] to move into the "Task File" block.  The
          screen will clear, and TMPC will prompt, "Task File?"  Respond
          with the new name; the ".DO" extension is not necessary.  If you
          type a nonexistent file name, TMPC will create a new task file. 
          If you type an existing task file's name, TMPC will update the
          diary (which is always called DIARY.DO), if necessary, from the
          new task file.  You can mix entries in the diary if you aren't
          careful.  Be certain that you either turn the diary off, or that
          you've renamed the diary file (use the BASIC NAME command) before
          activating another task file.

                          Reference Section One: Procedures

          The task file has some precise internal formats.  If these
          formats get changed by program error or by your tampering, the
          message, "Task File Contains Internal Errors" will appear, and
          TMPC will abruptly return you to the main menu.  When re-entering
          TMPC, you must then specify another task file, or fix the
          corrupted one first.
