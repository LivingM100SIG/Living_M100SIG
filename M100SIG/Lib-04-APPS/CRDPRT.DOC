This file will describe the card and label printing, paper listing, and report
listing programs that utilize data retreived from a datafile created by the
CRDFIL.BAS program on a Model 100/102 or Tandy 200.  The DOC file is being
developed in modules, based on release of the separate programs.
 
 
Program #1, CRDFIL.PR1 prints cards or labels of selected data fields in any of
several user-designed formats. - Now available, 1/3/88
 
Program #3, CRDFIL.PR3 prints lists of selected data from the files in selected
order. - Now available, 1/10/88

CRDFIL.PR1
 
This program is designed mainly to print on cards or labels, from the datafile
created by CRDFIL.BAS on a Model 100, 102 or Tandy 200.  It offers many user
selectable options, making it quite flexible and virtually "customizable".  The
program follows the same logical flow as the CRDFIL program uses, and offers
help and instruction screens throughout to tell a user where he is in the
program, what is coming up next, and what options he has.
 
The program begins with a series of question screens designed to set up the
user-selected output format that will eventually go on the cards.  The first
creen asks for the name of the data file, and verifies it is available.
 
The next option is to print all the cards, or only those cards with a selected
matching `word'. The match can be in upper or lower-case letters, the program
comparing for all forms.  Selection of the actual match word comes later in the
program.
 
The next screen asks if the output is to be in chronological order, the way
the data was entered into the file, or in a pseudo-sorted form, with the cards
in "character groups" (as opposed to a "real" sort).  If the sort option is
selected, the cards will be grouped with all the numbered entries together,
followed by all the alphabetic entries, grouped by character.  All the A's
together, all the B's together, etc. Sort is on the first letter of a specified
key entry.  Cards may be sorted on numbers only, upper or lower-case letters,
or any combination of the three.
 
You will be shown the original cardfile screen prompts, and be allowed to
change any that are inappropriate, or need to be corrected before printing.
You will also be allowed to `deselect' any data fields you do not want printed
on the cards; thus extracting only sprecified fields from the datafile to go
to the printer.
 
You will be asked for the number of lines on the card or label stock, and the
number of entries to be printed on the card will be calculated, giving you
proper output for continuous card stock.  You can also specify top and left
margins for the card.  Cards will not be printed in screen format, the way they
show up on your screen, but will be in a one-line, one-entry form.  If seven
entries are selected to be printed, they will be printed on seven consecutive
lines.
 
For the last option, your search word is asked for, and if in lower-case, it
is adjusted to upper case.  You can specify the entry number where this search
word is likely to be found.  As the program reads the entries from the file,
each search field will be converted to upper case, and a comparison made to the
specified search word.  Matches will be printed. - in sorted order if that
option has been selected.
 
Regardless of the options selected, once all the preliminary input has been
completed, the program will print continuously until the job is complete.  The
sorted output will take much longer than chronological output, since the data
has to be read from the file many times, looking for a first letter match for
the sorting routine in the sort key entry.  If you know that there will be no
numbers in the sort key, or no lower-case letters, you can save time by setting
your sort parameters to ignore numbers and lower-case letters.  If sorting by a
date field, you can assume there will be no letters there, and can eliminate
sorting by letters when asked.  Sorting by characters other than numbers or
upper/lower-case alphabet characters is not enabled.
 
By selecting different options, various output formats can be generated from
the same datafile.  One of the most unique combinations is sorted output of
cards with selected match words.  You can print a list of names and telephone
numbers from those cards with `Texas' on the `State' line, in sorted order by
`City'!"  It's possible!

CRDFIL.PR3
 
This module allows you to select which fields from your cards will be listed
to the printer, and in what order.  The general purpose is to provide a summary
list of data from the cards.  For example, you might like to have a list of
names and phone numbers, extracted from and name and address file.  Or a list
of names and addresses only.  --  Now available in the library
