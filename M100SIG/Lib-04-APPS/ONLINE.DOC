     ONLINE.200 calculates and records the total cost of each TELCOM session.
The program stores the information in the file ONLINE.DO, and a running
monthly total is also calculated.
Examples are included for CIS and GENIE, and provision is made to add other
services if desired.
     When run, the program first prompts for the service being used.
The program then prompts for the total time in minutes,
returning the current and monthly costs.
     The following options are then displayed:
	F1: LIST lists current monthly usage.
	F2: TELCOM jumps to TELCOM.
	F4: RUN 
	F5: OFF turns the 200 off.
	F8: MENU jumps to menu.
     Individual users must make the following changes:
	Line 3: TI=the cost (cents) for the initial minute of phone time.
	        TS=the cost (cents) for each additional minute.
	Lines 10-29: information is entered in this format -
         ## IFS$="N"ORS$="n"thenT1=xx
	    :S$="N"
	    :GOTO31
	 '##' is the line number,
	 'N,n' correspond to the INPUT from line 4,
	 'xx' is the cost in cents per minute for connect time
 (i.e. COMPUSERVE=10).
     Model 100 users will have to change the 'PRINT@,' statements,
and change the CALL in line 46 from 24573 to 20806 (jump to TELCOM).
     Thanks to Tony A. for the info in CALLS.ROM (DL4).
