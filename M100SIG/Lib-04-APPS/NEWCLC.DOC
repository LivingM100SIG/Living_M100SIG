    This program occupies about 3.7K in 
.BA  form and about  5.2K  in .DO form. 
There are  no comments  to remove.  For 
those of you who are particularly tight 
on memory  there are a  number of lines 
that  can be combined to  form a single 
line with  a  length  in excess  of 127 
characters.  Two  examples  are 100-102 
and  105-107.  I broke  these  apart to 
facilitate the download to CIS.
    The  program  is  an  RPN ( Reverse 
Polish  Notation)   calculator  with an 
operating range of +/-9.99999999E+/-999 
It operates  as  follows:  the function 
keys  are  used to  perform the various 
calculator operations.  The four  level 
stack  is always  displayed  above  the 
definitions of the function keys. There 
are  three  different  sets of function 
keys,  which  may  be cycled through by 
using the up and down arrow keys of the 
Model 100.  The  delete key will delete 
the last digit entered, the shift  BKSP 
(shift-delete) key  will clear the last 
stack  entry  (also known  as  X).  The 
minus  key  performs  the  change  sign 
function and the right arrow key allows 
entry  of  an exponent.  The ESC key is 
used as  the  MENU  key.  I do not have 
enough room to describe the use of RPN, 
I leave this up to the user.
    If you find bugs, or  have any good 
ideas  on  how  to  modify this program 
please let me know (73126,1104).
