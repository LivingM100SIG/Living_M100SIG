        What is SPEAKER.DVI?

           SPEAKER.DVI is a utility  to  aid  an  individual  in
        designing the optimum speaker enclosure.  The user needs
        to have the specification sheet commonly  provided  with
        the speaker or the specs are  sometimes  listed  in  the
        manufacture's catalog.   SPEAKER.DVI  will  calculate  a
        varieity of boxes with  different  frequency  charastics
        and  the  user  must  choose   one   that   fits   their
        application.  SPEAKER.DVI then will step the  height  or
        depth through a range entered by the user and  show  the
        combinations which will produce the best enclosure.  The
        user  must  have  some  knowledge  in  building  speaker
        cabinets.   SPEAKER.DVI  will   not   give   "carpentry"
        information, just the INSIDE dimentions  that  the  user
        can use to construct the box.


        What SPEAKER.DVI must know.

          The information that it must have is usually  provided
        with most quality  speakers.   The  speaker's  free  air
        resonance (Fo), equivalent air volume (Vas), Diameter of
        the  speaker  (D),  and  the  total  Q  (Qts)  are   the
        information  points  usually  provided   and   are   all
        SPEAKER.DVI need to perform its calculations.


        What will SPEAKER.DVI tell me?

          SPEAKER.DVI  will,   after   entering   the   required
        information, calculate  the  optimum  width,  depth  and
        height for an array of combinations  varying  in  volume
        and frequency responce.  It will also,  if  selected  by
        the  user,  send  all  results  to  the  printer  for  a
        perminant record.  The prelimenary information  provided
        is the Q of the box (Qb), the internal volume of the box
        (Vb), the Q ratio (Qr) between the box Q and the speaker
        Q, volume ratio (Vr), resonant frequency of the  speaker
        mounted in the box  (Fsb),  the  3dB  low  end  roll-off
        frequency (F3dB), and the width, depth, and  the  height
        based on the optimum w-d-h ratio.   The  user  needs  to
        select a combination that fits their  application  based
        on  the  roll-off  frequency,  resonant  frequency   and
        possibly  size  limitations  that  may  be  involved  in
        placing the cabinet in a  crowded  room  or  on  a  book
        shelf.  Using SPEAKER.DVI you can sit  with  a  list  of
        specs  out  of  a  catalog  and  run  through  literally
        hundreds of calculations that would take hours to do  on
        a calculator.  SPEAKER.DVI also plots a graph on the LCD
        screen showing the ratio of the box volume (Vb) and  the












        3 dB  roll-off  frequency  so   you   have   a   graphic
        representation of the information  provided  in  numeric
        form on the CRT or printer.

           If the printer option is selected,  SPEAKER.DVI  will
        try to call XCOPY to dump the LCD to a Radio  Shack  DMP
        series printer.  If you don't have this program or don't
        have a DMP printer, you will have to edit the line  that
        loadms and calls XCOPY to call a LCD screen dump program
        for  your  printer  or   simply   remove   the   feature
        alltogather.  XCOPY.CO is created by DMP.DMP  and  loads
        into the alternate LCD buffer so it  doesn't  require  a
        HIMEM setting or protected  memory  so  will  work  with
        almost anything in himem.

          After  you  choose  a  combination  that   fits   your
        application, SPEAKER.DVI will ask wheather you  wish  to
        step through Width & Depth  (and  calculate  Height)  or
        Width & Height (and  calculate  Depth).   You  are  then
        prompted for the ranges for  both  Width  and  Depth  or
        Height depending on which one you  select.   SPEAKER.DVI
        will then step through the combinations  and  point  out
        the ones that will  fit  the  optimum  ratio.   All  the
        dimentions that are presented in this  table  will  work
        and their internal volumes are all the  same,  only  the
        width, depth and height dimentions will change.  It will
        calculate the ratios and display them also.

          Other options of SPEAKER.DVI are to  calculate  values
        for a Ported reflex or an Acoustic suspention enclosure.
        It will also calculate the width, depth and height based
        on the optimum ratio for a volume entered by  the  user.
        Also, SPEAKER.DVI will calculate the internal volume  of
        an enclosure with dimentions provided by the user.


        What else will you need besides SPEAKER.DVI?

          To complete the Ported Bass Reflex enclosure, you will
        have to use the tables in the Radio Shack book "Building
        Speaker Systems", catalog # 62-1087  as  of  this  date,
        listed at $5.95, well worth it if you are  serious  abot
        making your own  speaker  cabinets.   If  you  have  any
        carpenter in you, the book probably will not  be  needed
        for the acoustic suspention box  but  before  purchasing
        any components, material or  wood,  I  highly  reccomend
        that you obtain a copy of the book and read through  the
        construction information.


        How does SPEAKER.DVI work?

          The formulas that are in the  Radio  Shack  book  have
        implemented in SPEAKER.DVI using  the  loops  and  other












        conditional statements provided  by  BASIC.   You  could
        design your cabinet  without  SPEAKER.DVI,  but  to  run
        through various combinations on a hand calculator  would
        be  very  cumbersome  and  time  consuming.    Also,   I
        developed a formula to compute the optimum  W-D-H  ratio
        of a given volume.  This formula is  not  in  the  book.
        The ratio provided in the book is 1:.6:1.6.  This  means
        that the depth should be .6  times  the  width  and  the
        height should be 1.6  times  the  width.   Deriving  the
        formula:

         V=Volume,H=Height,D=Depth,W=Width

          V  = W x D x H

          V  = W x .6W x 1.6W

          V  = W x .6W x 1.6W
         ---   --------------
         W^3   W  x  W  x  W

          V  = 1 x .6 x 1.6
         ---
         W^3

          V  = .96 W^3

          V  = W^3
         ---
         .96

              ______
           3 /  V
         \  /  ---    =  W
          \/   .96

        D=.6W
        H=1.6H
        And is Basic it is:

        W=(V*.96)^(1/3):D=.6*W:H=1.6*W
          Since most computers don't have a cube  root,   simply
        rase the figure to the 1/3rd power.

          You are welcome to make modifications to the  program.
        If you do, please make them  obvoius  and  if  possible,
        upload a copy with  a  changed  version  number  to  the
        Compuserve Model 100 SIG, library 4  (Applications).   I
        do request that you leave my  name  and  number  in  the
        program and menus but you may add yours if you like.

          If you have any recomendations or questions,  you  may
        leave E-mail to me on CIS, 73577,3041.
