                                Information Presented

          This screen shows the months of a year on which the repeating
          item occurs.  Note that more than on month can be indicated, by
          the "x" in the corresponding box.  Also, each day of the month is
          individually indicated.  All of the indicated days and months are
          combined for the repeating action; for example, if "January" and
          "September", "1" and "11" were all indicated, the item would
          repeat on the first and eleventh of both January and September. 
          You may have to create more than one repeating-entry item for
          some combinations of dates, such as January 11 and August 31.


                                      Functions

          You can move the stick figure to any of the months or days;
          pressing [Up-Arrow] into the boxes will toggle the days (or
          months) on and off.  You can specify the "last" day of a month,
          which could be the 28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st days.

          You can also restrict the repeating action to business days. 
          Press [Down-Arrow] into the "scan" box, and it will cycle
          between no scan, forward scan, and reverse scan.  When "forward
          scan" is on, the repeating date will occur on the first business
          day after the exact date, if necessary.  For example, if January
          11 is on a Sunday, "forward scan" will put the repeating date on
          January 12, which is a Monday.  Similarly, "backward scan" will
          put the repeating date on the last business day before the exact
          date.

                                        Exit

          The only exit is to screen 9, where you can modify the warning or
          the description of the item.  If the changes you made to the
          repeating item are such that the current date no longer falls on
          the repeating date, the current date will move forward to the
          first day that fills them.  If you exit the screen with no months
          (or no days) specified, the repeating date will return to
          whatever it was when you entered the screen.

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

          The technical reference section discusses topics of a more arcane
          interest than the rest of the manual.  You don't need any of the
          information in this section to be a good user of TMPC; however,
          it might come in handy if you want to write a program on another
          computer to "talk" to TMPC, or if you're just curious about how
          TMPC works.  Because this section is optional, we have made no
          attempt to make it readily understandable - it isn't intended as
          a primer in assembly language programming techniques.


                                    Startup Notes

          When you activate TMPC, several things happen before the first
          screen appears:


             # The last-used task file (or TOM.DO if the program has been
               newly loaded from tape) is opened; if there is no such file,
               the prompt "Task File Name?" appears, and you must type in a
               name.

             # If the file is new, TMPC inserts a set of control stops to
               it - see the section below on task file formats.  If the
               file exists, TMPC checks to make sure that the character
               counts are consistent with the control stops.  If an error
               occurs, a message will appear, and TMPC terminates back to
               the main menu.  After such a termination, you will always
               get a "Task File Name?" prompt.

             # The current date in the Model 100's memory is checked for
               feasibility.  Ridiculous dates, like March 34, are changed
               to the last day of the month.  Only the years 1980 - 2069
               can be used with TMPC.  Note that dates represented as 1900
               - 1969 in the main menu will appear as 2000 - 2069 in TMPC. 
               If an illegal year is set on the menu when TMPC is
               activated, a message will appear and control will return to
               the main menu.

             # A special case occurs on March 1 of leap years.  Since the
               Model 100's ROM software does not recognize leap year, TMPC
               will change March 1 to February 29 unless the task file
               shows February 29 as the last activated date.  This is not a
               perfect "fix", and in some cases (such as when it really is
               March 1, and TMPC was not used on February 29) it will lead
               to errors.  Let the user beware.  [Ed. Note: !]

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

             # If today is more than one day after the last activation date
               (called "LAD") in the task file, both dates appear on the
               screen with the prompt, "proceed?".  This prompt allows a
               user to avoid processing diary entries if the date has been
               erroneously changed.  Further, if the LAD is chronologically
               after DATE$, TMPC will not proceed.  If TMPC stops execution
               at this point, the task file must be re-specified upon the
               next entry.

             # If there are any to-dos in the "processed" section of the
               task file, they are entered in the diary.  Single-date items
               are deleted from the task file once entered into the diary.


          NOTE: No entries to the diary will be made if the diary is
          deactivated; if the Model 100's memory is exhausted while making
          diary entries, TMPC will abort the entry process.  After this
          happens, you should check for possible duplicate entries in the
          diary.


             # The LAD is updated to today in the task file.


                                  Task File Format

          The task file is divided up into seven sections, as follows:


            1. The Header and date. These serve to identify the file as a
               legitimate task file; it seems unlikely enough that any
               other DO file would start with the letters "tMpC"!

            2. To-do warehouse.  An ordered list of all the to-dos in the
               warehouse.

            3. Daily list.  The list of to-dos allocated to be done today.

            4. Processed to-dos.  The list of to-dos waiting to be written
               to the diary and removed from the task file.

            5. Single-date items.

            6. Weekly-repeating items.

            7. Monthly-repeating items.


          Each section (except the first) is variable length, and followed

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

          by a terminating string.  Each is a list of item-blocks, which
          have the following general format:


                                    Header bytes
                                   Character Count
                               Description Characters


          It is the character count which makes a check necessary to make
          sure that the task file is valid.  Even the smallest change could
          send the software off into a list of an indefinite number of
          blocks extending past the file's end.  So, the software checks
          the character counts upon opening the file (and at other times
          too) to ensure that all is well.

          The number and function of the header bytes depend on the
          particular section. Below are descriptions of each set of header
          bytes.  In the descriptions, "bit 0" refers to the least
          significant.  All data is limited to six bits per byte, and every
          value has an offset of 32 added in.  This is crucial.  The
          offsets prevent any characters from having an ASCII of 26 (which
          would terminate the file) or over 127 (which would complicate
          transmission to other computers, etc)


          To-Dos in Sections 2-4 (One byte)

          A bit mask.  Bit 4 is always set. Bits 0 and 1 together indicate
          the stress (0 = unassigned, 1 = level c, etc.).  Bits 2 and 3
          together indicate the priority (0 = unassigned, 1 = priority 1,
          etc.).


          Single-Date Items (6 bytes total)

          The first two bytes are the warning days.  A total of 10 bits are
          used, with the least significant six in the first byte.  The
          maximum value ever put there by TMPC is 999.

          The next three bytes are the date of the appointment, expressed
          as a day, month and year respectively.  Note that these values
          are offset by 32.  The "year" value is the number of years
          elapsed since 1980.  This is the format of the date at the
          beginning of the task file, also.

          The final byte is a flag byte in the form of a bit-mask.  Bits 0
          and 1 are always 0; bit 2 is set if the item has a type "b"
          warning; bit 3 is set if the item is an appointment and reset for
          a memo; bit 4 is always 0; bit 5 is always set.

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information



          Weekly Repeating Items (6 bytes total)

          The first two bytes are the warning period, in the same format as
          fixed-date items.

          The third byte is a bit-mask for the weeks of each month which
          are active; bit 0 is for the first week through bit 5, which is
          for the fifth week.  Bit 6 is for the last week, which can be set
          independently of the fifth or fourth weeks.

          Bytes 4 and 5 form a bit-mask for the weekdays.  Bits 0 through 5
          in byte four are for Sunday through Friday, respectively, and bit
          1 of byte 5 is for Saturday; the remaining bits are not used.

          Byte 6 is a bit-mask.  Bit 0 is always set; bit 1 is always 0;
          bit 2 is set if the warning is type "b"; bit 3 is set for an
          appointment and reset otherwise; bit 4 is always 0; bit 5 is
          always set.


          Monthly Repeating Items (11 bytes total)

          Bytes 1 and 2 are the warning, just as for fixed-date items.

          Bytes 3 through 8 form a bit-mask for the days of the month.  Bit
          0 of byte 3 is for the first day, and bit 1 of byte 8 is for the
          thirty-first day.  Bit 5 of byte 8 is for the last day of the
          month, which can be set independently.

          Bytes 9 and 10 are for the months of the year.  Bit 0 of byte 9
          is for January, and bit 5 of byte 10 is for December.

          Byte 11 is a flag byte in the form of a bit-mask.  Bit 0 is set
          if the date will search, either forward or backward, to the next
          business day.  Bit 1 is always set.  Bit 2 is set if the warning
          is type "b".  Bit 3 is set if the item is an appointment.  Bit 4
          is set if the search for business day is backward, and reset
          otherwise.  Bit 5 is always set.


          Terminators and Empty Sections

          Each section of blocks ends with a terminator of spaces; the
          number of spaces corresponds to the number of header bytes.  So,
          each to-do section terminates with on space, the fixed items and
          weekly-repeating items each end with 6 spaces, and the monthly
          items end with 11 spaces.  These terminators must be in place
          even if there are no items; thus, the minimum legal task file is

                    Reference Section Four: Technical Information

          33 bytes long: Four header characters, three characters for the
          date, and 26 spaces.


          Example Programs

          Two example BASIC programs come on the tape to illustrate how the
          task file can be manipulated.  The first, PTODO.BA, prints the
          entire contents of the warehouse to the screen.  The second,
          APPT.BA, adds appointments to the single-date section of the
          calendar.  Both programs contain enough comments to document
          themselves.
