TMPC '3 in 1' Simple Report Generator
by Jean-Luc Crevier [73720,2456]


I like TMPC even if it takes a lot of space in my Tandy 102. Some reporting
features are missing though. After 4 months of on-and-off usage, I came up
with this basic program FIND+.MPC. This short and simple program incorporates
some (not all) features already found in SEARCH.MPC and PTODO.BA provided by
Acroatix - but it offers some extra options. I wrote this software after
analyzing the technical section of the manual and the program listings. I am
not a machine language programmer. As a layman, I am just familiar with BASIC.
So it took me some time to understand enough to write my program.

With FIND+.MPC, you can search trough any TMPC task file (you don't need
TMPC.CO) and perform 3 useful operations:

1. Locate simultaneously any items using a target string (case sensitive) in
   the TODO section, DAILY LIST section (even cancelled and done items) and
   SINGLE DATE appointment section - weekly and monthly repeating sections
   are not supported.

2. Locate single date appointements using a TARGET DATE - weekly and
   monthly repeating sections are not supported.

3. Output ENTIRE CONTENT of task file (todos & appointments) - weekly and
   monthly repeating sections are not supported.


     Sample run of program:

(PROMPT) Task file:

     Edit line 34 for default task file name.
     Just <enter> will use this default file name.
     If the task file is not found, the program will beep and warn you.


(PROMPT) Output file:

     Just <enter> defaults to a ram file named REPORT.DO. You may use any legal
device:filename ex. lcd:,lpt:,cas:report


(PROMPT) <D>ate or <I>tem

     If you press 'D' or 'd', you'll see this:

(PROMPT) Date as MM/DD/YY (enter=today)

     If you enter an invalid date, the program will trap the error.

     If you pressed 'I' (or in fact any other key), you'll see this:

(PROMPT) Target string:

     This search is case sensitive. Just <enter> will output all todos and all
single date appointments - weekly and monthly repeating appointments WILL NOT
be included. For complete reporting options, see my earlier programs
APPTR1.MPC and APPTR2.MPC in this data library.

     While the date or item search is performed and found items are printed,
you may pause the output list by pressing the <space bar>. Any other key
will resume the operation. Pressing the <esc> key WHILE PRINTING will quit the
program and return to Tandy 102/Model 100 main menu.

     I find my search/report utility especially useful when I must kill
TMPC.CO because I need this 9K of extra space for awhile - when writing a long
document for example. This way I can still consult my task file by date or
by item. When I reinstall TMPC.CO, I use APPT.BA to append any appointment or
memo temporarily entered in NOTE.DO.
For todos entered in a transit document
file, I use the Sel & Cut functions of TEXT before entering TMPC. Once in the
add a todo screen (edit block), I use Paste to add these todos.
