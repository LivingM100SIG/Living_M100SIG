DIRECTIONS FOR CUESHEET CREATOR
---------------------------------

   THERE ARE TWO MODES FOR OPERATING THIS PROGRAM, DEPENDING ON YOUR MOOD 
AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE BEFORE AIR.

   NORMALLY, YOU IGNORE THE "CRASHTIME" OPTION AND PROCEED THRU YOUR SPOT,
ENTERING IN THE:

 TIME

 THE AUDIO CUE (NOTE THAT YOU HAVE TWO LINES TO WORK WITH--HIT ">" TO START
 THE SECOND LINE)

  THE VIDEO (FOR INSTANCE--"A VTR" OR 
"MACHINE 53")

 THE AUDIO ("A CH1 FULL" OR "53 CH2 BG")

 AND THE EFFECT (E.G. "SLASH--DC" OR "SUPER:JONES")

AGAIN, YOU HAVE TWO LINES FOR ALL NOTES.

   IF YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN ENTER ALL THE TIMES ON THE FLY BY TAKING THE "CRASH"
OPTION.  THIS ENABLES A CLOCK AND STARTS A NEW LINE EVERY TIME YOU HIT A KEY 
UNTIL YOU HIT "E".  THEN YOU DUMP BACK TO THE EDIT MODE TO COMPLETE THE NOTES.

   THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, SO LET ME KNOW OF CHANGES AND ADDITTIONS.
    TERRY IRVING 74025,1036
