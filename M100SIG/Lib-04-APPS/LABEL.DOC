Sysop Note:  Label 100 was written by Fred Berney (71020,1207) in 1984 to
produce multiple copies of audio cassette labels on-site, where he was making
many copies of labels for seminar and convention attendees.  He originally
wrote the program for the Model 100, and ported it over to the PC platform when
he began using a laptop PC.  Interestingly, the program runs interchangeably in
the Model 100 or a PC under GW-BASIC.
 
In a recent conversation on the Broadcast Professional's forum, I asked Fred to
contribute a copy of the program to the Model 100 library for archiving.  He
sent me the files, including the below "DOC" file, which was primarily written
as an instruction file for use of the program on a PC.  The "Model 100
Instruction File" is an edited copy for Model 100 users. - Tony Anderson 9/3/94

Program Description:
 
LABEL.100 is a Model 100 or PC (GW-BASIC) program that prints repetitive copies
of audio cassette labels, primarily designed for tape duplicators who are doing
on-site seminar and convention cassettes. Designed for continuous, tractor-feed
labels and printers that accomodate such use.
 
Program Checksum is 95,866

                INSTRUCTIONS FOR LABEL PROGRAM ON PC
 
1. Insert disk, change to proper drive (ie. type A: if disk is in drive A),
then type BASIC.
 
2. The screen should read GW-BASIC at the top and a flashing cursor should
appear below the word OK.
 
3. Type LOAD "LABEL.BAS" (IMPORTANT - BE SURE AND INCLUDE QUOTATIONS)
 
4. Type LIST        (A LISTING OF THE PROGRAM SHOULD APPEAR)
 
5. Type EDIT 4  press ENTER
 
6. Line 4 will now appear. Move the cursor to where the letters 'ABC' appear.
Place the cursor above the letter A. Delete these letters by touching the
delete key three times.
 
7. Press the INSERT KEY and type in the abbreviation of the association that
you want to appear at the start of the program.  Press ENTER
 
8. Type EDIT 15  press ENTER
 
9. Where you see the words "TYPE IN YOUR NAME HERE" delete these words and
replace with your own company name. Do the same for the address.
 
IMPORTANT: Make sure your name and address appear with the quotations. When
finished replacing the name and address press ENTER
 
10. Type EDIT 150  press ENTER
 
11. Where you see the words TAPE FC- you can change this to whatever code you
use at the start of each tape number. The actually tape number will be printed
automatically. For example all of our conferences tapes start with a two letter
code. If the words TAPE FC- were left unchanged, the first label will print as
TAPE FC-1
 
12. Where you see the letters AACD, change these to read your association
letters.
 
13. Type LIST 210 press ENTER
 
14. Line 210 will appear on the screen. The label program prints in the
following format:
 
     TAPE FC-1                                           AACD
     FIRST LINE OF COPY (this line will automatically center)
     SECOND LINE OF COPY (this line will automatically center)
 
               (this is the open hole in the label)
 
     YOUR NAME (this line will automatically center)
     YOUR ADDRESS (this line will automatically center)
 
 
15. Decide what you want to print on the first and second line of the label.
The top line with the tape number and association name will automatically print
with the information you entered earlier. Your name and address will also be
printed at the bottom of the label.
 
16. For each label you need to type in a line using the following format:
 
     Line number, the word DATA followed by the label number, the
     first line of copy, the second line of copy, a number for side 1 or
     side 2.
 
Example:   220 DATA 1,Main Seminar Address,Dr. John Hughes,1
           225 DATA 1,Closing Comments,Dr. John Hughes,2
 
17. I suggest that you use line number 5 number apart. ie 210, 215, 220 etc.
 
18. Before you start to type in the information you can make the line number
appear automatically by typing AUTO 210,5 and pressing ENTER.
 
19. The number 210* will appear on the screen. The * means that this line
already exists and you will be replacing it.
 
20. The information you type must conform to the following:
 
     1. Each line can contain up to 54 letters and spaces. If you
     exceed this number the program will tell you when you go to
     print.
 
     2. If any of the line contain a colon : the line must have
     quotations around it. EXAMPLE "KEYNOTE: Dr. Smith"
 
     3. You cannot use quotations marks as part of the titles.
     Instead use two apostrophe ''.
 
21. Line numbers cannot go above 1990. This is because there is more program
information above these line which cannot be erased.  If you need more line
numbers, then space them closer together.
 
22. The reason for using a spacing of 5 numbers between lines is in case you
need to insert an extra tape, you can put it in the proper order. However, it
does not matter what order you type in the tape numbers. It just makes it
easier for you to find later if you know they are in order.
 
23. Once you have finished typing in all of the label information, press CTRL C
this will break you out of the automatic line numbering.
 
24. Type SAVE "PROGRAM.BAS"   Replace the word PROGRAM with any 8 letters you
wish. Each time you create a new set of labels, start with the LABEL.BAS
program and give it a different name when you save it.
 
25. If something doesn't work right, check to see if you left out a comma or
quotation mark. REMEMBER, EACH LINE MUST HAVE THE WORD DATA FOLLOWED BY A
NUMBER AND A COMMA, FIRST LINE OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED BY A COMMA, SECOND LINE
OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED BY A COMMA, AND A SIDE NUMBER. If you only need one
line of information, then put two commas after that line.
 
     EXAMPLE:     210 DATA 1,Only One Line of Copy,,1

              INSTRUCTIONS FOR LABEL PROGRAM ON THE MODEL 100
 
1.  Assuming that LABEL.BA is already loaded in your computer, go into BASIC,
press the F2 button, type "LABEL" without the quote marks, and press the ENTER
key.  LABEL will now be loaded in the BASIC buffer.
 
2.  Type EDIT and press ENTER.
 
3.  The first time you use the program, you will want to customize it for your
own use, by including your customer's name or initials in Line 4.
 
4.  Scroll down so that line 4 appears on the screen.
 
5. Move the cursor to where the letters 'ABC' appear.  Place the cursor on the
letter C. Delete these letters by touching the backspace key key three times.
 
6. Now scroll down to line 15.
 
7. Where you see the words "TYPE IN YOUR NAME HERE" delete these words and
replace with your own company name. Do the same for the address.
 
IMPORTANT: Make sure your name and address appear within the quote marks.
 
8.  Now scroll down to line 150
 
9. Where you see the words TAPE FC- you can change this to whatever code you
use at the start of each tape number. The actually tape number will be printed
automatically. For example all of our conferences tapes start with a two letter
code. If the words TAPE FC- were left unchanged, the first label will print as
TAPE FC-1
 
10. Where you see the letters AACD, change these to read your client's name or
abbreviation letters.
 
11.  Now scroll down to line 210
 
The label program prints labels in the following format:
 
 
           TAPE FC-1                                           AACD
           FIRST LINE OF COPY (this line will automatically center)
           SECOND LINE OF COPY (this line will automatically center)
 
 
                     (this is the open hole in the label)
 
 
               YOUR NAME (this line will automatically center)
               YOUR ADDRESS (this line will automatically center)
 
 
12. Decide what you want to print on the first and second line of the label.
The top line with the tape number and association name will automatically print
with the information you entered earlier. Your name and address will also be
printed at the bottom of the label.
 
13. For each label to be printed, you need to type in a line using the
following format:
 
     A Line number, the word DATA followed by the label number, the
     first line of copy, the second line of copy, a number for side 1 or
     side 2.
 
Examples:   210 DATA 1,Main Seminar Address,Dr. John Hughes,1
            215 DATA 1,Closing Comments,Dr. John Hughes,2
 
You can also enclose the string data in quote marks, like this:
 
Examples:   210 DATA 1,"Main Seminar Address","Dr. John Hughes",1
            215 DATA 1,"Closing Comments","Dr. John Hughes",2
 
If you include a comma or colon in the string, you MUST use the quote marks to
signify they are part of the sting, and not part of the DATA statement.
 
14. I suggest that you use line numbers 5 number apart. ie 210, 215, 220 etc.
 
15. The information you type for each line must conform to the following:
 
     1. In order to print in compressed type on a dot matrix printer,
     Each line can only contain up to 54 letters and spaces. If you
     exceed this number the program will tell you when you go to print.
 
     2. If any of the lines contain a colon (:) the line must have
     quotations around it. EXAMPLE "KEYNOTE: Dr. Smith"
 
     3. You cannot use quotations marks as part of the titles. Instead use
     two apostrophes ''.
 
16. Program Line numbers cannot go above 1990. This is because there are more
program lines above these lines which cannot be erased. If you need more line
numbers, then space them closer together.
 
17. The reason for using a spacing of 5 numbers between lines is in case you
need to insert an extra tape, you can put it in the proper order. However, it
does not matter what order you type in the tape numbers. It just makes it
easier for you to find later if you know they are in order.
 
18. When you have finished typing in all of the label information, press F8.
This will take you out of the editing mode, and retokenize the program.
 
19. It is not necessary to "Save" the program again, as it has already been
rewritten when you came out of the edit buffer, and is now in the changed form.
 
I would suggest you save each changed copy of the program to disk, and mark the
disk with the client's name and date, for future reference, and in case you get
reorders at a later date.
 
20. If something doesn't work right, check to see if you left out a comma or
quotation mark in the DATA statements. REMEMBER, EACH LINE MUST HAVE THE WORD
DATA FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER AND A COMMA, FIRST LINE OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED BY A
COMMA, SECOND LINE OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED BY A COMMA, AND A SIDE NUMBER. If
you only need one line of information, then put two commas after that line.
 
     EXAMPLE:     210 DATA 1,Only One Line of Copy,,1
