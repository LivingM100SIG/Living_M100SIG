     PORTABLE CHECKBOOK is an easy-to-use menu driven program which can
 organize your entire home financial record keeping system. The program
 provides a monthly record and printed statement of each check written. You may
 record deposits and other noncheck transactions such as 24 hour teller machine
 withdrawals or service charges. Each monthly record can be saved along with
 the balance to a monthly file in RAM, cassette, DVI, or other appropriate mass
 storage device. A continous checkbook balance is always available. All
 transactions can be coded to provide different catagory expenses such as
 utility billings, automobile expenses, mortgage payments or donations. At
 years end you will have a record of all important tax transactions coded for
 quick reference. Most important is the ability of PORTABLE CHECKBOOK to print
 checks. You can easily design the program to fit your individual check system.
 You can use the personal checks you now have or purchase continous feed
 multi-part checks available through your bank or other commercial supplier.
      PORTABLE CHECKBOOK is offered as shareware. Please feel free to alter,
 change, modify, copy, trade, share or transfer PORTABLE CHECKBOOK provided the
 title screen remains unaltered and intact with the program. If you find the
 program of value, please send $15.00 to: THE SHANNON GROUP, RT. 2,BOX 162M,
 ROSWELL, NM 88201. Request a printed copy of the full documentation.

                          MAIN MENU-PORTABLE CHECKBOOK

      After a brief title screen, if the file "CKDATA.DO" is not already
 present in RAM or is not configured correctly, the program will create a new
 file and begin questioning you for information data to fill it. Turn to the
 section titled "8. CONFIGURE CKDATA.DO" in the latter part of this
 documentation to help answer the questions. If the file already exists, you
 will be taken directly to the program main menu. After CKBOOK's main menu
 appears, pressing any number (pressing <ENTER> is not required) will take you
 to the appropriate portion of the program.

 1. ENTER DATA
      Though not required, depressing the CAPS LOCK is the best method for
 entering data since searches are case sensitive. IMPORTANT: Do not use commas
 in any entries. 

 A) AMOUNT: Begin entering data in the AMOUNT space. Always enter positive
 numbers. If you enter more than $99999.99 in the space, the computer will BEEP
 and start over. After you have entered the correct amount, press <ENTER>, and
 you will be tabbed to the DATE position. If you make a mistake before pressing
 <ENTER>, you may "backspace" and correct your error. However, if you have
 moved on in the Menu and discover an error in a previous line, you will have
 to restart by first pressing function key 1 and then <ENTER>. This will clear
 the screen and redisplay the ENTER DATA menu. The previously interrupted data
 will not be stored. This applies to all the data entry positions.

 B) DATE(MM/DD/YY): To use the current date, press <ENTER>, and the program
 will display the date and move to the next line. For a date other than the
 current one, enter the date in the MM/DD/YY format. 

 C) PAYEE: Enter the PAYEE in this line using no more than 34 spaces. 

 D) ADDRESS: Enter the address using no more than 22 spaces. Do not use any
 commas in any entries. If you do not need to record the address, skip this
 line and the CITY line by pressing <ENTER> before entering any data.

 E) CITY:-STATE:-ZIP: Enter the CITY line using no more than 15 spaces.
 Pressing <ENTER> will tab you to the STATE position.  These three positions
 will be skipped if you pressed <ENTER> before entering any data in the
 previous ADDRESS line.

 F) PURPOSE: Use up to 23 spaces to describe any explanation of the
 transaction. 

 G) CODE: You are given 5 spaces to provide an appropriate abbreviated code of
 your own chosing. If you want this entry to be printed later as a check, the
 first character must be a "/" symbol. If the transaction amount is to be added
 to the balance such as a deposit, then the first entry in the CODE line must
 be a "$" symbol. All amounts without a "$" symbol are subtracted from the
 balance. Code entries without the "/" symbol are used for hand written checks,
 service charges, or other non-check transactions that are not printed. Because
 the first position may be occupied by a "/" or a "$",it is best to utilize
 less than 5 alpha-numeric characters.

 H) CHECK NUMBER: If you have used a "/" to indicate a record that will later
 print as a check, the program will be ask for a STARTING CHECK #. Input any
 starting number. All succeeding records entered during this session with "/"
 in the code line will be assigned the next number without prompting you for a
 number. On all other code entries without a "/" symbol, you are prompted for a
 CHECK NUMBER. You may enter a number or press <ENTER> without making an entry.
 All entries to be printed during the check writing routine must be continous
 check numbers.  When the display clears, the record is stored in the file
 CKFILE.DO and a new DATA ENTRY screen is displayed. If you wish to quit, press
 <ENTER> in the "AMOUNT:" line before typing a new entry. 

 2. BALANCE
      Pressing the number "2" will give the account balance on the screen
 contained in the RAM file CKFILE.DO. 

 3. SAVE CKFILE TO (CAS) (CAS is used for this example)
      This routine will allow you to save the RAM file called CKFILE.DO to any
 appropriate mass storage device. Typical mass storage devices such as the  DVI
 or a cassette recorder may be used.

 4. PRINT CHECKS
      After several setup questions,the program will ask "PRINT CHECK STARTING
 WITH ? NUMBER". Input the check number of the record marked earlier with the
 symbol "/" that you wish to begin. If for instance, early in the month you
 printed checks 36-48 and in the second session of the month you wish to print
 a second round, enter the number 49. After the start number is entered, the
 program will begin printing checks in succession. 

 5. PRINT CKFILE
      At any time you may print out the contents of the CKFILE.DO file and have
 a permanent record of all monthly transactions. Print this file to review all
 entries before printing checks to spot any entry errors. If your review finds
 any errors, the corrections can only be made by entering CKFILE.DO from the
 computer's main menu via TEXT and correcting the offending digit(s)! BE
 CAREFUL THAT YOU DO NOT ALTER ANY COMMAS OR OTHER DATA.

 6. SEARCH DATA
      You can search through all or selected months of the files contained in
 your mass storage device. The search fields are numbered: 0-All Entries,
 1-Payee, 2-Address, 3-City, 4-State, 5-Zip, 6-Purpose, 7-Code, 8-Date,
 9-Amount, and <ENTER> for Check #. After responding to the setup prompts, you
 are asked "SELECT DATA BASED ON ?". Press the appropriate number to select the
 search field. Unless your entry is "0" or ALL ENTRIES, you are asked to "ENTER
 SEARCH STRING". Enter any search criteria. The print out will contain those
 records which match your search string.

 7. KILL OLD CKFILE-CREATE NEW CKFILE WITH BALANCE
      If CKFILE.DO exists in RAM, this routine will take the ending balance
 from it, KILL the old file and create a new CKFILE.DO using the prior ending
 balance as the as the first entry. If no prior file exists, the new file will
 have $0.00 entered as the beginning balance. This is a good way to establish a
 new CKFILE.DO when none exists. Enter the file directly from the computer's
 main menu to change the starting balance amount if other than $0.00. Every
 CKFILE.DO must have an initial "OLD BALANCE" entry and amount even if  $0.00

 8. CONFIGURE CKDATA.DO
      The file CKDATA.DO contains all the information to identify your mass
 storage device and print the checks to your own design. If this file is not
 present, the program will create one. Pressing "8" will create a new CKDATA
 file and all previous data in that file will be lost.
      The first question is "ENTER CHECK LENGTH (# OF LINES)?". The number you
 enter indicates the number of lines on the check page. Since the normal
 spacing is 6 lines per inch, a 3 and 1/2 inch long check will have 21 lines
 per check etc. You may use any check length. The second question is "HOW MANY
 2 OR 3 FIELD LINES?" Some lines of your printed check may require more than
 one piece of information such as a line containing the City, State, and Zip (a
 3 part field line). Or perhaps you might require a line with both the amount
 and date printed on it (a 2 part field line). Your answer should be the total
 number of lines containing both 2 or 3 part fields.
      The next question asks for the 3 letter abbreviation used to represent
 the mass storage device such as CAS for a cassette or DVI. The entry is used
 for LCD screen display purposes only. The next question asks for the symbol
 used to call the mass storage device from basic.  Examples are CAS: for
 cassette or 0: for the DVI.
      The next set of questions pertains to the fields to be printed on each
 line of the check and the indentation from the left margin. The fields are
 numbered and defined as: (1) PAYEE, (2) ADDRESS, (3) CITY, (4) STATE, (5) ZIP,
 (6) PURPOSE, (7) CODE, (8) DATE, (9) AMOUNT (numeric), (10) CHECK #, (11)
 AMOUNT (spelled out), (12) 1st 2 or 3 part field line, (13) 2nd 2 or 3 part
 field line, (14) 3rd 2 or 3 part field line etc. The questions will come in
 pairs and will ask 2 questions for each line of the check: "FOR LINE n ENTER
 FIELD #?" and "INDENT TAB LENGTH?". The questions will repeat until you have
 progressed through all the number of lines for the check length that you
 previously answered. If any lines of your check will be blank, respond to the
 two questions with zero. If the first line of the check is to contain the
 date, enter 8 for the first question for line 1 and respond with the number of
 spaces the printing should begin from the left margin for the second question.
 If the eighth line of the check is to contain both the PAYEE and the numeric
 AMOUNT on the same line enter the number 12 (if you have defined it this way
 in the next set of questions below) in response to "FOR LINE 8 ENTER FIELD
 #?". If the printing is to start on the 10th space from the left, respond with
 10 for the 2nd question pair. Continue until you have stepped through all the
 pairs of questions defining the entries for each line of the check.  
      The last set of questions defines the multi-field (2 or 3 part) lines.
 Five sets of question will be asked and repeated for the  number you entered
 in answer to the previous question "HOW MANY 2 OR 3 FIELD LINES?". The first
 question asks for the field # of the 1st entry to be printed; the second
 question, the number of spaces between the 1st field # and the 2nd field #;
 the third question, the 2nd field # to be printed; the fourth question, the
 number of spaces between the 2nd and 3rd field #; and the fifth question asks
 for the # of the 3rd field to be printed on the same line. The first set of
 questions defines multi-field line #12. Succeeding questions define fields
 #13, #14, etc. From the previous paragraph, if you defined line 8 to print
 field #12 (to print the PAYEE and AMOUNT on the same line), your responses to
 the multi-field questions might be 1:7:9:0:0. This says that field #1 is the
 PAYEE, with 7 spaces between it and the #9 AMOUNT field. Since there is no
 third field printed, zeros are used to represent the spacing and the last
 field response. If a line is to contain the CITY STATE and ZIP then your
 response to the question set might be 3:2:4:2:5; placing two spaces between
 each of the field entries. Each succeeding set of entries defines field #13,
 #14 etc. for as many multi-field line entries as you need.
