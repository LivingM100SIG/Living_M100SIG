          DOCUMENTATION FOR DBFIX.DVI
          
          
          DBFIX.DVI is a short file which should be downloaded as an ascii 
          file and then merged with the program DBNEW from DL2. It allows 
          access to database files on the DVI from within the DBNEW 
          program. It does not run the database from disk, but merely 
          allows you to load a file into RAM from within the program 
          rather than having to load the file first, then run the program. 
          
          After downloading the file and mergeing it with DBNEW, when you 
          next run DBNEW you will find that the program will display the 
          files on disk, list the available space on disk, and on the 
          following line show the files in RAM. 
          
          A file can be loaded either from RAM or from the disk. If 
          loading from the disk, the file should be entered in the format 
          0:NAME.EXT. The extension should be 3 characters long, otherwise 
          you get funny things happening with the name of the file in RAM. 
          This could be fixed, but I find it easier just to use 3 
          character extensions. If loading from a file already in RAM, the 
          filename should be typed in without the extension. When you hit 
          enter, DBNEW loads the file to RAM from disk, then runs as it 
          normally does. The only difference that really exists within the 
          program is that the default print device is the CRT rather than 
          the LCD. Note that they have changed positions. CRT is now 
          function key 1, and LCD is function key 4. 
          
          When you hit 5 to return to the Model 100 menu you will be asked 
          if you want another file. You will then be asked if you want the 
          existing file erased from RAM. A "Y" or a "y" will initiate the 
          appropriate response. Any other key is a negative response. 
          If you have answered yes to another file, then the program 
          starts over at the top, lists the files on disk and RAM and you 
          choose from there. 
          
          It's not a major enhancement to the program, and is not terribly 
          elegant. My programming abilities are negligible. But it does 
          provide a bit more ease when using DBNEW with the DVI. It has 
          not been designed to be compatible with POWR-DOS, and in fact 
          doesn't work with it, though that may be easy to correct. I 
          haven't checked it out with POWR-DISK yet. It won't work with 
          the DVI and a screen 0 setting because of the PRINT@ addresses 
          that I've used for positioning things on the CRT. Obviously that 
          could be fixed as well, but my main concern was for using it 
          with the CRT. I'm not sure what happens on a 2 disk DVI since 
          mine is only one. Would love to hear any feedback and guidance, 
          since this is my first attempt to try and do something useful.
