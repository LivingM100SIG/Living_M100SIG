This program was written originally for an ADAM computer to process address lables.  It is completely menu driven.  It provides the following functions:

	1  Build an Address list

	2  Edit an existing address list

	3  Print the addresses on paper in paged formatt

	4  Selectively print addresses on standard lables

The program does not have a sort.  Maybe someone can add that.

The checksum is 412,699 using downck.

I'd appreciate feedback via cis on your experiences or improvements.
