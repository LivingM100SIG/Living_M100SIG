                                Information Presented

          This screen shows one of the to-dos from the warehouse at a time
          (unassigned to-dos are excluded).  Along with the description,
          the screen shows the priority and the stress grade.


                                      Functions

          There are four functions available on screen 7:


             # Cycle [F1].  Move on to the next item in the warehouse.

             # Do [F3].  Move the displayed to-do to the daily list and
               display the next to-do in the warehouse.

             # Delete [F5].  Remove the displayed to-do from the warehouse.

             # Reset.  Press [Down-Arrow] to move all items in the daily
               list back to the warehouse.


          If at any time the warehouse becomes empty, the text-display area
          will become blank; after that, the function keys do nothing. 
          Remember, "empty" here excludes unassigned to-dos.

                                Information Presented

          This screen shows the number of to-dos in the daily list.  It
          divides them into stress categories, since your allocation of
          daily work should be based on these stress values.


                                      Functions

          This is a "corridor" screen - all you can do from it is exit to
          other screens.


                                        Exits

          Pressing [Up-Arrow] moves to screen 5, where you can inspect the
          numbers of appointments and to-dos in the task file.  Pressing
          [Right-Arrow] moves to screen 9, where you can add an item for
          the current date.  When you enter screen 9 from screen 8, the
          item you add will always be at the top of its section.  Pressing
          [Down-Arrow] moves to screen 11, where you can process the to-dos
          in the daily list individually.  Pressing [Left-Arrow] moves to
          screen 7, where you can select to-dos from the warehouse for the
          daily list.

                                Information Presented

          This screen displays the selected item from screen 6, along with
          its major attribute - the warning and the warning type.  If the
          item is a repeating-date item, the lower right corner of the
          screen will indicate which type.  If you enter screen 9 from
          screen 8, there will be no item indicated on the text-display
          area.


                                      Functions

          There are four major functions of this screen:


             # You can use the Model 100's TEXT program to insert new
               items, modify the existing item, or delete the existing
               item.  Press [Down-Arrow] to move into the "text" block, and
               TMPC will activate the TEXT program.  You can edit the
               existing text (if any); you can add new items by separating
               them with the [ENTER] key; you can delete the existing item. 
               When done, press [F8] to return to the screen.

             # You can change the warning period by pressing [Down-Arrow]
               to enter the "warning" box.  A cursor will flash in the
               small box; type in the new number.  When done, press
               [ENTER], and the stick-figure will move out of the box.  If
               you type in an illegal number (not 0 - 999), TMPC will beep
               and the warning will be set to 0.

             # You can change the type of warning from "c" to "b".  Press
               [Down-Arrow] into the "warning type" box to alternate
               between the type of warning.

             # You can make the entry a fixed-date item, a weekly-repeating
               item or a monthly-repeating item.  Press [Down-Arrow] into
               the box over the type of the item to change them.


                                        Exits

          Two exits are always available from this screen.  Pressing
          [Up-Arrow] moves to screen 6, where you can view the current
          date's items and select another for manipulation.  Pressing
          [Left-Arrow] moves to screen 8, which resets the current date to
          today and displays the number of to-dos in the daily list.

          If the item is a repeating item, there will be an exit on the
          right side of the screen.  Press [Right-Arrow] to move to screen
          13 (for weekly repeating items) or screen 14 (for monthly
          repeating items).

                                Information Presented

          This screens shows the movement factor for the stick-figure, the
          destination device (LCD or LPT) for a task-file listing, whether
          the diary feature is active or inactive, and the name of the
          current task file.


                                      Functions

          This screen performs four loosely related tasks:


             # Change the stick-figure character.  Pressing [Down-Arrow]
               over the leftmost block will cycle between "walk", "run",
               and "fly". Choice is a matter of personal preference.

             # Change the stick-figure character.  Pressing [Down-Arrow]
               over the second block from the left will accept the next
               character you type as the cursor to move through the rooms.

             # Select and deselect the diary.  If the diary is deselected,
               any entries to be made to it will be lost.  Press
               [Down-Arrow] into the box over "Diary" to toggle the feature
               on and off.

             # Select a task file.  Press [Down-Arrow] into the rightmost
               box.  The screen will clear, and the prompt "Task File
               Name?" will appear.  If the entry is valid, screen 10 will
               reappear with the new task file indicated.  If you specify a
               new file name, an "empty" task file will be created for you.

                                Information Presented

          Upon entering this screen, the first to-do in the daily list will
          appear.  If the daily list is empty, the text-display area will
          be blank.  Along with the description in the text-display area,
          the stress-grade and priority (for reference only) appear as
          well.


                                      Functions

          There are four things you can do with the to-do displayed on the
          screen:


             # Cycle past it [F1].  Move to the next item in the daily
               list.

             # Register it as done [F3].  Remove it from the daily list;
               when the diary is updated, add it with the notation "C" for
               "completed".

             # Register it as canceled [F5].  Remove it from the daily
               list; when the diary is updated, add it with the notation
               "X" for "canceled".

             # Defer it [F7].  Move it back to the warehouse; no entry is
               made in the diary.


          In addition, pressing [F8] will print a list of the items in the
          daily list to the line printer.

          move to screen 8, where you can see how many items remain in the
          daily list.  Pressing [Left-Arrow] will move to screen 10, where
          you can do miscellaneous functions with files.  Pressing

                                       Purpose

          This screen acts as a corridor to TMPC expansion modules.  These
          are software programs that enhance TMPC capabilities; consult
          Acroatix for availability.


                                Information Presented

          If there are no expansion modules present in memory, the screen
          will show a "dead end" corridor.  Otherwise, the screen will show
          the name of the current expansion option in position.  Think of
          this screen as an elevator which moves to different floors.  Each
          expansion module continues the floor plan on its own floor; this
          screen shows which floor you are on.


                                      Functions

          If there are more than one expansion module in memory, pressing
          [Right-Arrow] will select the module to execute, much as
          changing floors in an elevator.


                                        Exits

          There are two possible exits from this screen.  Pressing
          [Left-Arrow] moves to screen 11.  Pressing [Down-Arrow] moves
          into the expansion module.

          [Ed. Note: As of 10/88 there have been no expansion modules made
          available by Acroatix]

                                Information Presented

          This screen shows the weeks of a month on which the repeating
          item occurs.  Note that more than one week can be indicated, by
          the "x" in the corresponding box.  Also, each day of the week is
          individually indicated.  All of the indicated days and weeks are
          combined for the repeating action; for example, if "first week"
          and "third week", "Monday" and "Thursday" were all indicated, the
          item would repeat on Mondays and Thursdays during the first and
          third weeks of every month.  You may have to create more than one
          repeating-entry item for some combinations of dates, such as the
          first Monday and the fourth Friday of every month.


                                      Functions

          You can move the stick figure to any of the weeks or weekdays;
          pressing [Up-Arrow] into the boxes will toggle the weeks
          ([Down-Arrow] for days) on and off.  You can specify the "last"
          week of a month, which could be either the fourth or fifth week.


                                        Exit

          The only exit is to screen 9, where you can modify the warning or
          the description of the item.  If the changes you made to the
          repeating item are such that the current date no longer falls on
          the repeating date, the current date will move forward to the
          first occurrence of the repeating date.  If you exit the screen
          with no weeks (or no weekdays) specified, the repeating date will
          return to whatever it was when you entered the screen.
