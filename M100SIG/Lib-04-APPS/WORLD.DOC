* Numbers in parentheses (+30) indicate +30 minutes (for countries on off-hour
times), for example if the time in Israel (zone 14) is 9AM then the time in
Moscow (zone 15) is 10AM and in Iran (zone 15) it's 10:30AM.



The time zone system is based on the division of the world into 24 hours or
time zones by 24 meridians placed 15 longitude degrees apart.

One time zone is split into two separate zones by the IDL, designated in this
program as Zone 24 on the west side of the IDL, and Zone 0 on the east side of
the IDL.  The times in each of these two zones is the same, except that Zone 24
is the next day. (On crossing the IDL going to the west the date is advanced
 one day.)

While the International Date Line is symbollically represented as a straight
line, a glance at any world map shows in reality a zig-zag configuration. The
IDL was to originally have been aligned with the 180th degree meridian, but
segments were shifted in accordance with practical considerations for
individual countries/island groups.  For example, the eastern-most portion of
Russia (the USSR traverses 11 time zones) is traversed by the 180th degree
meridian, which would have placed adjoining regions at the same time on
different days - hence, the creation of Zone 25 to keep the entire country west
of the IDL, by shifting a segment of the IDL eastward to the Bering Strait.

The time in Zone 25 is the same as that in Zone 1, except Zone 25 is the next
day, being on the opposite side of the IDL.

As can readily be seen, the difference in hours between any 2 time zones can be
determined at a glance by simply subtracting any two zone numbers.  For
example, when it's 2AM in Hawaii in Zone 2 then it's 7AM in New York in Zone 7,
and 2100 (9PM) in Tokyo in Zone 21.
