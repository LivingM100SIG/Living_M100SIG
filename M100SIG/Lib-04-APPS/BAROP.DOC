 Option # 1 
                                     BEER 

 Will list to LCD: 
           Glasses per 1/2 
           Gross $ per 1/2 
           Net   $ per 1/2 
           Gross $ for x number of 1/2 's 
           Net   $ for x number of 1/2 's 

      Will  open  & list to Ram File BEER.DO the  glass oz entered @ the price 
 entered * the number of half barrels entered & the net $ realized. 

 To utilize this program, we'll assume you want to  know  the  difference,  of 
 changing from an 8 oz glass to a 7 oz glass or should you raise your prices? 

 ex: you sell 20 halves a week; use a 8 oz glass & charge .45 per glass. 
 Following prompts - enter appropiate data ("Size of Glass (oz)?" enter 8; etc 
 - BEER.DO will then show '8 oz @ .45 glass * 20 halves = $1720' 

 Run  again  -  At prompt for "Size of Glass (oz)?" - this time enter 7, & the 
 same data as for price, cost, etc. 

 - BEER.DO will then show '7 oz @ .45 glass * 20 halves = $2040' 

      If considering a price increase just enter the proper data  -  you  will 
 understand  the program after a few trial runs. The program has no LPT output 
 (RAM saver) as Shift/Print from text (BEER.DO) will print the formatted info. 

 This procedure also used for "Whisky Compare" 

 There are no provisions for  the  'head'  on  a  beer,  as  this  is  just  a 
 comparison  -  but  remember  - when considering (x) oz's for 'head' you must 
 then consider (x) oz's for 'bartenders run-off'! It has  been  my  expierence 
 that these two variables will offset each other 


 Option # 2 
                                    WHISKY 


 Will list to LCD "Shots (portions per Btl)" 
           Gross $ per Btl 
           Net   $ per Btl 
           Gross $ for x num. of Btl's 
           Net   $ for x num  of Btl's 

      Will  open  &  list  to Ram File WHISKY.DO the portion (oz) served @ the 
 price * number of Btl's = Net $ realized 

 Again, a few trial runs & you will have it. Same LPT as BEER. 














                             *** SPECIAL NOTE *** 

 Spelling of whisky / whiskey - 

      Imported  = whisky 
      Domestic  = whiskey 
      Exception = Irish Whiskey 
      Example   = Seagrams 7  = whiskey (USA) 
                  Seagrams VO = whisky (CAN) 

 OK, go look at your VO & Sea. 7 bottles! 

 I used the imported spelling because 6 letters = Ram file name. 



                                  OPTION # 3 

      Will give you the price to charge for one hi-ball or cocktail  per  your 
 desired   bar   cost   or   profit  %  desired.  Just  follow  prompts,  read 
 explanations, & round up or down to determine selling price per drink.
