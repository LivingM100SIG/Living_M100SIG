ROCKT2.BA
---------


ROCKT2 solves the basic equation for a single stage rocket in the 
absence of drag and gravity. It is intended to facilitate exploration 
of the effects of varying initial weight in orbit (W0,Lb), final 
weight in orbit (WF,Lb), and delta V (V,ft/sec) requirement/
capability. The user can also vary the other important parameter, 
specific impulse (ISP,sec).

The user can select from a menu for three output options: 1) printer, 
2) Model 100 screen, and 3) ram file. A main menu offers options to 
calculate: 1) Delta V capability (based on Isp, initial weight, and 
final weight); 2) Initial weight required (based on Isp, final weight,
and delta V required); 3) Final weight capability (based on Isp, 
initial weight, and delta V required).

Each of the three submenus offers the options to iterate on the 
independent variables (except Isp). For example, when calculating 
delta V, the submenu offers the opportunity to vary W0 or WF.

The user is also allowed the opportunity to return to the main menu or
to quit. The main menu provides the option to explore the effects of 
varying Isp as well as selecting other submenus.

Output may be to: 1) printer, 2) Model 100 screen, and 3) ram file. 
Prompts are provided to the user on the screen  to aid in iteration 
regardless of output option selected.

I wrote ROCKT2 to simplify response to recurring technical questions 
and as a learning experience for one who is barely computer literate. 
I know it has rough edges and could be both more efficient and 
convenient.

If it is helpful to you, please consider ROCKT2 a modest contribution 
to public domain software.
