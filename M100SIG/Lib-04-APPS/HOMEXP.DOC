III. Notes:  The Home Expense Program can also be used as a
     Checkbook Balancer by assigning all checks a unique Bill
     Category number. All deposits are then + values, and check
     amounts must be prefaced by a -. The running total will 
     display the current balance.
 
     A serial printer can be used with the program by changing
     lines 1480 to COM and the appropriate parameters.
