  CkSum = 99,059 

  Just a bare bones inventory program. Includes bells whistles, etc. 

  Will work on the M100 or M200 

  Merges  welcomed  &  requested. This is in response to a members request for 
  same. Not knowing the needs of specific users,  I  thought  to  just  upload 
  this would be of some help 


  Modus Operandi as is: 



  * Use prpmpt #2 (ADD) to start program 


  Use Break/Pause key to stop scrolling of: 

            1. DISPLAY INVENTORY prompt 
            2. UPDATE  INVENTORY promtpt 
            3. Hit ENTER any time program stops 
                  a. This was an intentional to keep LCD clear 
                  in case anyone wanted to use the Shift/Print function 


  Useful options, if needed, to be added: 

            1. Hardcopy (sub-routine) 
            2. PrintUsing capabilities [for Inv. Amt(s)] 
            3. Disk Access - for INVDTA.do file, etc 
            4. Full date, ie, 11/15/87 (To include year extension) 

  ***  Programs  lines  -  start@  20  -  increments  of  20  for your ease of 
  customizing
