          Now you can see clearly that TMPC does not automatically sort
          appointments: a 2:30 meeting shows up before a lunch date.
          However, Tom quickly solves this problem with the "cut and paste"
          feature.  He presses [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to
          "cut" the meeting; note that a "p" now appears, and that the
          next item is selected:

          [Ed. Note: The example will work properly if you "cut" the 11:45
          meeting and "paste" it BEFORE the 2:30 meeting, instead of
          cutting the 2:30 meeting. (information from supplemental error
          sheet)]


          He then presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to select
          the J.A. meeting; then, he pastes in the Synquil meeting before
          it by pressing [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] [Left-Arrow].  The changes
          are now complete:

          The tutorial format makes these changes seem cumbersome, but with
          a little practice, you will be able to reschedule appointments
          with very little difficulty.


                            Adding Multiple Appointments

          Tom gets a call from his friend Mike.  They and several other
          friends have formed a syndication to buy a set of baseball season
          tickets.  "We know the dates of your games", he says.  Tom enters
          TMPC and presses [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to move
          into the "add appointment" screen.  He presses [Down-Arrow] and
          enters "Mets Game" in TEXT, then presses [F8].  He is entering
          the games as "memo" - that is, without any times - because the
          times vary, and are usually in the evening anyway.

          He presses [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] [Up-Arrow] to move into the
          appointment list:

                            Lesson 3: Time Related Items

          Tom entered the baseball game for "today", for convenience.  He
          now cuts the memo from today by pressing [Right-Arrow].  "When is
          the first game?" he asks.  "June 14th", Mike answers, and begins
          a long list of dates, about 12 in all.  For each one, Tom follows
          the same procedure:


             # He selects the date in the calendar screen.

             # He moves to the day's appointment list.

             # He presses [Left-Arrow] to "paste the memo"


          You can use the cut and paste feature to duplicate appointments
          as well as rearrange them.  However, there is one important
          warning: if you move ANYWHERE besides the calendar or the
          appointment list screens, whatever you cut will be lost for good.
          You can use this feature to delete appointments, but take care,
          or you may delete on unintentionally.

          Once all the memos are added, Tom discusses with Mike the
          futility of attending Mets games and eventually returns to his
          work.


                              Adding a Business Holiday

          Tom's boss sticks his head into the office.  "If you want to go
          skiing this weekend, it's fine with me and Rick says OK, too", he
          says.  "just make sure that the presentations won't be affected".
          Tom had asked for Monday off so he could visit some friends in
          Vermont.

          "That won't be a problem", Tom says confidently as he enters
          TMPC.  He presses [Right-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] and sets the date
          to next Monday.  Then, he presses [ENTER] [Down-Arrow]
          [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to move into
          TEXT, enters "Vacation", presses [F8], then presses 
          [Right-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] to set the warning to
          "Bday".

          Any item with a warning of "0 Bdays" is a business holiday.  You
          have already seen how TMPC skips weekends in figuring
          business-day deadlines; it will skip business holidays as well. 
          While Tom's boss is still there, he looks at today's appointment
          list again by pressing  [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow]
          [Up-Arrow] [Right-Arrow].  The detour to the status screen resets
          the current date to today.  Tom then presses [Right-Arrow] to
          move to the second pate, where the deadlines are.  There is
          nothing critical.  "Yep - no problem at all", he says.


                               Days Between Two Dates

          As Tom is working, an associate sticks his head in the office. 
          "Say Tom", he says with a leer, "you have that jiffy little
          computer - can you use it for me for a sec?"

          Tom isn't sure whether to be patronizing or contemptuous, but he
          says diplomatically, "sure", what do you want?"

          "We were talking about the Janbel contract, and we want to know
          how many days are left before November 30, when it's due", is the
          reply.  Without answering immediately, Tom enters TMPC and
          presses  [Right-Arrow] [Right-Arrow] to set the current date. 
          He moves to November 30 by pressing [CTRL+Right-Arrow]
          [SHIFT+Left-Arrow] [SHIFT+Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow]
          [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow].  Then, he presses
          [ENTER], then  [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow] [Down-Arrow]
          [Down-Arrow].  Once in TEXT, he puts a memo, "days before
          November 30", presses [F8], then puts a warning of "365 Bdays" on
          it.  The number 365 is large enough to make the warning visible
          for over a year before November 30.  Then, he moves back to
          today's appointment list using the detour in the example above. 
          He finds the memo, and announces to his associate the number of
          business days in the warning:

          Tom subtracts a day for his ski vacation, since this does not
          apply to the Janbel contract. "That's the number of business
          days", Tom adds dryly, "but maybe you'd better know the number of
          calendar days, too, since you'll probably be working every
          weekend until then."

          As a last step, Tom "cuts" the memo, then leaves TMPC.

          We can only encourage you to experiment with the calendar
          capabilities of TMPC.  You will discover many shortcuts and
          tricks by experimentation, many of which we intentionally built
          in.  Once you finish the lessons, the Reference Section is a good
          starting point for your experimentation.
