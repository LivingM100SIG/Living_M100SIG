Documentation to programs PSEUDO.HEX and PSEUDO.MAC.

The program Psuedo performs the same functions that ADDRSS and SCHEDL do, while 
allowingyou to enter new information as you run the program.  Also, you are not
limited to just using ADRS.DO and NOTE.DO.

To run, load PSEUDO.HEX using HEXLDR.100.  PSEUDO.HEX is in Intel format hex 
code.  You can name the resulting .CO file anything you wish.  Run it, and enter
the name of a .DO file that has information you would like to search, etc.  
FIND, LFND and MENU work just like ADDRSS.   ADD allows you to add new 
information to the file, without having to go to TEXT and then back to ADDRSS.

I hope that this brief explanation, along with running the program, will be 
enough to help you get started.

I haven't had any problems with this program, but if you do, let me know.
