   I recently combined two of Tony Anderson's CRDFIL series programs,
CRDFIL.BAS and CRDTMP.BAS, into one. I believe the resultant program is much
more user friendly. Therefore, I thought I might make it available for all you
CRDFIL addicts out there (you know who you are, don't you?).

1} This is the first, and most important step. If you don't already have one,
make a back up copy of CRDFIL and CRDTMP and save them, just in case you mess
this one up.

2} Download CRDMRG.BAS as CRDMRG.DO and delete all the unecessary junk at the
beginning and end of the file.

3} Next, enter BASIC and type LOAD"CRDFIL. At the OK prompt, type
MERGE"CRDMRG. If everything was done correctly, you can now run CRDFIL. When
your choice is to <C>reate a new file, the screen will clear and you should get
the opening screen of CRDTMP. Following the creation of your new template your
screen should clear again and you should enter the input phase of CRDFIL as
before.

The instructions for using the CRDTMP portion of the program are included in
the first 32 lines of the original CRDTMP.BAS. If you need to refer to
them, you can do what I did. Convert CRDTMP.BAS to ASCII, or a DO file, by
typing in basic LOAD"CRDTMP. Then at the OK prompt type SAVE"CRDTMP",A. Once
the DO file has been established, and using the F7, F6, and paste keys,
separate the instructions into a separate file with a name of your own
choosing.

Good luck.
