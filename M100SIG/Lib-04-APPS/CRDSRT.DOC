                        CRDSRT.BA v3.0
                      ------------------

     Version 3.0 is a complete re-write of CRDSRT.BA; at 2139 bytes it is 150 
bytes smaller, faster and it supports Disk based data files! This program lets 
you completely sort CRDFIL cards by any priority of Prompt fields. It is easy 
to use and fully compatible with the 100/102 or the 200.
    Please read ALL these instructions before using CRDSRT. They're not 
complicated but they ARE necessary.
    There are only two limitations to CRDSRT's use:
 
     1> The total combined length of each "card's" data fields PLUS the number 
of prompts cannot exceed 253. Example: 8 prompts/fields with 31 characters in 
EACH field would be 256; (8+8x31=256) TOO BIG: but 7 fields with 31 char. each 
and 1 with 28 would be OK; (8+7x31+1x28=253). (That's a full M100 screen but 
half a T200's.)
         CRDSRT has two routines to check card length: one to use before you 
sort and the other monitors the assembly of the "sort" file and gently aborts 
the program (with NO data loss) and displays 210 bytes of the offending card if
your sort file contains one you didn't remember. Ifyou find a card that's too 
big you'll have to edit your card info before you re-run CRDSRT against that 
file.

     2> You must have FREE RAM available for use of at least 3500 bytes with 
CRDSRT in RAM, PLUS the size of your data file when using a Disk based file; 
3500 PLUS TWICE the size of your data file if sorting a file in RAM.



		- SET-UP -

     With these limitations in mind, here's how to begin. Download CRDSRT.DOC (
this file) & CRDSRT.BA.  M100/102 users also download SORTHI.100 this DL. T200 
users will need SORTHI.RT2 from DL10. EDIT the garbage and checksum them as .DO
files. SAVE a .BA copy of CRDSRT to RAM.
     RUN SORTHI.100 or SORTHI.RT2 as appropriate. SORTHI.100 will create 
SORTHI.CO for the 100 and SORTHI.RT2 will create SORTH1.CO for the 200. Each of
these .CO files MUST be loaded in their respective machines whenever you run 
CRDSRT.BA.
     If you'll be sorting Disk based data files you must have your disk loaded,
the drive on and a DOS installed that is "ON" and which recognizes "0:" 
commands.



		- OPERATION -

     When you run CRDSRT.BA you will first be prompted <D>isk  <R>am. Here you 
will choose the source of your data file. Pressing "D" will display your disk 
files and insert a "0:" for you. If you press "R" RAM files will display. 
     Enter the name of the file in either instance WITHOUT prefix with or 
without extension. You will then be prompted to check the file's data length. 
I'ld recommend that you always respond "Y" the first time you process any data 
file if your cards contain a lot of data. As mentioned above, a card that's too
long won't cause any data loss but can be frustrating.
     (When this "check" routine runs, you will see the first card that CRDSRT 
finds that exceeds 253 characters and the program ends. If all OK then re-run 
CRDSRT; ,otherwise you'll have to edit your data file before re-running.)

     Your current prompts will be then display with an "ID <n>" next to each. 
You can sort your cards by any field priority you choose and YOU create this 
sort priority by entering the ID <n>'s in the priority you wish the cards to be
sorted.
     For example: if your cards have 5 prompts the screen will display <1>
prompt1 <2>prompt2 etc. through <5>. 
     If you wanted to sort them by 4 3 2 1 5 priority that's how you would 
enter their ID <n>'s. Type 4, press ENTER; type 3, press ENTER etc. As you 
enter the field numbers they will display above the prompt line. If you should 
make a mistake simply press ENTER and the original sequence will re-display; 
start again. (Be sure to enter ALL the prompt ID <n>'s.)
     If you only wanted to sort them by field 5 then your sequence might look 
like this: 5 1 2 3 4. After you enter the last number you will see your prompts
redisplayed in your new "sorting" priority. If it's OK press Y and CRDSRT will 
go to work; if NOT OK then press any other key and the "original" prompts will 
re-display and you can start again. (CRDSRT will BEEP and reject any 0; any 
number that exceeds the number of prompts; or any combination of numbers that 
would indicate the duplication or omission of a prompt ID <n>.)
     CRDSRT will then show the card numbers as they are being prepared, print 
out your "sorting" file to SRT***.DO, call SORTHI.CO/SORTH1.CO to do the 
sorting, and return to CRDSRT to reprint your cards' data in their original 
format BUT with the cards sorted in their new priority. Please be patient when 
running large files. Sorting is M/L fast but re-writing a 5K file will take 1-2
minutes.
     Your cards will be sorted by their "ASCII line value". If you left spaces 
at the beginning of a card's data field, that card might be placed ahead of 
other cards relative to THAT field; The ASCII value of "1st" is less than 
"First" and "FIRST" is less than "First" etc. Keep this in mind when creating 
CRDFIL files. 
    When finished sorting, CRDSRT will display the file directory of the file's
source, Disk or RAM, and you will be asked to name the "new" file. Press ENTER 
to use the previous name and your file will replace the previous file or enter 
a new name. The file will then be saved to the same source as the original.
    When CRDSRT finishes writing the new file it returns to the main menu. You 
can then process your file with any of the other CRDFIL programs as usual.



		- ERRORS -

     The error trapping routines are only designed to catch problems in the 
card file string lengths. If you enter a wrong file name, are short on RAM or 
some other error the program will END and display the error code.
     If you error out because of lack of RAM then go to the computer main menu,
kill SRT***.DO and SRT###.DO, if found, and clear some more space. Re-run 
CRDSRT.
     Let me know if there is interest in a version of CRDSRT that would sort 
card lengths over 253 characters. Tony has suggested a "key" sort system and I 
will write one if there is interest. I don't have very big "cards" though so 
CRDSRT works fine for me.
