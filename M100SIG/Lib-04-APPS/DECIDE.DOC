     DECIDE.BA is designed to take the complexity out of complex decision
     making.  When you must make decisions regarding multiple choices, and
     there are multiple factors affecting the choice, the decision making
     process becomes very cumbersome.  Most of the time complex decisions
     are made by gut instinct because the complexity of the variables
     become too much for the human mind.

     DECIDE.BA will ask you a series of simple questions and offer you the
     best possible choice, based upon the input that you provide.  At first
     this program might appear like a parlor game, and you may use it to
     decide what to have for dinner or which movie to view.

     Have no doubt... once you understand how it works, you will be able to
     use it to decide what automobile to purchase or how to best invest
     your hard earned money.  In generic terms, it is a "SITUATION
     EVALUATOR".

     When you first run DECIDE.BA the opening screen will appear like
     this:

     To use the program for the first time you press F1 to enter a new
     subject.  In the future you will be able to Load files that were
     previously Saved.

     When you enter a new subject you will also enter the factors, weights,
     and associative ratings.  Once this data is entered you can use F2,
     F3, and F4 to modify or correct previously entered information.

     When all required info is provided the program will make the needed
     calculations and display the results.  You will have the opportunity to
     Save this evaluation as a file and to print it.

     In order for the program to make correct evaluations, it needs the
     following input...

        A) the nature of the problem.
        B) the number of possible solutions.
        C) the possible solutions.
        D) the number of deciding factors.
        E) the deciding factors.
        F) the weight of each factor.
        G) the significance of each factor as applied to each possible
           solution.


     Once this info is provided, the program will calculate the best
     possible solution by applying the "weight" of each factor to that
     factor as it applies to that possible solution.  Perhaps a sample run
     will be more enlightening.

     Suppose your task is to decide upon an MS-DOS laptop computer.  You
     are given two possible choices, a Tandy 1400LT, and a Toshiba 1200FB.
     You must make a decision based upon price, LCD, keyboard, and
     portability.  Just follow the following steps.

     1) Run DECIDE.BA and press F1(Subj).  At the "Subject" prompt enter
        "What laptop should I get".

     2) Tell the program that you have TWO choices... a) Tandy 1400LT, and
        b) Tosh 1200FB.

     3) Tell the program that you are considering FOUR factors... a) Price,
        b) LCD, c) Keyboard, and d) Portability.

     4) Give each factor an equal weight of FIVE (5).

     5) Use the following table to assign relative ratings for each
        factor.

                 Tandy 1400LT    Tosh 1200FB
                 ------------    -----------
        Price           9          5
        LCD             7          9
        Keyboard        9          7
        Portability     3          7

     NOTE: the above ratings were derived from the September 1989 issue of
     Consumer Reports, page 568.

     When the above info is entered, DECIDE will calculate the overall best
     choice.  In this particular case the two choices will be equal, but
     that is because an equal weight was placed upon the various factors.

     If you press F3(Wght) you will be able to assign higher (or lower)
     weights to the factors that are important in making your decision.
     For example, if your need is for writing and you are a touch typist,
     then "keyboard" should be given a higher weight.  If you will be using
     the laptop to assist in sales presentations, then you may consider a
     higher weight to "LCD".  If you spend more time carrying the computer
     than actually using it, then "portability" would get the highest
     weight.  Maybe you are on a tight budget.  If so, then "price" gets
     top billing.

     If your decision is affected by several of the above factors, then you
     assign the weights accordingly.

     DECIDE.BA not only allows for the changing of "weights", but at any
     time you can also change the relative "ratings" between choice and
     factor (use F4).  And if you realize that you have omitted a factor,
     you can re-enter the number of factors and re-enter the factors too
     (F2).

     You can save (F6) whatever data you entered, and then reload (F5) that
     data at any time.  F7(Prnt) will print the results on your printer.

     DECIDE.BA will allow up to 10 choices and 10 FACTORS.  You should
     select keywords to represent your choices and factors so they will
     display nicely on the 40 column screen (about 12 to 15 characters).
     After evaluating the choices, they are sorted and displayed with the
     best choice first.

     If you are using a Tandy 200 then all choices/factors will be
     displayed, but if you are using a Model 100/102 then only the TWO best
     choices will display (the entire set of choices and factors will be
     printed if you use F7).

     COMMENTS: The provided example uses objective ratings between choice
     and factor (as derived from Consumer Reports), and subjective values
     for weights.

     You may find yourself facing a decision where the factor weights are
     pre-determined, and it will be the relationship between factor and
     choice that are based upon personal feelings.  Suppose you are about
     to hire a new employee and you have several applicants.  You have
     given them each a written test, an in depth interview, and you will
     also judge appearance and bilingual skills.

     In this case you may know that the written exam gets a weight of 3,
     the interview weighs 4, appearance 2, and bilingual skills rates 1.
     Now these weights are not altered but the choice-to-factor score are
     subjective.

     The main purpose of this program is to put you in touch with yourself.
     If the highest score is not your first choice then you may want to
     reconsider the value you place upon the FACTORS or RATINGS.

     If you use this program often, and are completely honest with your
     evaluation of factors/ratings, and the program agrees with your
     "feelings" then you will discover what "motivates" you.  If DECIDE.BA
     does not confirm your choice, you can alter the variables until your
     choice is confirmed, and get a clear picture of your priorities and
     motivating factors.

     Whether you use DECIDE.BA to assist in making your decisions, or adjust
     variables to discover your priorities, you will certainly benefit
     by using it.  Use it often.
