  CURFIT is a non-linear regression analysis program.  Six curve types
  are sequentially fit to the input data: Y=a+bX, Y=ae^(bX), Y=aX^b,
  Y=a+b/X, Y=1/(a+ bX) and Y=X/(a+bX).  The program also determines the
  correlation coefficient, F -ratio and variances of the analysis and displays
  the data and calculated values.  Your data is entered as data statements.

  The program requires ULTRASCREEN which increases the screen size to
  60x10. The data files written by LOGIT can be read and used by the CRDFIL
