CONT.100 IS A PROGRAM THAT TOGGLES THE
CASSETTE MOTOR ON & OFF AT PRESET
TIMES.  THE DISPLAY SHOWS THE CURRENT
STATUS, AND AN ARROW POINTS TO THE NEXT
TOGGLE TIME.
  I HAVE DESIGNED A SIMPLE CIRCUIT THAT
USES A LOW COST RELAY TO TURN MY AUDIO
TAPE RECORDER ON AND OFF TO RECORD
PROGRAMS THAT I MISS.  YOU CAN USE IT
TO TURN LIGHTS ON AND OFF FOR SECURITY,
OR FOR ANYTHING WITHIN THE RATINGS OF
THE RELAY.
  ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS TO PROGRAM A
TONE OR A TUNE BETWEEN LINES 440 AND
450, AND IT WILL SOUND AT THE SELECTED
TIMES.
  TO USE THE PROGRAM, ENTER THE TIME
FOR EACH TOGGLE.  THE FIRST TIME WILL
TURN THE CASSETTE MOTOR "ON", THE
SECOND "OFF", THE THIRD "ON", ETC., UP
TO SEVEN TOGGLES.  (THE PROGRAM CAN BE
ADAPTED TO 14 BY USING TWO COLUMNS.)
PRESS "ESC" WHEN YOU HAVE ENTERED THE
TIMES YOU NEED.  PRESS "ESC" AT ANY
TIME TO EXIT WHATEVER MODE YOU'RE IN.
  PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW YOU LIKE IT,
AND OF COURSE IF THERE ARE ANY BUGS.
IF THERE IS ENOUGH INTEREST (AND IF I
HAVE ENOUGH TIME!) I WILL PUBLISH THE
SCHEMATICS FOR THE RELAY DRIVER,
INCLUDING WIRELESS RADIO CONTROL FOR
UNDER $35.
