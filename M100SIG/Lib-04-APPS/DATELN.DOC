        DATELINE / A SHAREWARE PROGRAM FOR THE 100/102 and BOOSTER PAK

       Before converting DATELINE to a program from a text file, note that
 there is a loader program in the file before the actual body of the program.
 Cut and paste the first program into a TEXT file called DATELINE, convert it
 to a basic file and save it as DATELN.BA. (You must use this name.) This
 small program is put any where you want to run DATELINE from. The actual 
 program resides in it's own DIRECTORY called EVENT. Take the remaining file
 and save it as a basic file called DATELI.BA and store it in EVENT DIR. When
 you run DATELINE it will check memory for the space needed to run the main
 program. If you answer yes to the prompt then the main program will be loaded
 into the WORSPACE and run. Upon exiting you will be returned to the loader
 program in the place that you entered it from. (You can have the loader in
 any number of places and you will always be returned to the DIR you entered
 the loader from.  As an option you can modify the loader program, taking the
 "Menu" (2 of them) and replacing them with CALL63013,1 and the loader will
 return you to the UR-2 menu so that it can be run from BASIC in the UR-2.


                            =USING DATELINE=

DATELINE is a program that uses a linear calendar format. The linear format
 gives a more natural display of the month.

            0000000001111111111222222222233

            MTWTFSSMTWTFSSMTWTFSSMTWTFSSMTW

There are 6 options from the main screen. One and two are the left and right
 arrow keys. The left steps the calandar back one month, and the right arrow
 key steps the display ahead one month. There are four function keys available
 in Version 1. The first key is NEW. The second key is Flag. The third key is
 Data. The fourth key is Menu.

      The NEW function key brings up a display on the lower right of the 
screen, "mm/yyyy". The display disappears and is replaced with, "mm". You may
 enter the month, using a single number (2) or a single digit with a zero (02)
, or two digits (12). Then "yyyy" is displayed. If you hit ENTER then you will
 accept the default of the curent year. You may also enter an alternate year
 and then the screen will display your choice, asking for approval
 (eg.,02/1988). If pressed again ENTER will acept the data as entered, while
 the ESC key will bring you to the first NEW prompt.

      The Flag function key changes the day of the week that is flaged. Monday
 is the default day that is flaged. Press the Flag function key and the lower
 right display will show "MTWTFSS" with a blinking cursor. Using the left and
 right cursor keys will move the blinking cursor back and forth while ENTER
 will accept the day under the cursor. The new setting will stay active until
 a new choice is made. 

      The Data function key has a list of options. 
      Data searches a TEXT file for data strings with a date format. The first
 part of the string must contain the following format... 00/00 :MON. 

The days must be formated.. MON. TUES. WED. THURS. FRI. SAT. SUN. 
The only other restrictions on format are that the whole string
 does not exceed 255 characters (including spaces). (If the date and day is 
entered and no data then you should follow the date with a "0"[00/00 :MON.0].)
 It is a good idea to use a sort program to occasionally sort such a TEXT file
to assure proper date order.


       Data will display all text files in the Workspace. You may also search
 TEXT files in the RAMDISK. (You must use the "R:" prefix.) As a matter of
 fact, if RAMDISK files are searched then the process will proceed faster than
 with files in the Workspace. The default SEARCH file is EVENTS. Type over if
you don't want EVENTS. Alternately push ESC and the files will redraw and the
default will not appear at the prompt. Note, that you may go into edit and 
search for any appearence of EVENTS and either change to a new default or to
"" (the null string).
Data will then ask you for a string to match.
 When you enter your string (the serach does considers case) next press ENTER.
 The string will redraw with the character for ENTER appended to the string.
 At this point ENTER will accept the string and ESC will clear your choice and
 allow you to enter a new choice. You now have the option of entering a second
 string. You may forego a second string by ENTER, ENTER.  You are next asked
 whether or not you want to display the strings you are searching for. Next
 you are asked if you if you want to save the matches to a TEXT file. Again
 you may be able to store to the Workspace or to the RAMDISK.
 The default file is STORE. Type over if you don't want to use STORE. Alter-
nately push ESC and the files will redraw and the default will not appear at 
the prompt. Note, that you may go into edit and search for any appearence of
STORE and either change to a new default or to "" (the null string). If you
 had already choosen to display the strings, then you have the option of
 selecting only the strings that you select to save to a file, otherwise all
 strings will be saved. There will be a delay as DATELINE searches to the
 appropriate month in the TEXT file to make the matches. 

      If you choose not to display then a line will be plotted for each string
 that matches for that day, over the date. As many as 14 matches will plot
 over a particular date. 
      If you choose to display the strings then when a string is matched it
 will be displayed until you press the space bar. Then the next string will be
 displayed, until they have all been displayed. Pressing ESC will abort the
 search. When the search is over "END" will be displayed at the top of the
 display. If you press ENTER you will be returned to the opening display. If
 you press ESC then the file selection display will be redrawn and you may do
 the search again. This time your previous choices for files and strings will
 be displayed and ENTER, ENTER will accept them as the default while ESC or
 typing over will accept your new choices.
      If you had chosen to CONFIRM your choices to save to the TEXT file then
 ENTER accepts the save and space will move on to the next displayed string.
 If you don't want to accept the string pressing space twice will pass on to
 the next string to be displayed. ESC key will abort.

       At the present DATELINE has no means of entering data into TEXT files.
 If enough people support DATELINE I will write a program to create data
 files, as well as updating current files. It will automatically enter
 reoccuring strings and have other functions.
