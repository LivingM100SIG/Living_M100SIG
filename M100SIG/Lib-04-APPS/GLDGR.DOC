GLDGR.BAS is the general ledger printing program for GL100.

To run, both CJ.DO (cash journal) and WTB.DO (Chart of accts/Working trial 
balance) must be present in RAM.

A general ledger is a listing of all transactions, by account, with subtotals. 
An essential component of the audit trail, which is accountingese for figuring 
just what you did to run up the bills so high.

Don't panic if your printer runs in funny fits and starts. Even Dbase3+ will do
that on this type of program if a separate sort file isn't used. In the 
interest of RAM conservation, I didn't use one.
