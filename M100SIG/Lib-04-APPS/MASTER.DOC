
This is an explanation of what I call "MASTER.BA".

"MASTER.BA" is a combined program for use with the Interactive Solutions 
microchip software and a dot matrix printer.  (in particular, the DMP105 from 
Tandy/Radio Shack).

The program combines, via subprograms, a choice of various functions:

        1 = To send set up instructions to the DMP105 as follows:
                1 = Near Letter Quality 10 pitch type
                2 = Small print, regular
                3 = Near Letter Quality small print
                4 = Double width type
                5 = Draft quality
        2 = Activate INTSOL chip
        3 = Copy Data Manager files
        4 = Clear space*
        5 = MORE CHOICES
	6. VERIFY tape save"
	7. SORT a file"
	8. GLOBAL SEARCH/REPLACE"
	9. TFND a file"
	0. FIGURE LOAN PAYMENT"
	1. RETURN TO FIRST MENU

*=when Interactive Solutions is in use, a few hundred bytes of memory 
disappears from use.  This restores that memory for _temporary_ use.

Options dump you back into Basic where F4 will re-enter you into "MASTER.BA"'s 
master Menu to make another choice (like to enter INTSOL after setting up the 
printer).

Option 2 puts you into the Interactive Solutions program, when complete returns
you to main Menu.

Option 5 moves you to a second menu with a choice of useful programs!

NOTE: Line 0 contains a command to "FIX" the year setting in DATE$, this will 
need to be adjusted each New Year's Day to the appropriate year. (See messages 
etc. about _that_ lovely "UNDOCUMENTED FEATURE"!!!)

6.  Lets you compare a CAS file with its RAM counterpart (must be first program
on tape AND have same name as a RAM file that is CURRENTLY in RAM.

7.  Lets you designate a file to be sorted in ascending order.  Obtained from 
the DL, integrated into this menu.

8.  Does a Search and Replace, selective or global, on up to ten specified 
items.  Will also delete an item.

9.  Allows you to TFND a file (integrating TFND.BA from DL).  This allows one 
to search a file (like FIND or LFND in NOTE) but places results in NEWFIL.DO 
instead of on screen or printer!.  You can change name of destination file by 
substituting on line #128 the name of an alternate .DO file, such as NOTE.DO.

0.  Will figure a monthly car or other loan payment by prompting you for amount
(total principal), length of loan in years, and interest.

HOPE THIS IS USEFUL TO SOMEONE!!!!!!

LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND SPECIFIC BYTEFYTING TECHNIQUES.  MUST BE ON THE PHD 
LEVEL (Push Here, Dummy - Change z on line 47 to x, etc.) AS MY PROGRAMMING 
SKILLS ARE AMATEURISH AT BEST!
