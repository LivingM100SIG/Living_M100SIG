BIBPWR: A Disk based file management system for the M100 and TDD using POWR-DOS

===============================================================================

-
-
     BIBPWR is an automatic, easy to use file reference system which will:
      > store, update and cross-reference the names of your Disk AND Tape files
with their location, sizes and comments
      > keep track of update dates
      > find individual file/subject references anywhere in your library file
      > print disk and cassette labels PLUS two different styles of 
directories; one alphabetically cross referenced, and one alphabetically source
by source
-
     The number of files you can catalog is limited only by available RAM.
-
     PLEASE read all these instructions completely before running BIBPWR. 
They're NOT complicated but they ARE necessary.
-
     BIBPWR.BA is written for use with POWR-DOS by Acroatix (now available FREE
in DL9) but it MAY work with other DOS accessible with "0:" commands. It uses 
LFILESV, LFILES, LFILESTO and LFILESMENU  commands. If your DOS does NOT 
support these commands, continue to use BIBLIO.BA which contains its own disk 
access routines and DON'T RUN BIBPWR till we've discussed it. 
     If you have previously used BIBLIO.BA to catalog your disk and cassette 
files you will find that BIBPWR.BA, being Disk based, cuts in HALF the RAM 
required for operation. This is because all of the sorting routines run without
needing a temporary .DO file to store "sort" info in addition to the primary 
RAM copy of BIBFYL.DO. The BIBFYL.DO data files created with BIBLIO.BA and 
BIBPWR.BA are IDENTICAL and therefore are FULLY COMPATIBLE with either version 
and BIBPRT.BA

                                INITIAL SET-UP
-
     Download BIBPWR.BA, BIBLDR.BA, BIBPRT.BA and BIBPWR.DOC (this file). Edit 
out the garbage and checksum them as .DO files. Print out a copy of BIBPWR.DOC 
for future use. Save all the program files as .BA files. RUN BIBLDR.BA and it 
will create three files:
    - BIBSRT.CO is a modified version of the Perry/Wheeler SORTHI.CO which runs
in the Alt/LCD buffer but will be run from the DISK where BIBPWR and BIBFYL are
stored.
    - BIBFYL.DO will be the data file. (Line 1 MUST start with # and line 2 
with *.)
    - END<!>.DO will be used in the cassette update routine. (If you won't be 
cataloging cassette files you can kill END<!> and move to the next paragraph.) 
The dummy file named END<!>.DO MUST be saved as the LAST file on each cassette;
either at the end of each side if you'll index each side separately or at the 
end of side 2 if you prefer to treat the whole tape as one source. (also a 
handy way to find the end of current programs on a side).
-
     BIBPRT.BA will create "fancy" directories and LABELS for your tapes and 
disks. Although BIBPWR.BA has a built-in X-Ref print function for creating an 
all-inclusive and very useful printed cross reference, BIBPRT is comprehensive 
and prints a variety of formated file documents in 80/96/132 column format. 
Follow the instructions in the first few lines of BIBPRT.

                                   OPERATION

     Although BIBPWR CAN be run from DISK, you'll find it much less confusing 
to load a .BA copy into RAM. It uses the same amount of RAM either way but is 
much more easily selected from the main menu during various routines. Also, be 
sure that POWR-DOS is installed! 
     BIBPWR first displays it's main menu and you make your selection by 
pressing the corresponding letter. (The menus all require UPPER CASE letters 
for reasons discussed below.)
     Before you use BIBPWR for the first time you should decide on a method of 
identifying your disks and tapes. You can use any combination of letters and 
numbers with a maximum of THREE. Try to enter your sources in the order you 
want them in the directory. Disks and tapes will be combined in BIBFYL.DO but 
will print out separately for the Directories. Although you can change the 
order of source I.D.'s later, it requires some VERY careful editing so doing it
right initially is worth the time. (Once the source is entered, subsequent 
updates will retain the original sequence.)
     BIBPWR starts the update process by sorting all commented files with the 
same source I.D. into a small array. If BIBFYL.DO already containes an 
annotated file record with the same name and source ID as each "new" version, 
it will save your previous "old" comments and append them to the "new" file 
record. Conversly, if you previously had an annotated file record that does NOT
appear on the "new" source then that file and comment will be lost.
     This means you only have to annotate a file record ONCE in BIBFYL.DO and, 
as long as you keep that file name and source ID together, your comments will 
be appended to subsequent updates of that file and source. (see "annotate" 
below)
     If you receive the message "Need RAM..." clear some or start a new BIBFYL;
then re-run BIBPWR. If you fill up one BIBFYL just save it to your medium as 
BIB-1 etc. and continue. (Remember: ALWAYS title the current data file as 
BIBFYL and put # as the first character in line 1 and * as the first character 
in line 2.) 	 
     During the update process you will be asked to alternate between your 
BIBFYL.DO "storage" disk and the disk or cassette to be updated. After each 
update you will be prompted for "Update another..? Y/N". Pressing Y will prompt
for the next source: N will run BIBSRT.CO from your "BIBFYL.DO" disk. and rerun
BIBPWR.
-
-
   <D>isk update: 
     At BIBPWR's main menu press D and enter the 3 character disk I.D. You will
then be prompted when to insert your disk. Press <ENTER> to continue. Any other
key will abort the update and re-run BIBPWR. When BIBPWR is finished updating 
your disk you will be prompted for "...another?" Press Y and continue or N 
which will run BIBSRT.CO from your "BIBFYL.DO storage disk". BIBPWR will re-
start.
-
-
   <C>assette update:
     Press <C> and enter the 3 character tape I.D. at the prompt; insert your 
tape in the tape deck and press PLAY, then <ENTER>. The cassette process is 
automatic but requires you to turn over the tape if you chose to put END<!> on 
one side only. The tape process tries to LOAD each tape file, stops, reads the 
screen, ID's the file and saves the name with correct extension. It then pauses
to ask you for the tape counter reading which it will use in BIBFYL.DO in place
of disk file sizes. Enter no more than 5 digits. (These will be shown with a 
"#" added as the right character in directories and labels.) BIBPWR will repeat
until it finds END<!>.
     If you forgot END<!> just press SHIFT/BREAK or CTRL-C at a "counter" 
prompt when the tape is finished and then type: LOAD"BIBPWR" press <ENTER>, and
type RUN78 and press <ENTER>. This will re-run BIBPWR at the right line as if 
you had remembered to put END<!> in place. (This may also leave the file 
CSTEMP.DO in RAM which can be killed manually after you're finished.)
      Tape files will have a "c" as the last ext. character in X-ref and 
directories.
     When BIBPWR is finished updating your tape you will be prompted for 
"...another?" Press Y and continue or N which will run BIBSRT.CO from your 
"BIBFYL.DO storage disk". BIBPWR will re-start itself.
-
-
   <A>nnotate:
     This will download BIBFYL to RAM and take you to BIBFYL via TEXT. Here you
will see the BIBFYL record of all your cataloged files. The format is: FILE.EXT
ID SIZE; use F1 to search if desired. (Remember you are in TEXT and that Ctrl -
> will take you to the end of a line as well as all the other regular TEXT 
commends.)
     You can use 20 characters for your comments if you don't leave a space 
after the file size. BIBPWR's "comment recovery" array is sized to let you use 
ONLY 40 CHARACTERS PER FILE! You can change the CLEAR1600 (40x40) statement in 
line 2 if you need more comment room but be VERY careful when adding over 20 
characters. ONLY ONE Cr PER FILE RECORD! I suggest you use only UPPER CASE 
letters for comments because of the simple search routine used later. When 
you're finished "annotating" return to menu via F8 and run BIBPWR from the main
menu. When it runs you will be prompted for approval to overwrite the DISK 
record of BIBFYL with your newly edited RAM version. CHECK THE FILE SIZES FOR 
OBVIOUS DISCREPANCIES. If there seems to be a problem, correct it before 
overwriting your DISK record!
-
-
   <S>earch:
     Choose a string to search for in BIBFYL. The routine looks for an EXACT 
match of your search string ANYWHERE in BIBFYL.DO: If you chose "PRINT" as the 
search string then ALL file records containg that string would be ouput: 
whether the match was in a file name or comment. You can search for source #'s,
file types, names etc.. This is very handy and why I've tried to keep everthing
UPPER CASE including comments! ("SAM" is not "sam".) <D>isplay will show 6 
files, pausing when the screen is full; <P>rint will ask you if your paper is 
ready then Lprint all matches. "Searching for >  <" will display the "search" 
string at the top of the screen while BIBPWR works.
-
-
   <X>-ref:
     This will Lprint a semi-formatted standard pitch 80 column alphabetical 
cross reference. All annotated file records will display a "<" next to the file
description.
-
-
   <R>ecords:
     From this prompt you will find which ID's are currently filed and when 
each source was last updated: "d" means a disk source and "c" means tape.
-
-
   <F>iles:
     This will send the command LFILES to your TDD and page through the files 
on the loaded disk. DON'T SHIFT/BREAK out of the display or you'll have to re-
run BIBPWR: not a major problem but, if you do, watch for any RAM/DISK BIBFYL 
size discrepancy as discussed above. It is better just to "spcbr" to end of 
files and let BIBPWR re-start itself.
-
-
   <P>urge:
     This routine lets you remove ALL file records of a chosen source, 
INCLUDING annotated files. Use carefully!!  Press P at the Menu; enter 3 
character source I.D. at the prompt or <ENTER> to return to previous menu.
-
-
   <E>xit:
     ALWAYS END A BIBPWR SESSION BY RETURNING TO THE M100 MENU USING <E>XIT. 
BIBPWR will have saved BYBFYL.DO to your DISK where you should also keep 
BIBSRT.CO, BIBPWR.BA, and BIBPRT.BA for your next session. (Keep BIBLDR.BA 
someplace too, in case you lose BIBSRT.CO.) 
     BIBPWR exits with an LFILESMENU command. This should restore all your 
TELCOM stats to their original values.
-
-
-
   Points to remember:
     The size of BIBFYL (file records + comments) is really only limited by 
available RAM. 5000 bytes will store about 200 uncommented file records. BIBPWR
needs it's own 4500 bytes plus 2324 bytes for array storage and string space 
plus free RAM at least as large as BIBFYL.DO to run.
     The info stored in BIBFYL.DO is not explosive but it IS rigidly formatted 
for BIBPWR. Please be very careful when you directly add or delete BIBFYL info.
You can change the sequence of sources in the first line if you PERFECTLY 
follow the syntax used. (Any mistakes here will totally foul up BIBPWR's sort 
and update routines.) You MUST also locate the appropriate date sets and change
THEIR sequence in the second line; 1st source goes with first date etc.)
     Only the most rudimentary error trapping was used to save space. Be sure 
that the disk drive and cassette recorder are on, loaded, and ready to go. (Be 
sure you've CSAVEd END<!> as the last prog on your tape: otherwise BIBPWR will 
try to run the tape update forever!) 
     BIBPWR makes and then kills PWRTMP.DO & CASTMP.DO for interim sorting 
storage. Although BIBFYL.DO is the file BIBPWR uses when running, you can of 
course keep library files in your storage medium under any name. Just be sure 
that you name the catalog file to be processed as BIBFYL.DO on your disk when 
you run BIBPWR. As BIBFYL.DO fills up, the final sort routine does take time to
sort. Be patient; it's working as fast as it can. (60sec/7K BIBFYL).
     You can leave any "input" prompt in BIBPWR by pressing <ENTER>. If you 
should "Need RAM" during any routine DON'T PANIC! Go to the main menu and look 
for BIBFYL.DO and PWRTMP.DO. If you find both then clear more RAM and inspect 
PWRTMP. If it contains commented file entries then use TEXT to APPEND PWRTMP.DO
to BIBFYL.DO and re-run BIBPWR. If you find only PWRTMP then load BIBFYL.DO 
into RAM from your disk and compare file entries. If BIBFYL.DO contains the 
SAME entries as PWRTMP.DO then it's safe to kill PWRTMP.DO. If, however, there 
are NO entries in BIBFYL.DO for the files in PWRTMP.DO then APPEND PWRTMP.DO as
above and re-run BIBPWR.
     BIBPWR keeps the last two digits of the DATE$ at "88" in line 152. As the 
years roll by simply change "88".
     BIBPWR can't correctly record more than 6 .CO files in a row on a tape. 
Please put a different kind of file at least every 6 .CO files on your tapes.
     Although every effort has been made to make BIBPWR fool-proof, mistakes DO
happen. It is only prudent to keep a back-up copy of BIBFYL.DO someplace; 
particularly as you fill it up with comments. It is fairly simple to log all 
your sources again but MUCH more time consuming to re-annotate 400 files!
