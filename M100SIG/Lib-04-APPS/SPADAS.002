The AGENCY.DO file must be present in
the above format to correctly function
within the program.  Each item in the
above left column must occupy its own
line in the order listed.

If AGENCY.DO is not present or in its
proper format, the program will not
cease to execute.  It will cause the
field to be alphanumeric and fill it
with empty spaces or whatever is in its
position in the file.  If the user
notices an entry is incorrect or empty,
the field can be corrected from within
the screen.  The AGENCY.DO file should
then be checked for problems and edited
when appropriate.
