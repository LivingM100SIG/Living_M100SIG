

The program "AUTO.BAS" is designed to work with a CRDFIL template, and should
be stored in your computer as AUTO.BA. Create a CRDFIL template under the name
MILES.DO.  AUTO.BA assumes that you will use the following field names in the
template:

DATE: 
MILES: 
GALS: 
COST: 
DESC: 
T. GALS: 
T. COST: 
MPG: 
COST/MILE: 

The last four fields are not filled in when you enter data; these are the
fields that AUTO.BA will calculate.

You need not know anything about programing to use the program. It looks for a
file called "MILES.DO" and creates a file called "TEMP.DO while working.  When
it has updated the file, it will kill the old file, and rename TEMP.DO as
MILES.DO.  Users of the Tandy 200 will have to add a CLOSE: statement at the
beginning of line 180, before the KILL statement, since the 200 cannot kill or
rename any file that is still open.

You will also need to change line  155. My car had 5200 miles when I purchased
it. Substitute your beginning milage for that value.  Use 0 for a new car.

This was a quick-and-dirty program for my own needs, so I haven't done any
error checking. If there is no file called "MILES.DO," you will simply get an
error message and be kicked back into BASIC.

I hope this is as useful and easy for you as it is for me.
