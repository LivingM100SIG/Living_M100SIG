    DF-RPT provides three useful data management options for DATFIL and
CRDFIL data files.  It is written for users who prefer to select reporting
paramaters each time they prepare a report.  Users who regularly prepare
reports with the SAME format may prefer the automation of DF-AUT.BA, also in
this library.

    DF-RPT:
        1) permits you to completely sort an entire data file by any
           priority of prompt fields.
        2) will prepare a formatted report based on any data fields you
           require and send it to either printer, disk or RAM.
        3) permits you to set conditions for each data field which must be
           met before the record is reported and it will add data columns and
           report the total.

    DF-RPT is easy to use and fully compatible with the 100/102/200.  Because
it uses Wilson Van Alst's ZIPSRT.CO sorting program, DF-RPT can process
data-records of virtually any combined field length.  Please read ALL these
instructions before using DF-RPT.
    With your source file, DF-RPT, and ZIPSRT on the menu you must have 3500
bytes PLUS the size of your source file of additional free RAM.  When using
disk-based source files and with DF-RPT and ZIPSRT in RAM you'll only need
3500 bytes plus the size of your source file as additional free RAM: clearly
an advantage when using large source/data files!
    If writing a report to RAM you must also have enough additional space for
the report.  Large reports can be written to disk and printed later.


                - SET-UP -

     Download DF-RPT.DOC (this file) & DF-RPT.BA.  M100/102 users also
download ZIPSRT.100 (DL7). T200 users will need ZIPSRT.200 from DL10.  Remove
any extra bytes and checksum the files as .DO files.  Make and save a copy of
DF-RPT.BA for backup.
     RUN ZIPSRT.100/200 as appropriate. They will create ZIPSRT.CO which must
be on the menu whenever you run DF-RPT.BA. Save a copy of ZIPSRT as backup.
     If you'll be working with Disk based data files you must have your disk
loaded, the drive on and a DOS installed that is "ON" and which recognizes
"0:" commands.



                - OPERATION -

     DF-RPT accepts either UPPER or lower-case letters at all prompts and
<ENTER> is assumed to mean "no".  Don't use extensions or prefixes when asked
for file names.  "LCD:" and "LPT:" are NOT acceptable file names.
     When you run DF-RPT.BA you will first be prompted for the location of
your data file.  If you press "R", RAM files will display.  Pressing "D"
will display your disk files and automatically prefix the chosen file name
with a "0:". (NOTE: some DOS will display files "linearly": i.e. one above
the other. Use the spacebar to complete the listing after making a note of
your file name.  DF-RPT will then continue normally.)
     Enter the name of the file in either instance with or without extension.
You will then be asked if you want to sort the source file before reporting.
(Some of your data files may not be arranged for sorting or you may wish to
report the records in the order they were added.) If you answer "n", skip to
"output screen" below.

   SORT SCREEN:
     This screen will display all your prompt fields with a "Y" and "N"
in the upper and lower right screen corners along with "sort" written
vertically along the right side of the screen as a reminder you're inputing
"sort" data.
     The cursor will be next to the first prompt field.  The Right and Down
arrow keys and <ENTER> move the cursor to the next open field and the Left
and Up arrows move the cursor to the preceeding open field.  UPPER or lower
case letters work at single letter prompts.
     Move the cursor to the field you want to use as the primary sort field
and press "1".  You may continue to enter numbers further defining sort
priorities to a maximum of 9.  DF-RPT will not let you repeat or skip a
number or enter one that exceeds 9 or the number of sort fields, whichever is
less, and will only move the cursor among un-numbered fields.  (Whenever you
want to erase all the numbers and start over just press "n".)
      When you're satisfied with the priorities press "y".  Because all
fields must be accounted for, DF-RPT will automatically number all remaining
fields and display your sort priorities if you've chosen to enter less than 9
and/or there are more than 9 fields.  (If you haven't entered ANY numbers
then DF-RPT will simply sort by the appearance order of the prompts.)  The
cursor will then move to the upper right corner.  Review the display and
press "Y" if you're satisfied.  Any other key press will clear the screen and
begin again.

     DF-RPT will then show the record numbers as they are being read and
call ZIPSRT to do the sorting.  Please be patient when running large files.
Sorting is M/L fast but preparing a 5K data file may take 1-2 minutes.
     Your records will be sorted by the "ASCII line value" of each data field.
If you left spaces at the beginning of a data field, that record might be
placed ahead of other records relative to THAT field.  The ASCII value of "1st"
is "less" than "First" and "FIRST" is less than "First" etc.  (Keep this in
mind when creating DATFIL/CRDFIL files.)

   OUTPUT SCREEN:
     DF-RPT then will display a menu of choices for your data.  (If unsorted
then that message will display in place of <S>tore... described below.)  Press
the appropriate single letter.  Each routine returns to this menu.
        <S>tore sorted file
           This will re-display the files contained on your original source,
           RAM or disk, and prompt you for a name for the newly sorted data
           file: <ENTER> alone uses the same name.  Your sorted data will be
           written to that file: there will be NO change in the original.
           (Be sure that you have enough free space available in the
           destination medium for another copy of the source file!)
        <P>rinted report
           Outputs report to a parallel printer (serial printer mod is easy)
        <R>AM report
           Writes report to a RAM file named by you: use together with TEXT
           when writing documents etc.
        <M>enu
           Quits to the computer main menu

   RPT SCREEN:
     The report creation routines begin by re-displaying your prompt fields
with the reminder "rpt" written vertically at the right side of the screen. 
Regardless of how you chose to sort your data earlier you now choose which
fields to report and the order you wish them reported.  For example: you may
have chosen to sort a mailing list by ZIPCODE, Name and City but you can
report the data as Name and City only for a RAM report and Name and Phone
Number for a printed report!
     Begin as before with number "1" in the first field to be displayed,
using the arrows and <ENTER> to move the cursor to desired fields.  You may
choose only one field or as many as 9.  When you've chosen the fields for
display press "y": "n" begins again.
     DF-RPT will now display the header line for your chosen report and show
how wide the report will be, based on the longest data entry for each
selected field plus two spaces between fields.  If the format and width are
acceptable press "y": any other key will begin again.

   CONDITION SCREEN:
     You will now be asked if you want to "Set field conditions".  "N" begins
the report with no conditions set.  Press "Y" to create reporting conditions.
All your prompt fields will display along with a "><=$+" reminder. 
     Regardless of how you sorted or chose to display your report, you may now
choose a variety of parameters to further define the conditions under which a
record will be reported: all fields are available for setting conditions.  A
record will not be printed at all if ALL conditions are not met for specified
fields.
    In the example above you might have choosen to report only Name and Phone
number BUT you may set a condition that restricts your report to ONLY Names
and phone numbers with "New York" in the address.
     Four symbols are used to set selection conditions: ">", "<", "=" and
"$".  "+" is used to indicate you want these fields totaled.  (They function
similarly to their BASIC programming use.)
       ">" means greater-than.
       "<" means less-than.
       "=" means equals.
       "$" means a string of letters or numbers.
       "+" totals all values in this field and prints the result

     When using these functions it is important to understand how DF-RPT uses
them.  Because DATFIL/CRDFIL record-fields can contain BOTH numeric and
alphabetic data you MUST know the nature of the data field before choosing a
function.  DF-RPT accepts only ONE condition per field.  E.g. if you wanted
to report values = or > $300 then you would enter >299.99 in the data field.
     The four functions ">", "<", "=" and "+" relate to NUMERIC fields ONLY
because they're used arithmetically.  Using these four functions in an
alphabetic field could result in non-selection because letters always have a
"value" of 0.
     "$" should generally be used for ALPHABETIC fields because DF-RPT looks
to see if your chosen field contains an EXACT match of the text "string" you
enter.  You CAN use "$" in numeric fields: e.g. to select 5 digit ZIPCODEs
from fields that also contain 10 character ZIP+4 data.   The arrows and
<ENTER> move the cursor among the fields as before.  Press the desired symbol
and it will display and wait for further input: type your data and press
<ENTER>: "+" is the only entry necessary to total that field.  If you want to
change your entry simply re-type it.  When you're done press "y" at any prompt
and your report will be prepared: "n" begins "conditions" again.

     The record # displays as each record is read.  When DF-RPT finishes
the report it returns to the "OUTPUT SCREEN" menu.  You can prepare another
report or press "m" to quit DF-RPT and return to the main menu.


            - Serial Printers -

     If you use a serial printer you can either print a RAM report with your
serial print utility or you can change the code in LINE 36 from "LPT:" to
whatever serial stats your printer requires. (No "ready" test is done by
DF-RPT for serial printers.)


                - ERRORS -

     The error trapping routines are only designed to catch problems with a
file name.  Any other error will END and display the error code except
"No Printer!" which returns to the "OUTPUT SCREEN" menu.
     If you error out because of lack of RAM then go to the computer main
menu, kill SRT***.DO and SRT###.DO, if found, clear some more RAM and re-run
DF-RPT.

    Paul Globman did Beta testing on the M100 routines and suggested some of
the display routines.  He also wrote DATFIL.100/200 which breathed new life
into the "CRDFIL" tradition.  Wilson Van Alst wrote ZIPSRT.100/200 which
allowed DF-RPT to work with any length records.
