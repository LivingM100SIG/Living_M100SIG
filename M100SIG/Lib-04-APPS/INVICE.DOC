.
There is just no way I would have been
able to get this to run without the
help of the SIG...so here is the 
"finished" product.
.
.I prepared the program to prepare
statements for my "moonlight" mailorder
business.  I presently have four
products available at a fixed price
with the only variance being shipping
costs and the number shipped.  
Backorders are not a problem, so the
number shipped will always be the 
same as the number ordered.
.
There is an "Other" section which people
with a wide variety of products might
rather use than the "custom" products
or services the other sections make
provision for.

.After three copies of the invoice are
printed, the data is all loaded into
a data file whose name is drawn from
the name of the customer.
.
The program also makes provision for
printing a special message on the
invoice...."Charged to your Credit
Card"....etc.
.
The program is heavily commented and
tons of commands could be put on the
same line to reduce the space it 
occupies in RAM.
.
As now written it runs on a Radio Shack
DMP 120 with a "fancy" heading for
the business name.  If the CHR$(00)'s
confuse your printer then just edit
them out.
.
There is a lot to be done to make this
program better.  I will look forward
to seeing the improvements and benefiting
from them along with everyone else.
