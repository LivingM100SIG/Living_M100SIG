WHAT IS KEPLER?
     KEPLER is a program written with the science fiction writer in mind. It 
generates habitable planets and their planetary systems.

HOW DO I USE IT?
     The prompts are pretty self-explanatory. In the usual mode, KEPLER randomly
generates specific values for a star and then a habitable planet. You are given 
the opportunity to accept those values as generated, or to substitute values of 
your own.

NOTE: Many values are interrelated. A planet's year, for example, 
depends on the mass of the star and the distance of the planet. Thus, you can 
change mass and distance but _not_ the length of the year.

Following are specific prompts [in brackets] and comments regarding your 
responses.

[Hit any key to begin]         Hit any key

[Please name the planet]       Give it any name you want in ASCII  (alpha-
numeric) characters

[1- Kepler Chooses a Star
 2- You Specify a Star]
                                 Under option 1, you give the star's spectral 
class, KEPLER creates values to fit.
                                 Under option 2, you give KEPLER values (i.e. 
for a particular pre-existing or pre-created star (This is useful if [a] you 
want to create a planet for Alpha Centauri, Canopus, Betelguese, etc. or [b] if 
you have an already-created star and you want KEPLER to generate the planetary 
system.)

Suppose you pick #1:
[Choose the Star's Spectral Class B A F G K M]    Choose one from these 
alternatives. B stars are hotter and bluer, M stars are cooler and redder. The 
Sun is a G star. (Most habitable worlds will probably be around F,G or K stars. 
The extremes are included so that you can have some exceptional planets if you 
wish. There is another spectral class ("O") beyond B, but it is very unlikely 
that any O stars even h^Ba^Bv^Be^B planets.)

[1- Kepler generates a habitable planet
 2- You specify a pre-created planet]
                              Under option 1, KEPLER will randomly assign 
values.
                              Under option 2, you can give the values for a pre-
existing or pre-created planet (i.e. if you have 
a planet and you want KEPLER to design a planetary system)

Assume you choose #1:
[stellar mass xxx
 stellar luminosity xxx
 planetary irradiation xxx
 Does this look right (y or n)?]
     This is your first chance to accept or reject a value. Planetary 
irradiation means the amount of energy the planet gets from its sun. Earth is 1.
Higher values will be warmer, lower values colder. Choose y if the given value 
suits your purposes, n to specify your own value.

[Distance from star: xxx
 Does that look right (y or n)?]
     The given distance represents the correct figure for the given irradiation.
Usually you will choose y in this case. Choosing n allows you to change the 
distance...which will change the irradiation.

[Period of revolution xxx
 Shall we continue?]
     Revolution is determined by the distance and the stellar mass. You get no 
choice on this one. KEPLER is just trying to be polite.

[Do you want to pick the surface gravity? (y or n)]
     y=you specify a particular figure for surface gravity
     n= KEPLER makes random choice based on diameter and density.

[Diameter xxx Does this look right?]
     Answer y if the planet is the size you want. Answering n allows you to 
specify a particular size.

[Density xxx  Mass xxx Surface gravity xxx Does the gravity look right (y or n)?
]
     Mass and density depend on surface gravity. Answer n to choose your own 
value.

It i^Bs^B possible to get yourself in a bind here, since mass, density and 
surface gravity are all interrelated. If you try to change too many values, 
KEPLER will tell you "I think we should start over."

Usually, you will just want to accept the values given and work with them. If 
you _must_ specify your own values, stick to o^Bn^Be^B of gravity, diameter and 
density.

[Input length of day (hours)?]
     You're on your own with this one. Choose whatever you want.

[Local year is xxx local days.]
[Printing into PLANET.DO]
Your work is over. KEPLER will now print the values for your planet into a 
textfile called PLANET.DO.

Suppose you choose #2 above: [You Specify a Star:]

KEPLER will print a table of Class, Mass and Luminosity and then ask:
[Stellar Mass (Sol = 1)?]
     Enter a value. If you have values for a particular star, (which you might 
find in an astronomy book) fine. If not, ranges are given in the table.

[Stellar luminosity (Sol = 1)]
     ditto

You will then wind up at:
[1- Kepler generates a habitable planet
 2- You specify a pre-created planet]


Suppose you choose #2: [You Specify a pre-created planet]

You will be asked:
[What irradiation?]
     Enter a value (Earth = 1)
[Distance from star (million kilometers)?]
     Enter a value (Earth = 149.6)
[Diameter (Earth = 1)]
     Enter a value
[Density (g/cc)[Earth=5.5]]
     Enter a value
[Mass is xxx times Earth. Surface gravity?]
     Enter a value
[Input length of day (hours)?]
     You're on your own

In whatever case, you will eventually get to:

[Local year is xxx local days. Printing into PLANET.DO]


[Shall we do the rest of the system (y or n)?]
     n means KEPLER will start over from the beginning.
     y means KEPLER will create a planetary system of 4-12 planets, including 
your world.
     Planets will be of four types: Methane giant (like Uranus &       ^LNeptune
), Jovian (like Jupiter & Saturn), Asteroids (like...uh...the Asteroids) or 
Rocky (_not_ the Flying Squirrel). Rocky planets may also be Habitable or Venus-
type.
     Values given are: Type, distance from star, mass, period of revolution, 
diameter, density, surface gravity, rotation and irradiation. (In the case of 
Asteroids, most of these values don't apply and have been set to an arbitrary 
.0001)
     PROGRAM ASSUMPTIONS:
     1. Planetary distances follow a Titius-Bode relationship.
     2. Asteroids are always next orbit in from a supermassive Jovian.

     OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
     Jovians, Methane Giants, Venus-types and Habitables form depending upon the
irradiation at that distance. If a Rocky planet is at the right distance, it has
a chance of being either Habitable or Venus-type. Rocky planets may form at any 
distance.
     Conditions for habitability:
     Irradiation of 0.3-2.0
     Gravity less than 2 gees

You will see:
[Calculating...

 Printing planet 2 into PLANET.DO
 etc.]

After the system prints, KEPLER will say:
[That was fun. Want to do another (y or n)?]
      y = restart program
      n = stop

DISCLAIMERS:
     I am not a physicist, astronomer or programmer. This program works to the 
best of my knowledge. However, I do not guarantee that the program or the 
underlying mathematics are complete or correct. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
     KEPLER is intended to give values that are illustrative rather than 
rigorous (i.e. this is a _cold_, _massive_ planet with a _high_ surface gravity.
) I am not responsible for any errors in figures used her...if you intend to use
actual numbers from the program, please verify them or have a techie friend do 
it for you.
