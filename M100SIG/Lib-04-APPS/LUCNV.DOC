LUCID FILE CONVERSION PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION

    This program is designed to convert a Lucid spreadsheet file to a form 
which can be uploaded for use on another spreadsheet program.  Specifically, 
the Lucid file is converted to a VISICALC ASCII file.  This file can be 
uploaded to another PC, and, in turn, can be converted to LOTUS 1-2-3 format. 
This is what I use this program for.  I developed it to handle spreadsheets 
developed on the M100, but which either grew too large for my 32K, or which 
needed to be used on several PC's at work.
     The program is in BASIC, and when it is executed the Lucid file to be 
converted must be in RAM.  The output file can either be in RAM, if there's 
room, or any other colon delimited file, such as CAS:, or, as I use it, a 0: 
disk file.
     All Lucid cell entries can be handled by the program, although some either
don't have a VISICALC equivalent, or may operate differently.  Listed below are
some known cautions:
1.The Lucid REF function is converted to a text string.  There is no equivalent
in either VISICALC or Lotus.
2. TBL is converted to a combination of VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP which acts 
similarly.  
    2a. Note that Lucid and Lotus work differently for values between exact 
figures in the lookup tables. Lucid goes to the next higher entry, while Lotus 
goes to the lower bound entry.  
    2b. Lotus needs the upper left corner filled.  
    2c. A very important note is that you have to add, either on the Lucid 
lookup table or in Lotus, a row after the last row of lookup values counting 
the columns 1,2,3,... This is needed to make the one dimensional Lotus lookup 
functions work like Lucid's two dimensional TBL function.  
3. Lotus may not work the same for text entries referenced by equations.  
4. Cell formulas are converted with lots of parentheses because VISICALC uses 
left to right priority, not algebraic like Lucid and Lotus.  
5.Finally, most formats from Lucid are ignored, so you'll have to fix them when
the conversion is complete.
     When you run the program, you'll be prompted for an output file type, ie 
RAM:, CAS:, 0:, LCD:, LPT:. Then you'll be prompted for the Lucid file name.  
If the program finds the .CA file, then, conversion will proceed.  Converted 
cell entries are echoed to the screen.  The converted file will be named 
XXXXXX.DO, where XXXXXX is the Lucid file name.  The converted statements will 
be echoed to the screen.  
     The file name finder is acknowledged as borrowed from another program, but
I don't recall which one. 
     Listed below is a formula listing for a sample spreadsheet and the 
resulting converted file.  Good luck.

NOTE: After you've converted this to a Lotus worksheet file, you have to add 
the following to make the table function operate properly:

     cell     entry
     ----     -----
     B12      1
     C12      2
     D12      3

Thanks to Phil Wheeler for all his help in getting this program uploaded and 
checked out.
