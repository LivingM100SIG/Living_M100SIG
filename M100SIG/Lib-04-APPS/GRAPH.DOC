   YOU MAY CHANGE FOLLOWING LINES FOR 
YOUR NEEDS:
   LINE 100 AND 110 SET THE LOWER AND 
UPPER LIMIT OF X AND Y AXES (LX, UX, LY,
AND UY MUST BE INTEGERS).
   LINE 200 CONTAINS AN EQUATION TO BE 
GRAPHED.  IT MUST BE IN THE FORM OF 
Y=....  (EX:  Y=SIN(X), Y=ABS(X), Y=2*
X^2)
   QUESTIONS ARE FOR CGP-115; ENTER 'N' 
OR NOTHING IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CGP-115 
CONNECTED; YOU CAN GRAPH ON MODEL 100 
SCREEN.  RESPONDING 'Y' TO THE QUESTION 
'AXES' DRAWS AXES ON THE PLOTTER AND 
'PLOTTER' GRAPHS THE EQUATION ON IT.  
COLOR MUST BE ENTERED BY NUMBER (0-3), 
AND LINE INDICATES LINE TYPE (0-15).  (
SEE CGP-115 MANUAL)  WHEN YOU DO NOT 
HAVE CGP-115 CONNECTED, PRESS 'ESC' TO 
EXIT.
   YOU HAVE TO RUN THE PROGRAM EACH TIME
AFTER CHANGING THE EQUATION IN LINE 200.
  IF YOU ARE USING PLOTTER, YOU CAN 
GRAPH AS MANY EQUATIONS AS YOU WANT ON 
THE SAME AXES BY RUNNING IT AGAIN AFTER 
CHANGING LINE 200.
