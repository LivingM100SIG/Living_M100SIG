DOCUMENTATION FOR MORTG.BA
--------------------------

This is a short basic program that conveniently handles mortgage loan 
calculations.  This program uses a spreadsheet-like format that allows the user
to input any 3 variables and calculate the remaining variable. The input is 
facilitated by the use of the labeled function (F) keys.  This program 
redefines the F keys for its own temporary use and upon exit of the program, 
the original BASIC functions are reinserted into F1 thru F5 with the addition 
of EDIT and KILL assigned to F6 & F7 respectively.  The F6 & F7 assignment may 
be deleted after the program has been downloaded if you don't think adding 
meaning to otherwise unused F6 & F7 does not make BASIC more convenient.  In no
case should the routine that reinserts the ORIGINAL BASIC tokens to F1 thru F5 
and F8 be deleted or else the F keys will be meaningless in future entries to 
BASIC. .  The variables are assigned dummy numbers to avoid any error 
conditions.  The user typically reassigns the variables as he inputs the 
numbers for the particular problem at hand.  As economic conditions change, the
program lines that assigns the starting dummy values may be changed.

 Items "Per1" and "Per2" on the "spreadsheet" allow the user to specify the
start & end period respectively during which the amount paid to interest is to
be calculated.  It helps during tax return time and it is handy for quickly
reminding oneself how little goes to paying off the principal during the first
five years.
