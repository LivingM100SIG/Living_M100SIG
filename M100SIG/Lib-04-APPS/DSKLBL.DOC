		DSKLBL.BA
		---------

	DSKLBL.BA is a stand-alone, no-DOS, Disk-label maker for use with the 
M100/102/200 and Tandy Disk Drive 1. It permits you to quickly print labels for
up to 15 disks per use.


		SET-UP

	Download DSKLBL.DOC (this file) and DSKLBL.BA: then edit the resulting 
.DO files to remove any extra garbage.  Checksum DSKLBL.DO, then Load and Save 
as DSKLBL.BA.
	BEFORE you run it you MUST substitute YOUR 132 char (16.8/inch) code in
line 24.  EXAMPLE: if the code for your printer is CHR$(27);"M" then line 24 
would read;   

	24 LPRINTCHR$(27);"M";'132 column code
	(Remember to include the last semi-colon.)

	If your printer is set for SKIP-OVER-PERF (SOP), a routine that 
typically permits only 60 lines of print per page by automatically setting 3 
line top and bottom margins, you MUST disable this feature while running DSKLBL
because you'll need 65 lines for a 3 by 5 label print format. You can either do
it manually or add the SOP "off" code to the end of line 2 and insert the SOP 
"on" code just before "MENU" in line 16.


		OPERATION

	Running DSKLBL.BA is a snap. Cursor select it with at least 12000 free 
RAM. When it has finished it's brief loading routine you'll be prompted for a 1
to 6 character file name. 
	Load the disk, type any combination of characters that your printer 
will print and press <ENTER>. You'll see the file names flash by next to the 
disk drive symbol and, when DSKLBL is done reading the disk, it's name will 
display below the horizontal line and you'll be prompted for the next disk.
	DSKLBL will automatically move to the "printing" prompts after you've 
entered 15 disks or YOU can do so after fewer disks by simply pressing <ENTER> 
at the name prompt. If your printer is ready you'll come to the "size" prompt. 
DSKLBL will print your labels in one of two formats each time you print a label
set.

	"<S>tandard" will print 3 labels across and 5 down on standard 8 1/2" 
by 11" plain or adhesive paper. Dotted lines are added in this format to 
facilitate cutting the paper to make the labels.

	"<L>abel" will print 1 across and 15 down and is set up for 1 15/16" by
2 3/4" labels with only a blank line between labels. This format seems to be 
the best for label "rolls" which would, of course, necessitate setting up the 
printer to mechanically handle that format. Each new label begins 12 lines 
below the last: 2" at 6 lines per inch. (Print 11 lines, skip one, begin again.
)

	After each label set is printed you'll be asked if you want to RE-PRINT
the SAME labels. I included this option so you could "test" print one set, make
sure it's the way you like it then re-print it for either a reference or 
perhaps on adhesive paper. The "size" prompt is included in this routine so you
can pick a different format each time. If you press "N" or "n" at the "repeat" 
prompt you'll return to the main menu. To do the next batch of disks just re-
run DSKLBL.

	NOTE: If you use graphics characters in your file names then DSKLBL 
will change any character with an ASCII value above 128 to a "^" (SHIFT 6). 
This prevents weird things happening to your printer in the middle of a print 
job! DSKLBL also removes the period between the file name and the extension and
converts the extension to lower case so the labels are easier to read.

	CREDITS

	This program would not have been possible without Wilson Van Alst's 
unique FYLDOS routines which are available separately as FYLDOS.100 & 
FYLDOS.200.
	Van also contributed countless hours to Beta testing and array 
management routines without which DSKLBL would still only be an idea.
