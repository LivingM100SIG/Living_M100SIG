TIK102.DO
TIK102.BA is a box office program for Tandy 100/102.  The program is written in
a non-compressed format to allow editing and customizing for whatever theatre 
you might want to adapt it to.  TIK102 prints date and reserved seat 
information on the top line of a 1 inch by 3 1/2 inch mailing label.  It prints
on every fourth label to allow easy removal from the printer.  The code is for 
a DMP200 but could be easily modified for most any printer.

To operate, the program needs Ultrasoft Innovation's ULTRASCREEN in order to 
utilize the 60 character by 10 line display.  It uses this screen format to 
show a seating chart of the entire house as set up in the data statement from 
the last line of the program.

The program prints an alignment chart for aligning labels in the printer.  It 
then prints general admission, student, and other category tickets.  Seating 
charts for various performances are saved and loaded from a seperate ASCII file
which can be edited with the TEXT program.

As seats are reserved the seat number on the display is replaced with an "r".  
Once sold the seat number is replaced with a blank space.  While the program 
does allow the operator to reserve a seat in more than one name, it will not 
allow a seat to sold more than once.  Since seat rows are input in capital 
letters the program best functions with the caps lock key on.

In addition to reserving, selling, and printing tickets, the program also does 
a basic reconciliation which totals ticket types and box office income for 
tickets sold.
