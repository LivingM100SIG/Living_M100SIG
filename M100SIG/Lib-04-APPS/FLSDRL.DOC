This documentation should be used  with FLSHCD.BA so that you may tailor it  to
your needs, whether for school or work.

Flashcard can be used to drill on  what ever  you  wish to study or memorize.
The first option on the menu allows you to create a flashcard file into a text
file which can be accesed from option 2 or option 3.

Option  2  allows you to drill at random from either side of the card and from
the  data file. At times the computer's response may take a few seconds due to
the  random factor. Also, it seems that the longer the list(such as 100 inputs)

the better the random functuion works.

Option 3, in this case is  used to drill on  verb  conjugations  although  any
long string messages can be used such as names and addresses, product name and
descriptions, client name and brief info about him, etc.

As this program stands,any data file can be loaded in and from Basic for faster

cassette access  due  to  the automatic line numbering.

Below is a list of  Spanish verbs  that can be drilled on with option 2.Use the

edit keys to utilize this list.
