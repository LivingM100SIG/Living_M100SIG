          The data-element reference section describes each of the four
          major data types that TMPC manipulates: the to-do, the fixed-date
          item, the weekly-repeating item, and the monthly-repeating item.


                                      The To-Do

          The purpose of the to-do it to record a task to be done, or a
          task "to do", whence its name.  Screens that manipulate to-dos
          are screens 1, 4, 7, and 11; screens 5 and 8 report information
          about to-dos.

          A specific flow of information is associated with a to-do.  When
          inspiration or circumstance first originates the idea of doing
          some task, you enter a description of a new to-do on screen 1. 
          It then waits in the "warehouse", a storage area, until you rank
          it (see below).  Eventually, you select it as something to be
          done today, and move it to a daily list; at this point, it
          becomes a constant reminder to you until you complete the task,
          cancel it, or return it to the warehouse.  Its final form is a
          note in the diary.  This process may take place in a short time
          (as with a task which quickly arises and is simply done), or it
          may extend for weeks or even months (as with a low-priority
          project resulting from a midnight inspiration).


          Attributes

          The to-do has three attributes: a description, a priority, and a
          stress rating.  The description must consist of 63 characters or
          less, and cannot include characters with ASCII codes less than 32
          ("control" characters).  The priority classifies the urgency of
          the task into three categories; you are free to attribute
          whatever meanings you want to them.  The stress grade classifies
          the difficulty of doing the task; again, you determine the exact
          meanings.  You must assign both a priority and a stress grade to
          a to-do (called "ranking" the to-do) before you can select it for
          the daily list.

                        Reference Section Two: Data Elements



                                 The Fixed-Date Item

          Unlike the to-do, which has no specific date associated with it,
          the fixed-date item resembles an entry in a date book.  The word
          "item" refers to two things at once: an appointment, which has a
          specific time associated with it, and a memo, which is a reminder
          associated with a date.

          There is little difference between appointments and memos.  TMPC
          makes no attempt to sort appointments by the time of day; you
          must keep them in order as you enter them (see the section
          Entering an Item, in the Procedure Reference Section above).  The
          only distinction between appointments and memos is that an
          appointment's description begins with a digit (0-9), while a memo
          begins with some other character.  This means that you should not
          begin a memo description with a number.  Appointments and memos
          each appear in their own section of the item list in screen 6.

          A fixed-date item has a particular time sequence associated with
          it.  At some point, you enter it using screen 9.  From then on,
          it is present as a reminder in either the appointments or memos
          section of the daily list - they will appear whenever you select
          the date when they entered.  For example: today is March 9. You
          enter an appointment for March 17.  It will appear as a reminder
          whenever you examine the item list  for March 17.  Then, once the
          date of the item is past, TMPC removes it from  the item list and
          puts it into the diary (if the diary is disable, TMPC merely
          deletes the entry).  Consequently, after an appointment date is
          past, there is no record of it in the item list.


          Attributes

          The only real attribute that an item can have is a warning, which
          creates deadline entries in the days preceding the date of the
          item.  For instance, if you must submit a paper on September 19,
          1985, and you want a reminder of its impending deadline, you can
          enter a memo on September 19, 1985 entitled "paper due" and give
          this memo a warning of, say, 10 days.  Then, each of the 10 days
          preceding September 19, 1985 will show the days left until "paper
          due".

                        Reference Section Two: Data Elements

          You have the further option of specifying a warning in terms of
          business days ("bdays") or calendar days ("cdays").  A business
          day is a weekday, excluding holidays.  In the above example, if
          the warning were type "C" (cdays), the deadlines would begin in
          the September 9, 1985 item list.  If the warning were type "B"
          (bdays), the deadlines would begin in the September 5, 1985 item
          list.

          There is a special case of a warning.  If an item has a warning
          type of "B" and no warning period (i.e., 0 days), the item is
          taken as a business holiday.  So, to enter Christmas as a
          business holiday, put a memo on December 25, give it a warning
          type "B" and leave the warning period at 0.  The table below
          summarizes the types of warnings:



               Type           No. Days = 0   No. Days = n
               Cdays          No Warning     Deadlines begin n calendar
                                             days before item.

               Bdays          Business       Deadlines begin n business
                              Holiday        days before item.


          The Procedure Reference Section contains detailed information
          about entering, editing, and removing single-entry items.


                               Weekly Repeating Items

          weekly repeating items allow you to make one entry for repetitive
          items in your schedule, provided they are scheduled by weeks in
          every month.  For example: you go to a Bible class every Thursday
          evening; a civic club meets every third Tuesday for lunch;
          newspaper recycling pickups are on Tuesday and Thursday in the
          last week of every month.

          Weekly-repeating items are very much like single-date items. You
          enter them the same way; they can be memos or appointments; they
          can have warnings; and they are listed in the diary for each date
          when they appear.  however, there are three very important
          differences:


             # After you enter an item, you must specifically activate
               screen 13 and set the repeating parameters for it to be a
               weekly-repeating item.

                        Reference Section Two: Data Elements

             # You cannot "cut" or "paste" weekly-repeating appointments
               using the item list "c" and "p" boxes.  See screen 6 in the
               Screen Reference section for more details.

             # TMPC will never automatically remove a weekly-repeating
               item.  After each date passes with an entry, TMPC will add a
               note of it to the diary, but it will not remove the item.


          Weekly-repeating items always appear below the single-date items
          in the item list, regardless of when and where you enter them. 
          This is a software limitation, and it means that you will not
          always be able to show your appointments in order through the
          day.

          For more information about how to set the date for a
          weekly-repeating item, see screen 13 in the Screen Reference
          section.


                               Monthly Repeating Items

          A monthly-repeating item is very similar to a weekly repeating
          item.  There are only two major differences:


             # A monthly-repeating item allows you to set item dates by
               days of the month.  For example: your birthday, which comes
               once per year, and your paycheck, if it comes on the 15th
               and the last day of every month.  You must activate screen
               14 to set monthly-repeating dates, as opposed to screen 13
               for weekly repeating dates.

             # TMPC list monthly-repeating items after single-date items
               and weekly-repeating items in the item list.


          In every other way, monthly-repeating items are the same as
          weekly-repeating items.

                          Reference Section Three: Screens

          The screen reference section describes each of TMPC's fourteen
          screens: what they do and what they show.  It lists each screen
          in numerical order, and each in a similar format.  The screen
          numbers are arbitrary; the arrangement is as follows:


                                  ENTER           
                                    |

                                Information Presented

          This screen displays the three major attributes of a to-do: the
          description in a text-display area, the stress at the lower left,
          and the priority at the lower right.

          If you enter the screen from screen 2, there will never be a
          to-do displayed.  Instead, the text-display area will be empty,
          and both the stress grade and the priority will be unassigned. 
          If you enter this screen from screen 4, the to-do that was
          selected in screen 4 will be displayed in screen 1.


                                      Functions

          There are three major functions available in this screen:


             # Change Priority.  From indicated stick-figure position,
               press [Left-Arrow].  After this, pressing [Down-Arrow] will
               change priorities; they will cycle from "unassigned" to
               "priority 1" to "priority 2" to "priority 3".

             # Change Stress Grade.  From indicated stick-figure position,
               press [Left-Arrow] [Left-Arrow].  After this, pressing
               [Down-Arrow] will change stress grade; it will cycle from
               "unassigned" to "Grade A" to "Grade B" to "Grade C".

               [Up-Arrow].  TMPC will enter the TEXT program; the active
               file will contain the text found in the text-description
               area.  Change the text as you wish.  Deleting all of the
               text will eliminate the to-do from the warehouse.  Adding
               new text, separated from any existing text with [ENTER],
               will create new to-dos.  Changing the existing text will
               update the description of the existing to-do.


                                        Exits

          To exit from the screen, press [Right-Arrow] to move to screen 2,
          or [Down-Arrow] to move to screen 4.  Exiting the screen saves
          any changes made to the to-do.  If a new priority or stress grade
          changes a to-do's position in the warehouse, screen 4 will
          select the to-do after the old position.

          This screen shows three pieces of information.  First, it shows
          today's date (the value that DATE$ returns in BASIC) and the
          weekday.  Second, if today is a business holiday, it shows the
          name of the holiday.  Finally, it shows the day number in the
          year (sometimes called the "Julian date"), and how many days are
          remaining in the year.  All of this information appears in the
          upper left corner of the screen.


                                      Functions
