		   Documentation for DBLDR.100

	    Source version DB6.2 of October 13, 1984

			     Credits

First, for starting this thing off I would like to thank Don Corbitt
[75655,1516] for writing PSEUDO.MAC and releasing it to the SIG for
personal use.  Thanks also go to Rick Perry [75665,1045] for the
excellent SORT.CO package.

			   Commentary

With Don's PSEUDO we got the ability to use any .DO file as a database,
lifting the restrictions of ADDRSS and SCHEDL to their respective ADRS
and NOTE files.  We also gained the ADD function which let us put more
data into a file without having to drop back to the text editor.  This
was fine, but to delete anything we still had to go to the text editor. 
Sorting required use of a seperate program (more stuff to fill memory). 
And, if we wanted to use a file other than ADRS for phone number
storage, well, that was still more software.

I took a look at this state of affairs and decided that I wanted the
whole shooting match in one package in order to less fill the memory in
Herman, my M100.  My original goal was to use 512 bytes or less, but in
the 800 and some odd bytes I ended up with I managed to squeeze in:

	- Don's Pseudo with ADD
	- Rick's SORT.CO
	- record deletion
	- auto-dial and logon
	- the ability to switch to different files

It turns out that, when a record is formatted for a phone number with a
logon sequence attached, the built-in auto-dial routine will drop right
through and do the log-on function.  Since I wanted to use this program
with my ADRS file, I didn't add the carrier-detect/busy detect/no answer
detect code (I did try).

			   Setting Up

You have all you need to start with DBLDR.100.  DOWnload DBLDR.100 as
DBLDR.DO.  LOAD DBLDR.DO and SAVE it as DBLDR.BA. RUN DBLDR and it
will create the two files DB.BA and DB.CO that form the database
handler.

To run the program, just select DB.BA from the menu or RUN"DB" from
BASIC.
			    Operation

When you start DB you are shown the directory of files in your machine
and asked to select a ".DO" file.  If the file exists in memory, it is
opened and you can continue with DB.  When the file is non-existant you
are given the option to open it as a new file. A "No" response puts you
back to the startup display. A "Yes" response tells the program to
create a new file.  Should there be no more room in the directory, you
are informed of this and the program exits to the MENU to allow you to
clear out old/unwanted files.

The main operating display is the prompt "DB:". Here you can use any of
the options provided by the function keys.

			  Function Keys

F1 - FIND

This key works in a manner similar to the Find key in TELCOM.  Enter the
search string and  <ENTER> after hitting F1 or typing in FIND.  The line
containing the search string is displayed if any is found and the
function keys active under FIND are displayed.


F2 - MORE

Hitting this key, the space bar, M or m prompts DB to look for the next
occurrence of the search string.

F3 - DELE

Hitting F2, D, or d tells DB to delete the displayed data.  Before doing
the actual delete, however you are asked "OK to DELETE?".  A yes
response causes the data to be deleted, any other respopnse aborts the
deletion and takes you back to the DB: prompt. 

F4 - CALL

If there is a phone number in the displayed data (formatted as in the
ADRS file) DB will dial it.  Should the number also have an auto logon
sequence appended DB logs you onto the system it called and drops into
TELCOM.

F8 - QUIT

Handy exit key takes you back to the main DB display.


F2 - ADD

Hit F2 and type a string of data up to 240 characters long. When you hit
<ENTER> the string is added to the top of the file. The bell sounds and
the M100 stops accepting data when the input line hits 254 characters so
you can't overrun the input string buffer.

F3 - SORT

This is Rick Perry's SORT.CO shoe-horned into DB. It sorts the lines in
the file based on the first characters of each entry.

F5 - LFND

This key is identical to LFND in ADDRSS and SCHEDL

F6 - FILE

The name of this function may be a bit misleading. It allows you the
option of switching to another file in memory.  Hitting F6 takes you
back to the startup display of DB.

F8 - MENU 

Clean up and go home


L

If there is a phone number in the displayed data (formatted as in the
ADRS file) DB will dial it.  S
