DUAT.100- WEATHER MODEL100 DUAT DOWNLOAD FOR TRS80 MODEL 100, 102

DUAT.100 was created to automate the downloading of specific "weather
products" from CONTEL DUAT service in early 1990. Some familiarity with the
100's logon string and TELCOM program, is assumed. DUAT.100 controls all the
communications routine from BASIC by CALLing the com routines as required. It
is based on a program I wrote during the FAA's experimental phase when the
DUAT prototypes were being tested, and so has been more-or-less in use for
some time in this earlier guise.)

By early summer, 1990, all the DUAT providers were pumping out weather data,
airport and enroute information, warnings, notices, and so on used by the
aviation community, but often with an unbelievable, unnecessary "data
overkill". Many pilots haul out their laptops or microcomputers, log on to
the service, then request menu items that suggest they'll get just the
weather data they need for a planned flight. In the process, they must
patiently wait online while they are admonished not to carry the remains of
former President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. And during summer
afternoons they receive mandatory tornado warnings for the central twister
belt even though their planned route lies in Maine or Oregon. Now, DUAT.100
allows pilots with model 100's or 102's to specify as much or little
information as they require, and then it GETS the info without fooling
around.

The above brief background suggests that pilots KNOW what they want in the
way of weather data. If this is you, then DUAT.100 will obviate those
frustrations! If you forgot to request a terminal forcast, or want to see
whether it's changed, then when you run DUAT.100, you can request that FT
all by itself.

The best weather-briefing outside standing in the Flight Service Station
live, is obtained from EMI AeroComp here on CIS. I consider it the "reference
standard," and it's so GOOD you just won't find any regular pilot/users who
can fault it. (At least as far as today's state of WX briefings is
concerned.) The Contel version of the DUAT weather-and-briefing service is,
however, the best one going. I've tried them all.

DUAT has built-in protections to discourage access by non-pilots, so to use
the service you need to BE one. To get started on this service, have your
PILOT CERTIFICATE NUMBER handy, then connect your modem to 1 800 767- 9989.
Set communications protocols for any baud rate from 300 to 2400. The system
is sophisticated enough to detect and accommodate your preference in parity
and word length, but I find "none" and "8" respectively are the defaults.
Other combinations will probably work OK, but you can see the host program
saying, "Oh, aah, yeah, even parity, 7 bits, OK, stand by one..." Follow the
prompts for first-time users, call their 800 help number if you need to, and
try it in the non-automatic mode for a while. To use DUAT.100 on Contel DUAT
most successfully, go back online and set your user defaulte to a
40-character screen width for the MODEL100, and set screen size for the
highest number it will accept. (I never found the "scroll all" command on
Contel! I just tell it my screen accommodates 512 lines....)

DUAT.100 has been reasonably debugged and works very well on the TANDY TRS80
MODEL 100 and compatibles. It uses the CALL statement abundantly to access
screen, UART and COM functions directly from BASIC. These CALL locations are
specific to the 100 and 102, but they make screen and com handling very nice!
All of the CALL addresses can be found in "Hidden Powers of the TRS80 Model
100" by Christopher L. Morgan (pub. Waite)

After making the changes noted below to accommodate your personal signon
defaults, connect your MODEL 100 to the telephone network, and set the
answer/originate switch to "originate." It should not be necessary to set the
communications parameters in TELCOM (They are M8N1E): these are done for you
by CALLing routines that first initialise the UART and then set up the
protocols for you. (Line 190: CALL28326,0,785. The "785" sets switches for
300 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.)

Line 40 contains the 800 access number for CONTEL DUAT as well as the signon
string. This string is EXACTLY the same one you keep in ADRS.DO to find and
call the service automatically; however the string is concatenated from a
couple of string fragments with PW$ and AC$ stored in line 10. Edit line 10
to change these strings to equal YOUR password and access code. After that,
you may go so far as to edit line 40, where you can reconstruct the single
logon string to incorporate your own password and access. At that time, you
should remove them from line 10. Delete lines 1-7 if you want. Lines 20 and
30 should stay at the top of the program code: BASIC scans for line numbers
in GOTO statements, and it should find the address quickly near the
beginning. Otherwise, it may be hard to keep up with the data flow when the
program is loading your weather data.

Run the program. The first screen wants you to enter a "LOCID." This is a
3-letter "LOCATION IDENTIFIER" such as VNY or SNA. One or two of the letters
can be a number. It won't take 4-character strings. Press backspace if you
goof and want to re-enter, then re-enter the ENTIRE 3-character LOCID. If you
enter AIRPORT IDENTIFIERS, you can enter as many as you like. Press ENTER
when you have entered your last location request.

The screen then clears and shows you a menu of weather products. Select 1 or
more of these with FUNCTION KEYS. Note the audible feedback. Press F8 when
you have chosen what you want. DUAT.100 then logs onto DUAT, gets your
requested items, signs off, and gives you a the data one screenful at a time.
Press the spacebar to view each screen. Feel free to route the output to a
printer by changing PRINT to LPRINT in line 270.

As you may know, or learn, you can't request all weather products at all
location identifiers. You gotta use a little sense! If you ask for WINDS
ALOFT, for example, at an AIRPORT LOCATION, then DUAT will say "soandso does
not report this weather type. Therefore, as a general rule ---

If you enter AIRPORT IDENTIFIERS, you can REQUEST Hourly reports, terminal
forecasts, notams, pireps. (CONTEL DUAT is pretty smart, and does an
excellent job of delivering UA's within probably 50 miles of the airport(s)
you select. It is a nice feature.) If you enter VOR's you can request winds
aloft. (These are pretty neat, too.) If you enter RADAR WEATHER sites you can
request RADAR WEATHER. The only radar weather sites around where I live are
VQN (Volens, Virginia) and NHK (Patuxent Naval Air Station or Japan
Broadcasting Company). I guess BPT is also one of these. Check your FSS.
