                             Documentation for TIMSHT.BA 

               TIMSHT.BA is an automatic timekeeping program for the Model 
          100.  The program was originally written to track the time spent 
          on various projects throughout the day, tallying the time in 
          quarter hour increments for output to a line printer and, 
          eventually, using the print out for customer invoicing.  The 
          program will track time while you are using your computer to 
          perform other tasks, or while the computer is turned off.  There 
          is plenty of room for improvement, especially in the wrap around 
          of the description column in the printout, so please feel free 
          to make modifications. 


                                    Function Keys 

               <F1> - Starts the automatic timing process by recording the 
          current time and other information in TTIME.DO. 

               <F2> - Stops the timer, computes the difference between the 
          current time and that in TTIME.DO and records the information in 
          TIMDAT.DO. 

               <F3> - Prompts user for information to be appended to 
          TIMDAT.DO manually. 

               <F4> - Prompts user for the date to be used on the header 
          of the printout. *NOTE* Change Line 590 to reflect your name. 

               <F5> - Erases the contents of TIMDAT.DO after double 
          checking with the user. 

               <F8> - Goes to Model 100 Menu.
