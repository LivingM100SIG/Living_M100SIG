This program is designed to score yacht races, to compute
standings, and to present the results in order. It has not
 yet been developed to print to a printer, only to the 
screen, so the user will have to use pencil and paper to 
record the results on hard copy. 
     The program will score either PHRF or Portsmouth, and 
is DIMENSIONED to compute up to six races (including 
throw-out races) with up to 30 racers in each race. It is 
limited by the DIMension statement and, of course, by 
available memory. It gives 3/4 point to the winner, and 
points equal to the finish position of all other racers. It 
handles ties by dividing the total points of both finishing 
positions between the tying racers.
   DNS = number of racers plus one.
   DNF and DSQ = number of finishers 
      plus one.
The program has not been collapsed to remove remark 
statements and spaces at this point, for ease of 
understanding and ease of modification. 
   Copyright: enjoy. I developed this program when I was 
race committee chairman of our local sailing club, and used 
it on my model III for some years. I modified it for the 
model 100 and invite any sail racing buff to do with it what
he/she wants. I make no warranty as to its performance or 
value, and say only that I have enjoyed writing and using 
it.

   Most of the program is menu driven. The screen will first
 ask if you wish to score PHRF or Portsmouth. You will, once
 that information is in the system, be given the choice to 
input race data, finish data, or to score races.

RACE DATA INPUT:
Note that all time is military time. The original program 
had a conversion subroutine, but that limited the program 
too much. In this way, even races taking more than 24 hours 
can be computed, simply by ensuring that the number of 
elapsed hours is correct. e.g. a race which begins at 1:00 
p.m. on Monday, with the first finisher coming in at 2:12:23
p.m. on Tuesday would be scored:
   Time of Start: 13:00:00--
   Time of Finish: 38:12:23
Currently, the longest race which can be scored is that of 
48 hours. However, if you wish to score longer races, you 
can easily restructure the program. The code is in line 
1720, the number 2880 representing the maximum minutes in 
the system. (2880/60 = 48) If you wish to set the limit at 
36 hours, you change that number to 2160, if you wish a 60 
hour time maximum, set the code at 3660. 
    For PHRF, you will need the distance in nautical miles, 
since that handicap system is designed for a time on 
distance computation. For Portsmouth, since it is a time on 
time computation, the distance is not necessary.

FINISH DATA INPUT
Unfortunately, there is a good bit of repetition here. For 
each racer, you will be asked the Name, the Racer Number, 
the handicap number, the number of the race being entered 
and the time of finish. THE RACER NUMBER IS EXTREMELY 
IMPORTANT! This is the counter on which everything else 
depends. Therefore, it must the number, in order, of the 
racer you are scoring. For example, if you have seven 
racers, you assign a number between one and seven to each 
racer. While the computation program is executing, it will 
count by racer number. If you designate a contestant as 
racer number three, then everything entered with that number
will be assigned to that racer-- even a different name!
   Once the finish information has been completed, you have 
one last chance to double check the information--the program
will ask if the information is correct.
   If, later on, you feel you have made a mistake, simply 
re-enter the information for that particular finish over 
again; any existing information will be replaced by the new 
information entered.
     After all the information is entered, enter NONE and 
you will go back to the menu. The information is stored in 
the RAM file "Racer.do", so additional information can be 
later added. Race information (e.g. race number, time of 
start, and distance for PHRF) is not stored and must be 
re-entered every time the program is re-booted. 
    You have the option to score a single race, a number of 
races, or total the entire regatta. You cannot use the last 
option until you have scored all the races. If you are 
scoring a regatta, you must first use option number 4, then,
when all races have been scored, you may go to option five 
and score the entire regatta. This is because the points are
assigned only through options 3 and 4, and for all the races
only by option 4.
     There is, I confess, one "minor" problem on printout of
results, both of races and of the entire regatta. Because of
the counter mechanism, if there is a tie, you may lose the 
top line off the screen. I'm still working on the solution 
to that one. If you find it a problem and are interested in 
trying to solve it, the program segments are:
   1. 1600-1630 and 1740-1785 for the individual races, and 
   2. 2710-2765 for the entire regatta.
