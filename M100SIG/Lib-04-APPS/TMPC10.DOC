                                Information Presented

          This screen displays three one-month calendars.  The central
          calendar always holds the current date, which is the date that
          you examine for appointments and deadlines.  Note that the
          current date differs from "today", which can only be changed in
          BASIC.  Whenever you enter screens 2 or 5, you reset the current
          date to today.

          Some of the dates on the three calendars are highlighted in
          inverse video.  You can select which of three criteria TMPC will
          use to highlight dates:


             # Dates that are business holidays (besides Saturdays and
               Sundays),

             # Dates with appointments, or

             # Dates with appointments or memos.


          Note that, if you have TMPC highlight dates with appointments, it
          will highlight business holidays as well.

          The current date (which always appears in the center calendar)
          flashes.  If the current date would be highlighted, it flashes
          faster than if it would not be.

                                      Functions

          There are two basic functions in the appointment calendar screen. 
          The first is to select which dates are highlighted.  Pressing
          [Up-Arrow] will cause the highlighting to cycle between "none"
          (no highlighting), "appt" (appointments), and "ent" (any entry
          except deadlines).

          The second function of the appointment calendar is to select the
          current date.  To change the current date, press [Right-Arrow].
          the stick-figure will move into the dead end block to the right
          and the following cursor keys will become active:


          [Left-Arrow]             Move backward one day.
          [Right-Arrow]            Move forward one day.
          [Up-Arrow]               Move backward one week.
          [Down-Arrow]             Move forward one week.
          [Shift] [Left-Arrow]     Move backward one month.
          [Shift] [Right-Arrow]    Move forward one month.
          [Shift] [Up-Arrow]       Move to next previous highlighted date.
          [Shift] [Down-Arrow]     Move to next highlighted date.
          [CTRL] [Left-Arrow]      Move back one year
          [CTRL] [Right-Arrow]     Move forward one year.
          [CTRL] [Up-Arrow]        Move to today.
          [CTRL] [Down-Arrow]      Move to last date with a single-date
                                   item (repeating items go forever).


          To return the cursor keys to their normal function, press [ENTER]


                                        Exits

          There are two exits from screen 3.  Pressing [Left-Arrow] moves
          to screen 2, which also resets the current date to today. 
          Pressing [Down-Arrow] moves to screen 6, which displays a list
          of the appointments, memos, and deadlines for the current date.

          This screen shows the to-dos in the warehouse.  If there are more
          than will fit on the screen, the screen shows a portion of them,
          and the numbers above and below the arrows indicate how many are
          above and below the displayed portion, respectively.  The to-dos
          are grouped by priority; the unassigned to-dos appear in their
          own section at the top of the list.  Within each section, the
          to-dos appear in reverse order of stress: grade C stress first,
          then grade B stress, then grade A stress.

          On to-do always appears in reverse video.  It is the selected
          to-do.  This is the to-do that you would modify if you moved to
          screen 1, or the one where selection starts in screen 7.


                                      Functions

          There are two basic function of this screen: viewing to-dos in
          the warehouse and selecting them for manipulation.  The three
          boxes ("+", "-", and "p") all move the selected to-do and display
          a different portion of the warehouse.  Moving into the "+" box
          with [Right-Arrow] move the selected to-do down one in the list;
          moving into the "-" box with [Left-Arrow] moves the selected
          to-do up one in the list.  The "p" box moves the list forward by
          one page.

                                Information Presented

          This screen displays the items for the current date.  The list
          has the following structure:


            1. If there are any appointments, there is a header line above
               them.

            2. The appointments, if any, for the date.  The order is the
               order in which you enter them, except that all
               weekly-repeating appointments will be after all single-date
               appointments, and all monthly-repeating appointments will be
               after all weekly-repeating appointments.

            3. If there are any memos, there is a header line above them.

            4. The memos, if any, for the date.  The order is the order in
               which you enter them, except that all weekly-repeating memos
               will be after all single-date memos, and all
               monthly-repeating memos will be after all weekly-repeating
               memos.

            5. If there are any deadlines active for the current date,
               there will be a header line above them.

            6. The deadlines will be listed in time order, with the
               earliest deadlines first.  However, this order is based on
               the calendar time, not the number of business days.  Each
               deadline appears with its number of "bdays" (business days)
               or "cdays" (calendar days) left before the deadline.

                                      Functions

          There are four basic functions of this screen.  The first two are
          viewing items for the current date and selecting them for
          manipulation.  Three boxes ("+", "-", and "p") all move the
          selected item and display a different portion of the item list. 
          Moving into the "+" box with the [Right-Arrow] moves the selected
          item down one in the list; moving into the "-" box with the
          [Left-Arrow] moves the selected item up one in the list.  The "p"
          box moves the list forward by one page.

          The other two functions of the screen are cutting and pasting. 
          These functions allow you to delete, copy, and rearrange
          single-date items without using screen 9.  To "cut" (remove from
          the list and put into a buffer) a single-date item from the list,
          select it, then move into the "c" box with the [Right-Arrow]. 
          The selected item will disappear, and the "p" box will appear,
          indicating that there is something in the buffer.  Moving to any
          screen except screen 3, or "cutting" again, will clear the
          buffer.  To "paste" (deposit the buffer), select the item before
          which you want the buffer to go, and enter the "p" box with
          [Right-Arrow].  You may change the selected date (with screen 3)
          before pasting.


                                        Exits

          There are three exits from screen 6.  Pressing [Up-Arrow] moves
          to screen 3, which allows you to change the current date. 
          Pressing [Down-Arrow] moves to screen 9, which allows you to
          change the item selected in the list.  Pressing [Left-Arrow]
          moves to screen 5, which resets the current date to today and
          clears the "paste" buffer.
