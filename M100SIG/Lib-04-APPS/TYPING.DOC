TYPING.BA was written to introduce the beginning typist to the keyboard.  
TYPING.BA reads from a file you must create and entitle TEST.DO.  TEST.DO must 
contain lines of 79 characters or less.  There must be a minimum of 2 lines of 
text, no blank lines, no commas, quotes, or semicolons.  

The first two lines of the screen show the line of text you are to type.  Lines 
4 and 5 show an underline for each character or space your are to type.  On the 
next to the last line of the screen a running total of the number of "right" 
keys pressed, "wrong" keys pressed and the score in percent are recorded.  In 
the lower center of the screen the "proper finger" is indicated, that should 
strike each letter.  This is where "Touch Typing" gets its name.  
As you finish typing each line your words per minute are shown.  The next line 
is then read from TEST.DO displayed for you to type.  All of the above 
information is recorded in a text document called RESULT.DO.  This is useful for
seeing your progress over a period of time.  When the last line is displayed 
"The End" is displayed and you will be escorted back to the Main Menu.  The 
ESCAPE key, at any time, will return you to the main menu.

The home keys are the the keys that your fingers "rest" on.  When you see the 
finger and key combination on the screen move that finger to the proper key, 
press it and then move back to the home keys.  With correct typing procedure 
only the finger striking the key moves off of the home keys. The home keys and 
proper fingers are as follows:

   Left Hand                Right Hand
      "A"     little finger     ";"
      "S"      ring finger      "L"
      "D"     middle finger     "K"
      "F"      index finger     "J"

The thumbs "rest" above but not touching the "Space Bar"

 It will take several weeks of practice to master but, "one must endeavor to 
persevere" (the quote came from a Clint Eastwood movie I think). 

You may enter whatever type of drill in TEST.DO that you wish.  We use this not 
only for teaching typing but at the same time allowing self instruction in some 
other type of activity.  For example, we have 60 or so BASIC commands and their 
definitions in a file, this allows the student to learn to type and become 
familiar with some of the BASIC commands.
