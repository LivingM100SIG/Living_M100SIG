TIMING is a program to allow easy measurement of lap speed and lap time, and 
average speed and total time for any kind of race or event taking place over a 
measured distance in a measured time.

The display shows up to 4 laps simultaneously on a Model 100 or 102 and up to 12
laps on a Tandy 200;  after the display is full, it scrolls so that only the 
most recent laps are seen.

Timing was designed specifically for bicycle criterium racing where lap times 
are on the order of two minutes but will work with almost any kind of race and 
other uses can probably be imagined.

The number of laps is limited to 99.  The program shows a running display of lap
time and total time in addition to the data about each lap as it occurs.  At the
conclusion of the race, the computer operator has the option of starting over 
for a new race, reviewing the existing data, or quitting back to the system 
menu.

A typical display looks like this:


=======================================
Lap# Lap Time  Speed  Tot Time  Avg Spd
---------------------------------------
  1    0: 1:52   31.9   0: 1:52    31.9
  2    0: 1:55   31.0   0: 3:49    31.4
  3    0: 2:34   23.2   0: 6:24    28.1

   [up to 12 laps shown on Tandy 200
           4 laps on Model 100/102]

----------------------------------------Lap time = 0:23    Total time = 0: 6:58

INSTRUCTIONS
Download the file TIMING.100 from Library 4 or TIMING.200 from Library 10.  Load
the file into BASIC and RUN it.  TIMING will prompt you for lap length and 
number.  Press any key as the race starts and again at the end of each lap.

If you forget to press a key at the end of a lap, press it when you remember.  
That lap and the next one will be timed incorrectly but the average and total 
will remain correct for the rest of the race.  The program can be stopped at any
time with a Control-C or BREAK command.

You may notice that the lap time and total time counters at the bottom of the 
screen skip from 7 seconds to 9 seconds with out displaying 8 seconds.  I don't 
know why this occurs and would appreciate hearing from anyone who does.  It may 
have something to do with round-off errors.
