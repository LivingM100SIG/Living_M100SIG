THIS FILE, WHEN LOADED INTO MINIVC.WM3, 
WILL ALLOW THE CALCULATION OF SAMPLE 
STANDARD DEVIATION, VARIANCE, AND 
STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEAN ON A SAMPLE 
OF UP TO 18 VALUES. AFTER DOWNLOADING 
THE FILE MUST BE EDITED SO THE TOP LINE 
(20  5  3  0) IS THE TRUE TOP LINE OF 
THE FILE, AND INDENTED ONE SPACE. ON 
LOADING, A <CALC ERROR><ENT> MESSAGE 
WILL APPEAR (BECAUSE THERE ARE NO VALUES
IN SOME OF THE CELLS). HIT <ENTER>, THEN
"/" FOLLOWED BY "M" AND THE SCREEN WILL 
APPEAR. TO USE THE TEMPLATE SIMPLY ENTER
VALUES OF X INTO COLUMN A, THEN HIT "!" 
FOR CALCULATION OF RESULTS. MANY THANKS 
TO WOODS MARTIN, WHO REALLY DID THE WORK
ON THIS..RICK DAVIDSON
