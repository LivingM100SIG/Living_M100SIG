MLIST.100 lets you add, search, and 
print names and addresses in ADRS file. 
The program is driven by following 
menus; use arrow keys to move the cursor
and hit a [ENTER]:

  SYSEM MENU
   FILER  SUBSYSTEM - adds names to an
                      ADRS file
   SEARCH SUBSYSTEM - lists names on
                      the screen
   PRINT  SUBSYSTEM - prints names on
                      the printer
   EXIT             - does what it says

  FILER SUBSYSTEM
   Enter data at each prompt.  Pressing
   [ENTER] at a "LAST NAME" prompt
   returns to the SYSTEM MENU.  At the
   next menu, you may correct your
   entries, or proceed to the next menu.


  SEARCH SUBSYSTEM
   SYSTEM MENU   - returns to the
                   SYSTEM MENU
   WHOLE LIST    - lists entire file
   SELECTED LIST - selects a search
                   field

  PRINT SUBSYSTEM
   Same as the SEARCH SUB MENU.

  SELECT FIELD
   You can select a field for search or
   print.  For example, if you are
   looking for people who live in San
   Francisco, select a "CITY" and
   enter "San Francisco" or just "Fran"
   if you don't know how to spell it.

  SEARCH OPTION
   SEARCH SUBSYSTEM - returns to the
                      subsystem menu
   NAME             - lists names only
   NAME & TEL       - lists names and 
                      TEL #'s
   NAME & ADDRESS   - lists names and
                      addresses
   ALL              - lists everything

  PRINT OPTION
   PRINT SUBSYSTEM - returns to the
                     subsystem menu
   ON LABEL        - prints on mailing
                     labels
                     (TEL # not printed)

   LISTING         - pritns listings

If you have telephone number for
database like CompuServe which does not
have address, place a GRAPH or CODE
character, whose ASC value is larger
than 127, before the name; it would not
be searched or printed by the program.
You might have to change line 1310 to
make it linefeed to the next mailing
label.  The ADRS file created by this
program can be used by both ADDRSS and
TELCOM software in Model 100.
