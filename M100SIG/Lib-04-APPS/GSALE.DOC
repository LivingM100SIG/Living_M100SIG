***** Garage Sale Computer *****

This program allows a person to use his/her TANDY 200
as a helpful tool in running a garage sale.
The program allows from 1 to 4 families to participate.
Each family is assigned a "code letter" to use...for example:
The Smith's put an 'A' on every price tag next to the price.
The Jone's put a 'B' on every tag.
The codes are A,B,D, or D.
When the program is run, 4 files are opened, AAA,BBB,CCC,DDD. These
files keep track of sales for the four families.

---- Running the program ----
Tab to GSALE.BA and press ENTER.
After the program initializes, there will be a blank table
on the screen.  At this point, you can either start totalizing the
items a customer purchases, or you can view the Status of your present sales.
Note: you must have at least 1 sale before veiwing the Status.

Let's say a customer selects 10 items to purchase....
You look at the price tag of item 1 and type: 3.50 
You must enter the decimal point too.
Note:  The highest number = 999.99 or 5 digits.
If you make an error in entering the number, use the DEL/BKSP key to correct.
After entering the 3.50, press the Family code key..A,B,C or D.
NO NEED TO PRESS THE ENTER KEY.
The item will appear on the table and the running Subtotal will appear.
Enter the next item...
If you press the Family Code (the item appears on table), and you've
realized you entered the wrong price or family code, press the 'E' key.
This is the (E)rror command and will erase the last entry made.
The 'E' key will also adjust the Subtotal.
The Errored entry will be blanked out.

Once all of the 10 items were entered, you can press the 'T' key (T)otal command.
Note: You can only enter up to 30 items per customer.  If the customer
has more than 30 items, you must Totalize before continuing.

---- (T)otal command ----
When you press the T key, the total will appear in the first box.
Now you can enter the Amount Tendered...this is how much
money the customer gives you to pay for the items.
If you make a mistake entering the amount tendered, use the DEL/BKSP key
to erase numbers....or you can press the 'E' key (E)rror key to start over.
If you accidently entered the 'T' key in the first place...press 'A' key to
ABORT the T command. No information will
be logged, and you will return to the table screen as it was before
you entered the 'T' key by mistake.

After the Amount Tendered has been properly entered, press ENTER key
to Enter the amount.  The Change you
must return to the customer will
be shown as CHG.

Pressing ENTER will return for the next customer.

---- (S)tatus command ----
Pressing 'S' key while in the table screen, will allow you to veiw
how many sales have been made for each family code.
The info is taken from the files AAA,BBB,CCC,DDD.  These files get
updated after each (T) command.
The Status screen allows you to then Quit the program if you wish.

---- Nice features ----
The program logs each amount a customer buys for each family code.
Not only the amount, but the DATE and TIME are also logged.
You can start the program on a Friday, and continue till Sunday without
losing any sales data.

To clear out data, simply KILL the file for the family you want:

A code = AAA.DO file
B code = BBB.DO file
C code = CCC.DO file
D code = DDD.DO file

You can write data collection programs of your own if you wish using
the .DO files.
