            FLIGHT.BA and  the  companion  modules  were  written  using
       admittedly inaccurate  assumptions and  approximations,  some  of
       which are  discussed below.   I  make no  warranties of any kind,
       including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a partic-
       ular purpose.   These programs were written for my own entertain-
       ment.  Since I cannot prevent their change by some unknown person
       before they get to you, since I know that they rely upon approxi-
       mations which  are not  totally accurate,  and since,  in fact, I
       cannot even  be sure  that garbage  won't sneak in from the phone
       lines as  you download  them, I cannot know if they will work for
       you, but would be willing to bet that they won't.

            FLIGHT.BA and its modules were written for the TRS Model 100
       to take  the place  of the  slide rule  type  flight  "computer".
       Actually, these  are a  rewrite of  FLTCMP.BA,  which  I  earlier
       uploaded to  Compuserve.   The most  obvious difference  is  that
       FLTCMP.BA was  a single  program incorporating  all 8 of the pro-
       grams included  in FLIGHT.BA  and its  modules.    As  a  result,
       FLTCMP.BA was  huge.  FLIGHT.BA is a menu program which loads and
       runs various  modules depending  upon the choices you make in the
       menu.   I wanted  these programs to do everything the E6B can do,
       plus a few things it can't, like weight & balance.

            Another major change in FLIGHT.BA is a change in the naviga-
       tion calculations.   I  had used  rhumb line  formulas I  got off
       AVSIG, and  found that  if I plotted a course of either 90 or 270
       true, the did not work.  As the course approached either of those
       figures, the distance went off the scale.  I gave up on trying to
       get this  correct, and  have assumed that the earth is flat.  The
       course and  distance are calculated using simple plane trigonome-
       try and a constant of 60.1 nm per degree of latitude.  This seems
       to get  close enough  for light plane VFR flying, within a few nm
       over 400  nm and  within a few degrees of the charted course.  It
       may not  be exact, but it seems to work.  However, I am not about
       to take off, leave my charts at home, and simply fly the headings
       the program gives me.  This is only intended to be an aid, and in
       no way  can substitute  for either  good flight  planning or good
       piloting.

            There are  a total  of 8  programs included  in this  group.
       FLIGHT.BA (checksum  85054) is  the main menu program.  FLITE1.BA
       (checksum 171559)  converts from  one measure  to another  (e.g.,
       Fahrenheit to  Celsius, Knots to Mph, etc.).  FLITE2.BA (checksum
       67256) is a simple standard math calculator.  FLITE3.BA (checksum
       197223) is  the Time/Speed/Distance  module.  FLITE4.BA (checksum
       167609) is the Altitude and Airspeed module.  FLITE5.BA (checksum
       173379) is  the Wind  and  Drift  module.    FLITE6.BA  (checksum
       133228) is  the Weight  and Balance  module.  FLITE7.BA (checksum
       425416) is  the Navigation  module.   Note that if you do not use
       these names for the program modules, the menus won't work.
       





            FLIGHT pretty  much runs itself.  You move through the menus
       using the  up and  down arrow  keys.  The data for ident to ident
       navigation should  be stored in NAVAID.DO, an example of which is
       included at  the end  of this documentation.  The data fields are
       Ident, Description, Latitude North, Longitude West, Compass Vari-
       ation.   Latitude and longitude data are included in NAVAID.DO as
       decimal numbers,  but the  number to  the right of the decimal is
       not fractional  degrees, but  rather  the  minutes  of  latitude.
       Thus, 35  deg. 30 min. latitude would be included in NAVAID.DO as
       "35.30", and  not as  "35.50".   Compass variation,  on the other
       hand, is  in degrees  and fractional  degrees.   Thus, 10 deg. 45
       min. east  variation would  be stored  as "-10.75", and not as "-
       10.45", if  you want  to get that exact with the variations.  The
       program will  append new idents to your NAVAID.DO, so you can add
       idents that  way.  I have found it convenient to put the lat. and
       long. for  enroute checkpoints and other locations for which I do
       not have  an ident  into NAVAID.DO using an ident of XXXX.  Note,
       however, that  XXXX is  the only  ident that the program does not
       expect to  be unique.   For  that reason, for VORs which have the
       same ident  as an  airport, but which are not located at the same
       lat. and  long., I  add "v"  at the  end of  the ident (e.g., LAX
       would be  the airport,  and LAXv  would be the VOR).  The program
       does not  require you  to use  "v", and  you can develop your own
       method of dealing with similar idents.  Use the up and down arrow
       keys to scan through your NAVAID.DO idents.

            Each program  is relatively large for its functions, because
       of all  the screen  printing and menus.  All of them together are
       huge, and  therefore they are not something you would likely want
       to leave  stored in  RAM on  a permanent basis.  However, none of
       the programs are so large that you can't download them to a M100.
       The versions  described here  (with their  checksums) are  packed
       versions, which  helps some  on the  RAM usage,  but I  have  not
       really tried  to optimize  the code to reduce their size.  I have
       also unpacked versions if anyone wants to try to make the changes
       suggested below  or wants  to modify  these for an IBM compatible
       (such as a Toshiba he says, with lust in his voice).  If you want
       me to  upload the unpacked versions for direct download, leave me
       a message  and maybe I will do so.  I have not renumbered each of
       the program  modules to  the lowest  possible line  numbers  (and
       therefore the  lowest possible RAM requirements in ASCII) so that
       anyone who  wants to  merge them  all can see how everything fits
       together into one program.  However, I have made numerous changes
       in each  of  the  programs  since  I  broke  them  apart  out  of
       FLTCMP.BA, and  therefore a  straight merge  may  overwrite  some
       important coding.   You  might want to look at the Tandy 600 ver-
       sion I have written and uploaded to the Tandy 600 data library in
       this forum.
       





            If you  like this  program, or have suggestions on modifying
       it, let  me know  by leaving  me a message in either the AVSIG or
       the M100SIG  on Compuserve.   My  Compuserve ID is 73337,2600.  I
       may or  may not  acknowledge your message, as I get on Compuserve
       irregularly.  And, I may or may not make modifications based upon
       suggestions I  receive.   And, if  I do make the modifications, I
       may or  may not  upload the  modified version.   In  fact, if you
       think of  good modifications,  please make  them and upload a new
       version of this.  Suggestions for improvement:

       1.   Code actual  formulas for  pressure  and  density  altitude,
            instead of approximations derived from charts.

       2.   Combine the navigation and wind triangle functions to give a
            screen more  like the standard Pilot's Navigation Log/Flight
            Plan form (I did this on the Tandy 600 version).

       3.   Rewrite the  weight and  balance portion to use data for the
            plane you fly, or even several planes from which you choose,
            stored in a .DO file, rather than having to be keyed in each
            time.

            The formulas  for the  following quantities  were derived as
       linear  algebraic  (and  not  differential)  equations  from  the
       answers to  problems in  either the Private Pilot Test or the E6B
       instruction manual.   For  that reason,  the answers this program
       gives for  many of  these values  are only approximate.  At least
       some of these values are not linear.  For example, pressure alti-
       tude does not decrease at exactly 1000' (or even 910') per 1" Hg.
       The decrease changes as the pressure changes, and as a result the
       difference between  the correction factors for 28.0" Hg and 29.0"
       Hg is  greater than the difference between the correction factors
       for 30.0" Hg and 31.0" Hg.  Note lines 970-1020 of FLITE4.BA give
       six different formulas for calculating the approximate correction
       factor, depending upon the altimeter setting.

            The formulas  I have  derived are  those for  the  following
       unknowns:

       1.   Pressure Altitude-see  lines 970-1020  in FLITE4.BA.   PA  =
            Altitude +  ((29.92 - Altimeter Setting) x 910) + 46.8 + (60
            x (28.5  - Altimeter  Setting)) if Altimeter Setting is less
            than 28.5.

       2.   Density Altitude-see  line 1080 in FLITE4.BA.  Density Alti-
            tude = (Pressure Altitude x 0.9075) + (66 x Outside Tempera-
            ture - Standard Temperature)) + 256

       3.   Standard Temperature - see line 1080 in FLITE4.BA.  Standard
            Temperature = 59 - ((Pressure Altitude x 3.5)/1000).

       If someone  has more  accurate formulas for these values, I would
       appreciate getting  them.   Please leave them in a message to me,
       along with where you got them.
       





            Although I  have never  tried it, I assume that the programs
       will run  on a  M200.   The only calls included in these programs
       are to  turn the  cursor on  and off  for esthetic  purposes, and
       could be deleted for compatibility's sake.

            Of course,  any values which depend upon these numbers (such
       as True  Airspeed which  depends upon  Density Altitude, which in
       turn depends  upon Pressure  Altitude and  Standard  Temperature)
       will also  be only  approximations.   And since some of the vari-
       ables used  to compute  the values in these derived equations are
       themselves computed using derived equations, the inaccuracies may
       very well  compound each  other.  What does this all mean?  IF IT
       IS CRITICAL,  CHECK IT  USING A METHOD OF KNOWN ACCURACY.  If you
       don't, you will be courting disaster.
