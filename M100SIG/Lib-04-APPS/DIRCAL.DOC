This is a text file continuing the description of DIR3.ba on this DL.
The program takes input from the operator in the form:

698000
for E1
3964000
for N1

698500
for E2
3964500
for N2

It subtracts E1 from E2 to obtain X and N1 from N2 to obtain
Y. Then computes the angle in Radians using ATN(Y/X). Then it converts the Radians to Degrees by multiplying the radians by 180 and dividing by PI (3.141592654). Then it converts the Degrees to MILS by dividing by .05625. It checks to insure the direction is in the right quadrant.
The program uses the pythagorim theorim to convert the two sets of coordinates to a distance ('sqr(((e1-e2)^2)+((N1-N2)^2)))
I use this program in the military to obtain orienting data (Range and Azimuth) for my Counterfire Radar.)
