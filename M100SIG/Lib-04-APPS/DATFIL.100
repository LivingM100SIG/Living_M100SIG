DATFIL.100 is a data organizer/filer program with user defined prompts and
display parameters.

Data files are initialized with the built-in TEXT program, and the data you
wish to organize is entered and displayed by using the DATFIL program.

Data file organization
----------------------
Before initializing the data file you should organize the file structure and
display layout.  Data files are organized into groups of records, and
records are organized into groups of fields.  You should determine:

a) the number of fields for the data file record.
b) the name (prompt) for each field.
c) the "location" on the LCD where each field prompt will appear.

The "location" is the print position that would be used by BASIC's PRINT@
function, and is calculated as follows:

 R = row (or line)
 C = column
 LOCATION = 40*(R-1)+(C-1)

So if you want a prompt to appear on the third line (row), column 5, you would
calculate the location as follows:

    LOCATION = 40*(R-1)+(C-1)
             = 40*(3-1)+(5-1)
             = 40*(2)+(4)
             = 84

Data is entered and displayed immediately following the prompt, so
for a comfortable appearance you should add a space after the prompt.

Since lines are 40 characters, you can make one prompt appear directly under
the previous prompt by just adding 40 to the location.  Add 80 if you wish to
skip a line, etc.

Data file initialization
------------------------
Create a new TEXT file using the TEXT program.  On the first line enter the
number of fields (prompts) you need for this data file.  For EACH field, enter
a prompt <cr> and a location <cr>.  For example:

3
Name   :
44
Phone  :
84
Comment:
124

This example is for a file with 3 prompts (first line).  The first prompt
is the word "Name   :", and it will display at location 45.  Lines 4/5 and
lines 6/7 represent fields 2 and 3.  Be sure there are no extra CR's (blank
lines), but be sure there is a carraige return at the end of each line.

That's all you do manually, to set up a data file.  Some programs do this minor
chore for you, but to keep the program small enough to run in the ALTLCD
buffer, this task is done manually.


The Program
-----------
You must CLEAR 0,62480 to make room for DATFIL.CO.  When you run DATFIL the
following menu will appear:

DataFiler

        <A>dd
        <D>isplay
        <E>xit

        =>

Only an A, D, or E will have any affect.  All other responses are considered
invalid.

Press A to add data records to your new data file.  Press D to display records.
Press E to return to the 100 main menu or calling program.  The program 
accepts upper or lower case characters.

ADD data
--------
You will be prompted to enter the name of a previously created data file you
wish to use.  If the file does not exist, the program will beep and return
to the A/D/E menu.

Assuming you have entered the name of a data file created for this program,
DATFIL will read the "header" info (the number of prompts, field names, and
locations).  You will then be prompted to enter data by displaying the prompts
 you selected, and the program will accept your input.

After each record is entered, you will be prompted with "More?".  Press N for
no more!  You are in the ADD mode so the program assumes you wish to continue
to add data, and only a "N" will break out of the ADD mode and return to the
A/D/E menu.

If you feel that a mistake was made when entering data, you will be able to
correct that error with the TEXT program.

DISPLAY data
------------
You will be prompted to enter the name of the data file you wish to display.
If the file does not exist, the program will beep and return to the A/D/E menu.

Assuming you have entered the name of a data file created for this program,
DATFIL will read the "header" info (the number of prompts, field names, and
locations).  You will then be prompted to enter "String" data for selective
record display.

Press ENTER if you wish to display all records, or enter characters to be
matched.  Only records containing the match string will be displayed, if a
match string is specified.

Each record is displayed by printing the field prompt at its location, followed
by the data entry.

After each record is displayed, the cursor jumps to the upper left corner
of the LCD and waits for a keyboard input.  Any key will bring up the next
record except "N".  Press N for no more!  You are in the DISPLAY mode so the
program assumes you wish to continue to display data records, and only a "N"
will break out of the DISPLAY mode and return to the A/D/E menu.

A beep will sound when the last record of the file is displayed, and the next
keypress will return to the A/D/E menu.  If the last record doesn't match the
specified string, then a beep will sound with a blank screen when the file has
been completely searched.


ERRORS
------
The beep is the only indication of an error.  If it occurs during the ADDing
of data then it may indicate an out of memory condition and you should examine
the data file to see if the last entry is properly organized.  If only a
partial record is found, you should delete that last partial record, and
then see about making more room in RAM before continuing to ADD data records.

If the last record is not properly organized, DATFIL may display data
 which is past the "end of file" marker.  This is harmless to your programs or
data files and is easily corrected using TEXT to correct the last data record
in the file.  Use the N command to abort the display.

All other errors are trapped within the program and the operation is aborted.
This is usually a bad A/D/E command, or a file name error.


SUPPORT UTILITIES
-----------------
DATFIL data files are completely compatible with files created by
CRDFIL.BA, and there are many utilities in DL4 that will enhance the use of
DATFIL.  These utilities can be located with KEY = CRDFIL when scanning or
browsing DL4.


Enjoy the program....
