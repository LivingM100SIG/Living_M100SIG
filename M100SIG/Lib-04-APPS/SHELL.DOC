SHELL.BA  -- A template file for M100/M102 BASIC applications.
--------------------------------------------------------------

SHELL is a collection of housekeeping routines that may be used as a
template for writing application programs in BASIC. The routines
provided perform the following tasks:

Main function key menu support:
-------------------------------
Eight function key routines located at lines 1000-1999, 2000-2999, etc
provide function key callable application functions. Functiion key eight
is reserved as the normal exit to the system menu.

Function Key Primitives
-----------------------
Routines at lines 9100-9899 provide support for function key interrupts,
along with menu line control. Keys which are enabled display a prompt;
keys representing functions that are masked show a checkerboard pattern
over the prompt, and a function that is currently active shows its
prompt in reverse video. These routines allow for a great deal of flex-
ibility in creating function key submenus.

Program status display
----------------------
A stub for a status display is at lines 9000-9099.

Filename prompter
-----------------
A filename prompter is located at lines 10000-10099.

Numeric value prompter
----------------------
A numeric value prompter is located at lines 10100-10199.

Initial program screen
----------------------
Program introductory screen display is at 29000-29099.

Main function wait loop
-----------------------
A wait loop, pending a function key interrupt from the main menu, is
located at line 32000 and following. It is followed by the normal exit
from the application.

Please see programs TIMER.BA and FINCAL.BA for examples of application
programs based on SHELL.BA.
