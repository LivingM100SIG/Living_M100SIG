    DF-AUT provides three useful data management options for DATFIL and
CRDFIL data files and gives users who regularly prepare similar formatted
reports the ability to automate the process.  (If you like to create each
report individually then you may prefer DF-RPT in this same library.  You
might even find it handy to have both!)

    DF-AUT:
        1) permits you to completely sort an entire data file by any priority
           of data fields.
        2) will write formatted reports based on any data fields you
           require to either the screen, printer, disk-drive or RAM
        3) permits you to set conditions for each data field which must be
           met before the record is reported and can total data fields and
           report the result

    DF-AUT is easy to use and fully compatible with the 100/102/200.  Because
it uses Wilson Van Alst's ZIPSRT.CO sorting program, DF-AUT can process
data-cards of virtually any combined field length.  Please read ALL these
instructions before using DF-AUT.
    With your source file in RAM and DF-AUT and ZIPSRT on the menu you'll need
at least 3500 bytes PLUS the size of your data file as free RAM.  Using a Disk
based source file only requires 3500 bytes free plus the size of your data
file: clearly an advantage when dealing with LARGE data files.
    If writing reports to RAM then you'll also need RAM room for them.  Large
reports can be written directly to disk and printed later.

                - SET-UP -

     Download DF-AUT.DOC (this file) & DF-AUT.BA.  M100/102 users also
download ZIPSRT.100 from DL7.  T200 users will need ZIPSRT.200 from DL10. 
Remove any extra bytes and checksum the files as .DO files.  Make and save a
copy of DF-AUT.BA for backup.
     RUN ZIPSRT.100/200 as appropriate. They will create ZIPSRT.CO which must
be on the menu whenever you run DF-AUT.BA. Save a copy of ZIPSRT as backup.
     BEFORE you begin to run DF-AUT for the FIRST time you must set up
DF-FMT.DO as described in that section at the end of this file.  DF-FMT.DO
MUST be on the menu whenever you run DF-AUT.
     If you'll be working with Disk based data files you must also have your
disk loaded, the drive on and a DOS installed that is "ON" and which
recognizes "0:" commands.


            - OPERATION -

     DF-AUT expects you to use UPPER and lower case letters to EXACTLY match
Source and Format names.  At "Y/n" prompts either UPPER or lower case letters
are recognized and <ENTER> is considered to mean "no".
     When you run DF-AUT.BA you will first see a listing of all the source
files for which you have created print formats.  You have two options here.
       1) Type in the name of the source file and press <ENTER>.  (If there is
         only one format file for that source then DF-AUT will automatically
         run it.)
       2) Type in the name of a source file, a "/", and the name of a format
         file and it will run automatically. (E.g. "TRYOUT/LABEL".)
     If you did not specify a correct format name and there are more than one
format available in DF-FMT for that source then a format list will display
for the chosen source.  After you correctly enter the name of a format, its
paramaters will display as a reminder.  If Ok, press "y": any other key
redisplays the formats available for your chosen source.
     DF-AUT will show the record numbers as they are being prepared and call
ZIPSRT to do the sorting (if chosen). Be patient when running large files. 
Sorting is M/L fast but preparing a 5K data file may take 1-2 minutes.
     The report begins with a header line containing the prompts for your
report fields. Your report will be as wide as the longest entry in each field
plus two spaces and will list data horizontally.  The header will be followed
by an appropriate string of dashes.  If your format chose "LCD:" as the
report destination then your screen will clear and the report will display:
use "PAUSE" to stop scrolling if needed.  Otherwise the record # displays as
data is reported.
     When DF-AUT finishes writing the report it returns to the "Source" menu.
<ENTER> quits to the main menu or type a source name to prepare another
report.



        - Setting up "DF-FMT" -

     DF-AUT operates using small, 6-line "report formats" contained in a .DO
file which you must create called DF-FMT.  Go to TEXT and open DF-FMT.  Return
to this DOC and use F5 to "Copy" the 25 data lines below and "Paste" them into
DF-FMT.DO.  This will become the master file where you will store ALL your
report formats using DATFIL.CO.  It also includes two formats for use later.

         - Creating Report Formats -

     DF-AUT expects to find the information it needs to create formatted
reports in DF-FMT.  To create each report format you'll need to know some
information about your data file.  Most of this information can be found by
examining the prompt field data contained in the first lines of the
data/source file.

       1)   Determine the number of prompts.  This is the number in the first
          line of the source file and must never be exceeded when working
          with DF-FMT.
       2)   Make a list of the prompts in the order they appear and number
          them, first to last, making sure you have as many listed as the
          number in step 1.
       3)   Decide how you want this data sorted: Name, ZIP, balance etc.?
          Your records will be sorted by the "ASCII value" of each data field
          with the "smallest" values on top.
            Write down the prompt field numbers in your preferred sort order:
          4  1  2  5  7 etc.  Only list the most important fields. (Including
          the phone# field when sorting a gift list may not be necessary.)
       4)   Decide how you want the data reported: which fields and the order
          you want them displayed.  You may report ANY of your source file's
          data fields in ANY order regardless of your sorting sequence.
          (E.g. 23  1  4  5  9)
            You might also want to scan the source file for maximum data entry
          length because your report lists record data horizontally and will
          be as wide as the combined longest entries in each of the reported
          fields with two spaces between each field.
       5)   Decide what conditions you want to set for records to be reported.
          A record must meet ALL your conditions before any part of it is
          reported.
            DF-AUT uses five selection condition codes: ">", "=", "<", "+"
          and "$".  ( ">" means greater-than, "<" means less-than and "$"
          means a string. ) 
            Because DATFIL/CRDFIL record-fields can contain both numeric and
          alphabetic data you MUST know the nature of the data field before
          choosing a selection code.

            ">", "=", and "<" should only be used in NUMERIC fields because
          they define an arithmetic relation and letters always "equal" zero.
          Condition codes can only be used singly: if you need to report =>300
          then use >299.99.

            "+" tells DF-AUT to total all similar fields of any records that
          meet all other conditions and writes the total to the report.
          ("+" is used alone with the field number and requires no "value".)

            "$" reports a record only if the specified field contains an EXACT
          match of a text string and is best suited to alphabetic fields.
          You CAN use "$" in numeric fields: e.g. to select 5 digit ZIPCODEs
          from fields that also contain 10 character ZIP+4 data.


     When you've completed your preliminary outline, run DATFIL.CO using
DF-FMT as the data file. The prompts will be:

    "Frmt name: "
       Enter up to 8 characters as the name. (E.g. BAL>300 or ZIPLABEL.)

    "Srce file: "
       Enter the name of the source data file for this report using
       UPPER-CASE letters and no extension.  If the source file will be run
       from disk then include "0:" (E.g. 0:FAMILY )

    "Report to: "
       Specify the destination of your finished report using a MAXimum of six
       UPPER-CASE letters (plus prefix if disk): "LCD:", "LPT:", "BRTHDY",
       "0:BRTHDY".

    "Sort  /n/: "
       Enter the prompt field numbers in order of sort priority.  Begin the
       entry with a "/", type the field number, type another "/" etc.  The
       data MUST begin and end with a "/". (E.g. /2/3/1/4/ )  If you do NOT
       want the report sorted then type NONE or press <ENTER> at this prompt.

    "Rprt  /n/: "
       Enter the prompt field numbers to be reported: beginning, separating
       and ending with a "/".  

    "Sel /n?v/: "
       Enter selection conditions as follows: "/", field number, specifier,
       value (no entry if specifier is "+"), "/" etc.
       Example:  /3>1200/4$Y/5+/6=100/7+/  Type NONE or press <ENTER> at this
       prompt if you do not want to set conditions for this report format.


     If you want to create another report format file respond "y" to DATFIL's
"More?" prompt and begin again: otherwise press "n".  DF-FMT.DO now contains
your format file/s and is ready for further use.  You add NEW formats anytime
by simply re-running DATFIL.CO using DF-FMT and responding as above.
     The DF-FMT.DO you initially made includes two formats that let you keep
track of what is contained in DF-FMT.DO itself: "LIST" and "LIST-P".
Whenever you run DF-AUT you will see DF-FMT listed as a source file.  "LIST"
will display "Srce file:",  "Frmt name:", and "Report to:" on your screen.
"LIST-P" will report ALL the fields for each format to your printer.  (These
two formats also serve as examples of the way each format file appears.)
     If you later decide that a format no longer meets your needs you can
delete it from DF-FMT by using TEXT.  Find the SIX lines of code relative to
that format and carefully remove them using "Cut"/F6. (Remember that format
data will show the format name first, followed by the source file etc.)

                - ERRORS -

     The error trapping routines are only designed to catch problems with
files and formats.  Any other error will END and display the error code.  "No
printer" will display that condition and re-run DF-AUT.
     If you error out because of lack of RAM then go to the computer main
menu, kill SRT***.DO and SRT###.DO, if found, clear some more RAM and re-run
DF-AUT.

        ---------CREDITS-------

    Paul Globman suggested this automated reporting system based on many of
the routines in his commercial, 40,000 byte, CPM data base managment program
GLOBAL(c) and was very helpful in getting DF-AUT to run so smoothly.  Paul
Beta-tested all the routines and contributed many useful ideas about prompts
and displays.  Paul also wrote DATFIL.100/200 which breathes new life into the
"CRDFIL" tradition.
    Wilson Van Alst wrote ZIPSRT.100/200 which is twice as fast as other M/L
sorters and which allows DF-AUT to work with any length records.
