SYSOP Note: SURVEY.BA is 18,810 bytes as .DO file in TEXT and 15,194 BASIC with
first two lines removed. Conversion may be done on Model 100 with usual Load 
command OM, then List to find last line converted. Go to TEXT and CUT out the 
converted lines, return to Basic and use the MERGE command until OM then repeat
until mission accomplished. Managed to convert both ways with only 21K free 
memory.   .^Dave^.

	This is the documentation for the program "SURVEY.BA". The program 
should be run with "CAPS LOCK ON". The routines are menu driven so very little 
documentation is required.
	A knowledge of surveying calculation is, of course, a definite 
requirement.
	The program provides routines for azimuth/bearing traverse; field angle
traverse; inverse traverse; closure; balance by the compass rule; circular 
traverse; intersections for azimuth/azimuth,azimuth/distance,distance/
distance,and perpendicular from a point to a line; vertical curves; and 
horizontal curves.
	Options are given for a hard copy and for a fresh start. As long as 
"fresh start" is NOT selected the program continues to keep track of succesive 
points considering the traverse to be continuous. Throughout a continuous 
traverse all the various traverse routines may be selected for the particular 
information available. "Fresh Start" eliminates all totals and considers that a
new traverse is being started.
	I am sure that the program can stand improvement. Please direct all
