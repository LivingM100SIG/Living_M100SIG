Template to be used with MINIVC.WM3 to create a Personal Financial Statement.

I have used this for my own personal needs, therefore, some of the cells in
it are unique to my needs. However, it should serve as a guideline for you
to customize it for your own needs. Some of the formulas have been left as
"fill-in-the-blanks" structures, particularly those that have to do with both
current return on investments and current price ratios. The actual percentages
should be filled in for your own investments.

The section for other personal property is a section that I used to list,
generally, my household properties, computers, and other things of value that
I felt did not require specific lisiting. I gave the total of these assets a
lump sum value that reflected either their replacement value, their appraosed
value or their current dpreciated value. This value is the amount that I
entered under assets in the line "Other Personal Property".

Other assets are for listing items of property of sufficient value that they
represent a significant portion of your personal net worth. i.e. - Vested
interest in pension plans, Stock ownership in a business that you participate
in, etc.

The size of this template requires that you change several parameters in line
10 of the program. The line should read as follows:

10 MAXFILES=1:CLEAR8000:DEFINTA-Z:DEFSTRS:DIMI,J,C1,R1,C,R,F,P:CM=25:RM=25:SU="S":GOSUB7000:GOSUB5870:GOTO200

Additionally, when the program initializes and asks NW CM?, you must enter "I"
(no qoutes). To the query Precision: S or D:, you must answer D if any of your
personal financial data will exceed $999,999. It may even be necessary to use
double precision anyway due to intermediate calculations. I have not tested
this aspect of the template. I always use double precision. Formatting must be
to the default specs or 0 decimal places.

Lastly, the major fault with this template is its size. In some cases it may
need to be larger than I have made it, depending on the number and type of
assets that you have to list. However, even at its present size (9 columns by
72 rows), there are periodic delays for string garbage routines to work. They
are a maddening but necessary evil that I have tolerated in order to create
a workable Personal Financial Statement Template.

Any questions or suggestions for expansion (contraction) or improvements to
the template can be sent to me via Email or as amessage on the SIG.

Good luck. I was pleasantly surprised by the "Bottom Line" of my work with my
own personal information. I hope you will be also.
