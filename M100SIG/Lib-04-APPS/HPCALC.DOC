hpCALC is an easy-to-use RPN (reverse-polish-notation) emulator for Tandy 
model 100/102 laptops.  It operates identically with Hewlett-Packard 
calculators, but is not programmable.  This documentation assumes you are 
sufficiently familiar with HP calculators to be interested in this program, so
it concentrates on the unique aspects of hpCALC instead of teaching you RPN.

hpCALC's best feature is its simple user interface.  All options appear on the
screen, where they are easily accessed by a sliding-bar menu.  You don't need 
to memorize cryptic keyboard combinations, although several keyboard shortcuts
are provided.

Numeric entry can be from the embedded keypad or top row of keys.  Use an "E" 
or "e" to enter powers of ten.  Any calculation option shown to the left of 
the stack window can be selected by using the up and down cursor keys to slide
a highlighted bar to the desired row.  Hit the F1-F4 function keys to execute 
the calculation option when its row is selected.  The four math function keys 
(+-*/) below the stack window keep their functions regardless of the menu bar 
position.

Keyboard shortcuts;  "r"=roll down stack; "R"=roll up stack; "c"=clear x; 
"C"=clear registers; "D" or "d"=delete x; "s" or "S"=swap x&y; ESC=exit 
program.  You can execute all of these commands (except ESC) by sliding the 
menu bar and pressing the indicated function key.

Commands:  The "DEG" and "rad" function keys toggle capitalization on and off 
to indicate the current trig mode.  The "Pi" key returns that number up to 14 
digits.  The "fix" key takes the integer value of the current number in the x-
register and trims decimals to that number of displayed digits.  You can set 
from 0-14 digits, with a default of 5.  Attempting to use a number out of this
range will reset the digits back to 5.  The "p-r" and "r-p" are polar/
rectangular conversions:  put x in the x register and y in the y register, hit
"r-p", and the radius will be left in x with the angle (in deg or rad) left in
y.  "p-r" reverses the calculation.

Storage:  the "lstx" key will bring up the last x-register value which was 
entered or used in a calcualtion.  "sto" and "rcl" provide access to a single 
data storage register.

Calculation errors:  most errors are self-recovering.  If you try to divide by
zero for example, an "ERROR" message is briefly displayed in the x register, 
then x is redisplayed.
