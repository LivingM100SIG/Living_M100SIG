HOW DOES ALL THIS WORK? - read on!

First a note on MERGING

Although some of the above are stand alone programs most are files that
require merging into current programs to become operative.  Merging is done by
having the base program such as CRDFIL.BA loaded into basic in your
computer's RAM.  The text file to be merged should be in RAM and on the menu
(it could be merged from disk with POWR-DOS however).  Next type MERGE"file
name" and press <ENTER> where "file name" is the file to be merged such as
"CRDMCD.DO".  Your computer should flash wait as file is being merged.  When ok
is on screen merging is done and basic file can be renamed and merge or text
file killed.

NEXT EACH FILE WILL BE REVIEWED WITH DIRECTIONS

CRDMCD.ETJ

Suggested menu name is CRDMCD.DO
Suggested program name CRDMAC.BA

This file when merged with the basic CRDFIL.BA program provides the macro/
screen scrolling capability.  The program operates as you would expect the
original CRDFIL.BA program to operate (if unfamiliar with CRDFIL.BA see
CRDFIL.DOC for instructions) with the following additions.  For screen
scrolling in Display or Create mode use cursor keys.  A small arrow will appear
at each prompt as you scroll through the card.  Pressing <ENTER> acts as like
original program.  In add mode the cursor itself will move from prompt to
prompt when cursor keys are pressed.

In add mode pressing the <[> key at any prompt will move the screen to a macro
menu.  Here you will be asked for a macro number.  If a number is entered
the program will open the CRDMAC.DO file and look for an entry corresponding to
that number -  which if found will be entered as the response for the prompt
in which you first pressed <[>.  The CRDMAC.DO file is a separate file that
is in RAM and on the menu as CRDMAC.DO.  An example of its format is as follows:

Evan
Jones
POB 343
Annandale VA. 22003

In the above example macro or CRDMAC# 1 would be "Evan".  Number 2 "Jones" etc.
A list should probably be kept of CRDMAC numbers while entering data for easy
access.  Back to the CRDMAC menu. If at this point <H> is pushed the program
will list CRDMAC #'s with corresponding responses.  The whole list can be gone
through or press <S> to return.  At CRDMAC menu if <K> is pressed then a
review of special key/functions is provided.  If <R> is pressed then you
are returned to prompt.

After completion of a response it can be entered to the CRDMAC.DO list by
pushing F7.  This key also enters the response on card. It can then be called
as a response via a macro number.  If at a prompt a number is entered and the
<[> key pushed the program will look to the macro list for the response.  If a
prompt is completed from keyboard and <[> is pressed the response is entered as
if the <ENTER> key were pressed.

The <TAB> key provides for concatenation of responses.  If the cursor is moved
to the beginning of a response and <TAB> is pressed then the curser moves to the
end of the response and the response can be added too with macro or keyboard.
Concatenation remains in effect until enter is pressed.  The macro key <[>
considers as new any entry since <TAB> was pushed or last macro added.  The
<BKSP> acts as normal however if at the beginning of a response - if pushed it
will erase entire response.  This is a handy feature but when concatenating if
<BKSP> is pushed at beginning of next or concatenated entry entire response will
be erased - experiment with it.  Also if cursor key is pushed in mid entry
before <ENTER> key then response is erased.

 Please familiarize yourself with these features.  They are easy to use and its
tough to make a mistake that can't be easily corrected.  Happy CRDMacroing!

CRDRDB.ETJ

Suggested menu name CRDRDB.DO
Suggested program name CRDRDB.BA

This file is to be merged with CRDMAC.BA or with the original CRDFIL program
after original has been merged with previous file CRDMCD.ETJ

The resulting program after merging provides for a mini relational data file
capability which I call Data File Coordinator.  The program operates as
above with the additional feature of completing up to 20 responses by
matching both prompts and responses of up to nine entries (usually one is
sufficient).  This feature has many possibilities.  For example a customers
name, address, etc. could be completed from another data file simply by
entering a customer #.  Or you could have each card numbered (off screen
 -  remember you can have cards larger than LCD display) and match that number
to call up desired card info without ever displaying match number.  The entry
to this process is as follows: at prompt enter response in this format
!<file name>,<#>,<#>,/,<#>,<#>,<#>,<#> an example would look like this
!CUSTID,2,3,/,6,8,9,10 where "!" identifies entry as data file
coordinator. "CUSTID" is file name where data is stored (can be on disk using
POWR-DOS if preceeded by : ie :CUSTID). Numbers before the "/" are the #'s of
prompts and responses that must match exactly in both CUSTID and on current
card.  If they match then program matches prompts of numbers after "/" on
both CUSTID and current card. Again if matched then all responses for numbers
after "/" are completed in current card from CUSDID.  The order of numbers
doesn't matter.  The program will take up to nine #'s before the / and 20 #'s
after. The cursor will end up at last number. The above can be entered after
prompt or at CRDMAC menu.  Due to its length I don't recommend it be entered
at prompt as some of it may still be left on card after responses are
completed (the left over part displayed won't be stored however).  The best way
to use the above format is to have the data file coordinator format called from
the macro list. In other words if !CUSTID,1,/,3,4 is macro # 1 then at
response #3 on current card simply type 1 then push the macro key <[> and
responses for prompts 3 and 4 will be completed from CUSTID if all matches are
correct. This is where the program can have some real power - up to 20
responses can be completed with just 2 keystrokes and often the same data file
coordinator response is used on card after card. While program is looking for
matches the screen will display this "!!" flashing until responses are found

If the data file coordinator response is in this format !<file name> for example
as above "!CUSTID" then the program temporarily assigns CUSTID as the macro
file and goes to the macro menu.  At this point a number can be entered or
pushing <H> will review the file assigning CRDMAC or macro #'s. Following
this review the program returns to the current prompt or CRDMAC menu and if a
number is entered then for that entry the macro file is CUSTID.  After that
the program will automatically return to CRDMAC as the macro file unless !CUSTID
is called again.

Happy Data File Coordinating!

CRD2XB.ETJ

Suggested menu name is CRD2XB.DO
Suggested program name N/A

When merged to resultant program after above files have been merged this
addition provides M200 machines with cross bank input and output using
XBASIC.CO.  The file format is as follows Bx:<file name> or B3:CUSTID.  B
is a dummy charactor and could even be a space but must be there - x is the bank
where file is located - the colon is XBASIC format as required and the file
name is the file name.

CRDSRV.ETJ

Suggested menu name is CRDSRV.DO
Suggested program name N/A

This file when merged after any - all or any combination of above files have
been merged to CRDFIL provides an additional menu choice adding reverse
video.  Either responses or prompts or neither can be selected.  The only
caution is that this should be the last file merged out of the above files.


CDTMMC.ETJ

Suggested menu name is CDTMMC.DO
Suggested program name CRDTMP.BA

This file when merged with CRDFIL.TMP or CRDTMP.BA Tony's template program
allows templates of any size to be created (larger than LCD screen) Some
other additions to Tony's program are listed in beginning remarks of
CDTMMC.ETJ


CRDDFS.ETJ

Suggested menu name is CRDDFS.DO
Suggested program name CRDDFS.BA

See remark lines at beginning of file. Program loads lengthy files into RAM in
sections for easier manipulation. Program keeps track of which sections
have been loaded and continues loading sequentially when activated until entire
file has been loaded


CDMCD2.DO2

Suggested menu name is CDMCD2.DO
Suggested program name N/A

This is the second document file with related info on "*" files above and
other files as listed in CDMCD2.DO2
