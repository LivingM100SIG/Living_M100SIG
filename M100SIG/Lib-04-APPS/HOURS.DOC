---------

  I had a need for a program which would calculate the total hours between a
start and a stop time which occured on the same day.  I also wanted to be able
to total up a set of these times and have the answer expressed in either
hours/minutes or minutes/seconds.  HOURS was the result of that need.  The
program is short and simple, but I will explain it briefly below.

  When you first run HOURS, you will be presented with a menu like below:

(A) COMPUTE ELAPSED INTERVAL
(B) COMPUTE TOTAL TIME
(C) QUIT

  If you choose (A) or (B) you will then be shown the following menu:

(A) HOURS/MINUTES
(B) MINUTES/SECONDS

  Choose (A) if you want to work with normal clock times.  Choose (B) if you
want to do something like total all the times on each side of a phonograph
record before recording it to tape.

  If you chose (A) from the first menu you will then be prompted to input the
start hours,minutes (minutes,seconds) and the stop hours,minutes (minutes,
seconds).  Enter the times in  24 hour military format (i.e. 1830=6:30 PM).
Enter the time for the 1830 example as:

18,30

  You must place a comma between the hours,minutes (minutes,seconds) any
time they are entered in this program.  That is due to the input method I used
in the program.  You will then enter the stop time in the same manner.  The two
times MAY go past midnight but must NOT be farther apart than 24 hours.  This
does not affect the (B) choice on the main menu, as you could easily exceed
24 hours when adding together a large set of times.

  If you select (B) from the main menu, you will input your set of times, one
at a time until you are finished.  You must then enter 0,0 as the last time.
This signals the computer your inputs are finished.  You will then be shown
the total.

  Both the (A) and (B) choices offer you the opportunity to repeat that
particular calculation again.  If you select "N", you will be returned to the
main menu, where you may continue, or enter (C) to quit the program.

  Feel free to modify this program or embellish it to your heart's desire.
