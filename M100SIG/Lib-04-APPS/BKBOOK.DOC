               Blackbook allows you to print out a compact pocket sized 
          phone & address book from your ADRS.DO or other data file.  It 
          requires a printer with condensed (17 char per inch) print mode 
          capability to automatically produce a series to two-sided 
          page-numbered sheets (4 pages per sheet) formatted to be 
          assembled and stapled to form a convenient notebook. 

          Preparing your ADRS file: 

               Blackbook requires that the address file be prepared as 
          follows (which will not interfere with use of ADRSS or TELCOM): 

               Each entry which you would like to show up in the book must 
          start with a # sign.  This will enable you to eliminate 
          information which should not be printed (like you CIS 
          password!!!) or data that is not an address. 

          Each name and address should be in the following format: 

          # last name, first name \ street address \ city, state zip \ 
          telephone 

               Note that each field is separated by a backslash "[graph] 
          -".  If a field is empty, then place two backslashes together.  
          Any data beyond the 4 fields will be ignored.  Any fields longer 
          than 42 characters will be truncated in the printed listing (but 
          not in the data file). 

          Running Blackbook 

          Prompting is mostly self explanatory. 

               You are given opportunity to run a sort on your data file 
          if desired.  Blackbook has a built-in "quick and dirty" 
          alphabetizing feature which can be used to sort your file.  
          Since it writes the sorted data to a second file, the original 
          file format is not lost. The sort routine is provided mainly as 
          a convenience feature, faster and more sophisticated sorts are 
          available on CIS. 

               Once the file has been loaded and paginated, you are taken 
          through the printer set up menu.  The first sheet through the 
          printer is used as a setup and a hashmark is printed.  Measure 
          this position and confirm it is exactly in the center of the 
          paper, if not adjust the paper guides and try again.  The 
          program continues to provide hashmarks until you specify that it 
          is ready. 

               When prompted, line the paper up carefully at the top of 
          the page (you will need to duplicate the accuracy of this 
          alignment after flipping the paper over later) and strike a key. 










          You are given the option of stopping after every page to re-set 
          your alignment in case you are using single sheets or your 
          printer is not fully consistent in vertical travel. 

               Once all the fronts of the pages have been printed, it is 
          time to flip the paper.  When prompted, remove the paper from 
          the printer and flip it LEFT to RIGHT (not up and down) and 
          re-insert it without disturbing the paper guide, carefully 
          lining it up to the top line as before.  Then hit a key and 
          (hopefully) everything should line up. 

               Finally cut out the pages, fold and staple them down the 
          center.  Test out the book by immediately calling all your 
          friends! 

          Final notes: 

               The subroutine at 700 sets values that you can change to 
          customize the program to your equipment if required.  Also, 
          comments have be used heavily throughout to make it easy to 
          understand and modify the code.  These can be deleted to save 
          space. 

               Not all printers have exactly the same pitch in condensed 
          (I have seen 17 and 16.7 char/inch).  The CL (characters/line) 
          value in the 700 subroutine should be set according to your 
          printer. 

               If your printer does not seem to provide the proper 
          condensed type, check the printer manual for the correct codes.  
          Also check that the DIP switches are set correctly to permit 
          condensed typefaces. 

               Note: because the sort routine uses BASIC's line input 
          statement, it cannot properly read records longer than 255 
          characters in length (which are not normally encountered in ADRS 
          file).  If it encounters such a record it beeps and warns you 
          during the sort so you can be aware that the sorted file may 
          have some inaccuacies, however the original file is NOT affected 
          and normally the printed address book output generated from the 
          sorted file is not affected either.
