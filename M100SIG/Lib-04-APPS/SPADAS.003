FUNCTION KEYS
File Management/Caption Checklist

NAME [F1]:Presents the user with a list
of files and asks for a file name.
Entering a single alpha character will
open that file (name the report) and
proceed to the module menu screen.
NOTE: You can also enter an alpha
character directly,instead of
depressing [1] and accomplish the same
result.

TEXT [F2]:Presents the user again with
a list of files. In the upper left
corner is a prompt which asks "File to
edit?" and the command line tells the
user what to do. Type the name of the
file (without the .DO extension) that
you wish to edit and press <ENTER>.
This action will exit the program and
go to the top of the file you entered.

COPY [F3]:Presents a list of files and
prompts the user for a file to copy
FROM.  A file MUST be present from
which to copy.  Once selected, the user
is prompted for the file to copy TO.
If not present, the file will be
created.  If the file is present, the
file will be appended to.

SEND [F4]:Presents a list of files and
prompts the user for a file to send.  A
single alpha character entry selects
the file, which will then be "sent" out
the RS-232C port of the computer.
Parameters: 87E1D

FREE [F5]:Presents the user with a list
of files. The command line says (Erase
A-Z). Entering a single alpha
character will ERASE (or "KILL") the
file from memory. If a diagram is
associated with the report (denoted
with an asterisk after the letter,
i.e., A*.DO), BOTH files will be
deleted with a single keystroke.  If
you need to delete either one of the
two related files (NOT BOTH), you must
go into BASIC and type the command KILL
"filename.ext".

DRAW [F6]:this operation allows the
user to print a diagram.  The DIAGRAM
files are indicated by an asterisk
after the alpha character.  A single
alpha keystroke will select the "car"
file and initiate the drawing of the
diagram.

LIST [F7]:presents a list of files and
prompts the user for a file to print.
A single alpha character entry selects
the file, which will be sent to a
printer connected to the PRINTER port.
The output is formatted for a better
printed result.  The headings and
prompts are printed in boldface type
and the leading line numbers are
omitted.

NOTE: The LIST function currently
supports a printer in IBM mode set to
10 CPI in non-proportional print.  Any
problems with the output of the LIST
function may be caused by improper
switch settings or printer
incompatibility.  A common error can be
easily corrected by simply restarting
the printer.  Until a problem can be
corrected, the file can be printed from
the document itself.  The DIAGRAM
portion of the report cannot be printed
from the document and requires the
specific printing routine generated by
the program.

QUIT [F8]:this function appears when
Name, Text, Copy, Send, Free, Draw or
List are selected.  Pressing this key
allows the user to cancel the selected
function and return to the previous
menu.

EXIT [F8]:Main menu.
--------------------------------------
FUNCTION KEYS/module screen:

[1] File:accepts the entire screen and
writes it to the file.

[2] Back - returns to the previous
screen without writing the current
screen to the file.

[7] Skip - goes to the next screen in
the module without writing the current
screen to the file.

[8] Quit - return to program menu.

EDIT COMMANDS
From within a module screen:

TAB key -  Depressing this key advances
to the next field and enters a
default answer obtained from AGENCY.DO,
if any.If there is no default answer,
underscores are re-displayed.

DOWN ARROW - has the same effect as the
TAB key except that it will not advance
past the last field as will the TAB
key.

UP ARROW - backs up to the previous
field.

Shift UP ARROW - backs up to the first
field from any field on the screen.

Shift DOWN ARROW - advances to the last
field from any field.

Shift LEFT ARROW - same as Back

Shift RIGHT ARROW - same as Skip

CTRL LEFT ARROW - goes to the first
screen in a module without writing the
current screen to the file.

CTRL RIGHT ARROW - goes to the last
screen in a module without writing the
current screen to the file.

GRPH <0...9> - depressing the GRPH key
followed by a number results in going
directly to the screen of that number
within the module (if it exists).  For
example, depressing GRPH <4> will
go to the fourth screen in a module
if that screen exists. This is useful
in returning to a specific screen
within a module when a previous
report writing session had been
interrupted.

ENTER - accepts an entry.

DEL - fills the field length with
underscores.
