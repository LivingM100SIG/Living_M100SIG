            FLTCMP.BA was  written using  admittedly inaccurate  assump-
       tions, as  discussed below.   I  make no  warranties of any kind,
       including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a partic-
       ular purpose.  This program was written for my own entertainment.
       Since I  cannot prevent  its change by some unknown person before
       it gets  to you,  since I know that it relies upon approximations
       which are not totally accurate, and since, in fact, I cannot even
       be sure  that garbage  won't sneak in from the phone lines as you
       download it,  I cannot know if it will work for you, but would be
       willing to bet that it won't.

            FLTCMP.BA (checksum  1222469) was  written for the TRS Model
       100 to  take the  place of the slide rule type flight "computer".
       I wanted  it do  everything the  slide rule  can do,  plus a  few
       things a  slide rule  can't, like weight & balance.  I ran out of
       steam before  I wrote the code to do time and distance to a radio
       station.   You are welcome to modify FLTCMP to add this function,
       which is listed in the menus.

            FLTCMP pretty  much runs itself.  You move through the menus
       using the  up and  down arrow  keys.  The data for ident to ident
       navigation should  be stored in NAVAID.DO, an example of which is
       included at  the end  of this documentation.  The data fields are
       Ident,  Description,  Latitude  North,  Longitude  West,  Compass
       Variation.  Latitude and longitude data are included in NAVAID.DO
       as decimal numbers, but the number to the right of the decimal is
       not fractional  degrees, but  rather  the  minutes  of  latitude.
       Thus, 35  deg. 30 min. latitude would be included in NAVAID.DO as
       "35.30", and  not as  "35.50".   Compass variation,  on the other
       hand, is  in degrees  and fractional  degrees.   Thus, 10 deg. 45
       min. east  variation would  be stored  as "-10.75",  and  not  as
       "-10.45", if you want to get that exact with the variations.  The
       program will  append new idents to your NAVAID.DO, so you can add
       idents that  way.  I have found it convenient to put the lat. and
       long. for  enroute checkpoints and other locations for which I do
       not have  an ident  into NAVAID.DO using an ident of XXXX.  Note,
       however, that  XXXX is  the only  ident that the program does not
       expect to  be unique.   For  that reason, for VORs which have the
       same ident  as an  airport, but which are not located at the same
       lat. and  long., I  add "V"  at the  end of  the ident (e.g., LAX
       would be  the airport,  and LAXV  would be the VOR).  The program
       does not  require you  to use  "V", and  you can develop your own
       method of dealing with similar idents.  Use the up and down arrow
       keys to scan through your NAVAID.DO idents.

            The program  is huge  (necessary for all the screen printing
       and menus),  and therefore  is not  something you  would want  to
       leave stored  in RAM  on a  permanent basis.   Also,  you  should
       probably download  it into  something besides  an M100,  and then
       transfer it  to your  M100.   I have not really tried to optimize
       the code  to reduce  its size, although I do run a packed version






       which  I   have  packed   with  TOOLKT.BA  from  the  M100SIG  on
       Compuserve.   Actually, I have modified TOOLKT to run on my Tandy
       1000, and  have compiled  it, so  that it runs a lot faster and I
       don't have any memory problems.  It also makes it much easier for
       me to  store the program in ASCII on a floppy, and download it to
       the M100  when I  want to use it.  Being able to run the checksum
       on both  machines makes it easier to tell if I have gotten a good
       ASCII download  to the M100.  And being able to renumber and pack
       M100 programs  on a  PC clone  with much  higher speed  and  much
       larger memory  is convenient.   I  recommend TOOLKT.BA for anyone
       who has not downloaded it.

            If you  like this  program, or have suggestions on modifying
       it, let  me know  by leaving  me a message in either the AVSIG or
       the M100SIG  on Compuserve.   My  Compuserve ID is 73337,2600.  I
       may or  may not  acknowledge your message, as I get on Compuserve
       irregularly.  And, I may or may not make modifications based upon
       suggestions I  receive.   And, if  I do make the modifications, I
       may or  may not  upload the  modified version.   In  fact, if you
       think of  good modifications,  please make  them and upload a new
       version of  this.   To make  this  easier,  the  version  I  have
       uploaded is not packed.  Suggestions for improvement:

       1.   Code actual formulas for pressure and density altitude,
            instead of approximations derived from charts.

       2.   Combine the  navigation and  wind triangle functions to
            give a screen more like the standard Pilot's Navigation
            Log/Flight Plan form.

       3.   Rewrite the  weight and balance portion to use data for
            the plane  you fly,  or even  several planes from which
            you choose, stored in a .DO file, rather than having to
            be keyed in each time.

       4.   Rewrite the  entire program  to make  the various func-
            tions separate  program  modules  called  from  a  menu
            program.   You could  then load  a particular module or
            not, depending  upon whether  you will  use  it  for  a
            particular flight.   Sometimes  you don't  really  need
            density  altitude,  sometimes  you  don't  really  need
            weight and balance, and you may not want the calculator
            function at all.

       5.   Modify the  navigation module  so that  it averages the
            compass variations  for the  origin  and  destinations,
            rather than  using the  origin variation for the entire
            leg.

            As regards  modifications, the  only thing  I can  guarantee
       from this end is that if you manage to find out my telephone num-
       ber, I WILL NOT provide "support" for this program.  What you see
       is what you get.







            The formulas  for the  following quantities  were derived as
       linear  algebraic  (and  not  differential)  equations  from  the
       answers to  problems in  either the Private Pilot Test or the E6B
       instruction manual.   For  that reason,  the answers this program
       gives for  many of  these values  are only approximate.  At least
       some of these values are not linear.  For example, pressure alti-
       tude does not decrease at exactly 1000' (or even 910') per 1" Hg.
       The decrease changes as the pressure changes, and as a result the
       difference between  the correction factors for 28.0" Hg and 29.0"
       Hg is  greater than the difference between the correction factors
       for 30.0"  Hg and  31.0" Hg.  Note lines 103 - 108 of the program
       give six  different formulas  for calculating the correction fac-
       tor, depending upon the altimeter setting.

            The formulas  I have  derived are  those for  the  following
       unknowns:

       1.   Pressure Altitude-see  lines 103-108.   PA = Altitude +
            ((29.92 -  Altimeter Setting)  x 910)  + 46.8  + (60  x
            (28.5 -  Altimeter Setting))  if Altimeter  Setting  is
            less than 28.5.

       2.   Density Altitude-see  line 114.    Density  Altitude  =
            (Pressure Altitude  x 0.9075)  + (66 x Outside Tempera-
            ture - Standard Temperature)) + 256

       3.   Standard Temperature - see line 114.  Standard Tempera-
            ture = 59 - ((Pressure Altitude x 3.5)/1000).

       If someone  has more  accurate formulas for these values, I would
       appreciate getting  them.   Please leave them in a message to me,
       along with where you got them.

            Of course,  any values which depend upon these numbers (such
       as True  Airspeed which  depends upon  Density Altitude, which in
       turn depends  upon Pressure  Altitude and  Standard  Temperature)
       will also  be only  approximations.   And since some of the vari-
       ables used  to compute  the values in these derived equations are
       themselves computed using derived equations, the inaccuracies may
       very well  compound each  other.  What does this all mean?  IF IT
       IS CRITICAL,  CHECK IT  USING A METHOD OF KNOWN ACCURACY.  If you
       don't, you will be courting disaster.

            This program  uses code  adapted from NAV Ver. 4.4, by Lance
       Quinn, which  is available  from the  M100SIG  on  Compuserve  as
       NAV100.V44.   It  also  uses  code  adapted  from  FCALC.LAP  and
       FPLAN.LAP,  both  of  which  are  available  from  the  AVSIG  on
       COMPUSERVE.
