       The Daily Organizer is designed to keep track of four activities.

                         1.  Appointments
                         2.  Phone Calls
                         3.  Things To Do
                         4.  Expenses To Date

      The program consists of three menus.

        1.  The ACTIVITIES TODAY menu. 
        2.  The ADD menu.
        3.  The FIND menu.

      GETTING STARTED:The program requires six (6) directory slots on the
      Model 100 menu for the program to run.  When run, the basic program,
      DAILYO.BA (slot 1), will create four (4) .do files for the program to
      access for information. The sixth slot (6) will be used to change, 
      delete or sort as required. Also, two (2) history files will be created
      at your discretion.

      The program will display:  <FL error> if no room on Model 100
      directory.






                                  - 2 -

       "DAILYO.BA" and press <ENTER> to display the ACTIVITIES

    COMMENTS FROM AUTHOR:  I developed this program because of my own need
    for a daytymer and my love for the Model 100.  The program has forced
    me to be more organized in my daily affairs. To be used properly, one
    has to update activities daily.  I hope that you will get the same
    enjoyment from this program that I do.  IT'S MORE FUN ELECTRONICALLY!
