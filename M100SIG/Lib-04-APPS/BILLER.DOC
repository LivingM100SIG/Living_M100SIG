   BILLS.100  EASY TIMEKEEPING$$$

 Bills.100 is a time/billing system for the model 100,  which takes advantage
of the internal clock.  The program keeps track of time in minutes,  rounding
up in cases of fractions. 
 You use function keys 1-4 and follow the prompts,  that's all there is to it. 
Your answers to queries may be up to 256 characters long.  You must use caps 
consistently however.  If you enter a client name all in caps, or partly in 
caps,  you must capitalize the same letters when you search for information.
The instr$ function does not like upper/lower inconsistency.
        To use the program create a dummy file with TEXT called time.do.
Time.do should contain three words (any words will do) each on a separate line
followed by a carriage return,  and the word DONE (in caps) on the fourth line
followed by carriage return.
        Time do is the temporary holding file for an activity. The program also
creates a text file called Log.do and other text files that you name. 
        Run the program.  Hit F1 to log a new activity. You are asked for a 
client name and what you are doing. Don't use caps in the client name,  if 
you're likely to forget whether you did ot not. The client name and the
activity may each be up to 256 characters. But the shorter the better. That's
it,  the computer logs the date, name, activity and time to time.do and waits
till you tell it your done.
        Hit F2 to tell it you are done. Note that if you hit F1 without
clearing a previous entry, you will be asked for an end time before you are
allowed to start a new billable activity. F2 will then log the information
client, date, activity, and total time, to Log.do.
        Hit F3 to generate a quick screen report on a particular client. You
are asked for the client name (here's where caps consistency is important),
your HOURLY billing rate, and given the chance to scroll through everything
you've done. 
        Hit F4 to pull all the information about a given client which is stored
in Log.do , and send it to a file that YOU NAME. You are again prompted for 
client name and your hourly billing rate. All the information, dates, times,
activities, amounts due, total amount due, and selected billing rate is stored
in the new file. This file is for downloading to your office system or
printer.
        Hit anything else and you exit Biller.  Files created with F4 can be 
scanned with the text editor. At the bottom you will see the total amount due. 
        Biller is most useful if you dump the stored information every day,
or at the end of the week,  freeing up memory.  
        The model 100's clock runs when the machine is off,  so you need not 
leave the machine on after entering an activity with F1. The exact time is
logged to time.do.  The program is self loading on powerup as long as you name
it "biller.ba".  This is done with an IPL command.  (See your BASIC manual for 
details of this useful function.) Power up later to enter when done and the 
exact end time will be logged. 

        So, when you pick up the phone, go to a meeting, start intervewing a 
witness, hit F1 and turn the machine off. Don't forget to hit F2 when you're 
done.   The program is so simple many improvements can easily be made.  The 
trick is to keep the program size under control and respect the 100's miniscule
memory capacity. That's why many potential features haven't been added. [This
program was converted from its original M200 version, and was reformatted, 
crunched and slightly improved from the original.  Make your own improvements
if you like.]   Comments and abuse to David Huntington Williams,Compuserve
