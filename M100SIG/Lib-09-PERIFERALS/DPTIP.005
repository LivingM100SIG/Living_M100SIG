                                   DPTIP.005

   This tip is an addendum to DPTIP.004. You should, also, read .004 for the
basic information regarding the use of the patch.

   Thanks to Richard Eckerlin of Ultrasoft Innovations Inc. for the following.
This is a much shorter version of the program given in DPTIP.004. It
accomplishes the same thing without all the bells and whistles. It only has 192
bytes and its checksum is 12,498.

   To use DPISUP.BA, follow the same procedures outlined for the use of
PATCH.BA in DPTIP.004.

                                   DPISUP.BA

0 'SUPERA/DISK INSTALLER FOR 100
10 IFPEEK(35495)=233THENPOKE35495,82:POKE35496,139:PRINT"SUPERA uninstalled":END
20 IFPEEK(35495)=82THENPOKE35495,233:POKE35496,157:PRINT"SUPERA installed"

   Remember, as with PATCH.BA, DPISUP.BA <<must>> be loaded into RAM before
loading DPSUP.BA because of DiskPower's "bump-up" feature. And if you wish to
kill SUPERA, it <<must>> be turned off before running DPISUP.BA to restore the
original parameters in DiskPower. Then, after running to DPISUP.BA, you may
kill DPSUP.BA.
