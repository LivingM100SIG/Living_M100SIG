This is the first of a series of files which contain POWR-DISK.200, a DOS (Disk
Operating System) for the TDD-1 (100K version), and the Tandy 200 computer; and
the necessary documentation and instruction manual for the software.


POWR-DISK, and all it's related programs and files are copyrighted by Acroatix
Incorporated, and all the programs and files are so marked. They have released
this series of programs for public access exclusively on the CompuServe Model
100 Forum for the exclusive use of its members.  All other Rights are Reserved.


POWR-DISK is a transparent DOS that loads into high memory, and moves MAXRAM
down to protect itself from other machine language programs, and becomes trans-
parent to the user.  The basic "kernal" of the program, POWR-D.CO, provides
access to disk files from BASIC and TEXT, and via POWR-DISK routines, to other
machine language programs.

It is also relocatable to accomodate other machine language programs that may
cause machine language conflicts.

Five of the files contain hex datafiles which must be converted into standard
.CO files with the HXFER program (HXFER.200 in Library 10), or with a relocated
version (HXFER.REL).  See the instructions for HXFER use in the file HXFER.DOC.


All related files in the forum library may be listed with any form of the SCAN
or BROwse commands using "PDSK*" as the filename.  SCA PDSK*  or  BRO PDSK*.

Following is a list of the files available, listed in the order in which they
should be read and/or downloaded.


1.  PDSK01.200:  This file; describes POWR-DISK.200, the files that are part of
the system, and the release conditions by the copyright holder.

2.  PDSK02.200:  The complete manual for POWR-DISK.200.  The file contains
embedded Top-of-Form commands for proper paging, and should be echoed to a
printer to obtain a complete copy of the manual.  The file is 63K bytes, and
will print on approximately 28 pages.  Echoing to your printer at 300 baud
should take about 45 minutes.  If you have a desktop computer, or one with more
RAM space available, you can download the file for later reference or printing.

You can also read, echo or download the manual in seven segments of 11K or
less, so they will fit in RAM.  They can then be saved to an external device or
printed as part of a complete manual.  The segmented manual is contained in the
seven files PDSKM1.DOC to PDSKM7.DOC.  These files contain the same information
that is contained in PDSK02.200.

3.  PDSK03.200:  This file contains all you really need to get the basic POWR-
DISK operational in a Tandy 200.  It contains a hex datafile of the machine
language routines in POWR-D.CO, and a BASIC loader and start-up program called
START.BA.  Convert the hex datafile into a .CO file with HXFER, and run START
to load and execute POWR-DISK.


THE REST OF THE FILES LISTED BELOW ARE OPTIONAL, DEPENDING ON WHAT OPTIONS YOU
CHOOSE; RELOCATED VERSIONS, BASIC LOADERS, AND A MAP OF THE DOS ROUTINES.


4.  PDSK04.200:  This file contains an expanded version of START.BA, with all
the bells and whistles of the original version on the release disk.  It is not
necessary that you download or read this file if you elect to use the shortened
version in the PDSK03 file.

5.  PDSK05.200:  This file contains the hex datafile which is converted into
POWR-D.CO by HXFER.  It is the same version found in the PDSK03 file, and if
you elect to use the short method of getting started (in PDSK03), you will not
need to download or read this file.

6.  PDSK06.200:  This file contains the POWR-DISK menu program, MENU.BA, which
provides a menu access system to disk files.  It uses 3.5K of RAM, and is not
necessary to use the POWR-DISK system. Most of the functions of the program can
be duplicated from BASIC or TEXT with direct commands.

7.  PDSK07.200:  This file contains a program called FLOPPY.BA which will run
a copy of FLOPPY.CO directly from a pre-saved copy on disk.  It clears RAM
space, loads a relocated version of POWR-DISK, which can them be used to load
FLOPPY.CO into it's normal executing position.  The relocated code is stored in
the PDSK09 file.

8.  PDSK08.200:  This file contains MPLAN.BA which is not documented in the
POWR-DISK manual.  It's apparent purpose is to run a relocated version of POWR-
DISK which does not conflict with the Tandy 200's version of MSPLAN.  The relo-
cated code is stored in the PDSK10 file.

9.  PDSK09.200: This file contains a hex datafile which becomes PD-FLP.CO after
conversion by HXFER.  This file is a companion to PDSK07.

10. PDSK10.200: This file contains a hex datafile which becomes PD-MPL.CO after
conversion by HXFER.  This file is a companion to PDSK08.

11. PDSK11.200: This file contains a BASIC relocator program, which can create
a relocated version of POWR-DISK at any location in RAM.  The program name is
RELOC.BA.  It's two companion files are RELO.DO in PDSK12, and POWR.CO in
PDSK15.

12. PDSK12.200: This file contains a copy of RELO.DO, a file which is required
by the RELOC.BA relocating loader.

13. PDSK13.200: This file contains a copy of RESTOR.BA, a program which will
"Restore" a normal version of POWR-DISK after running a relocated version at
another address.

14. PDSK14.200: This file contains a map of the POWR-DISK routines which may be
"called" by other machine language programs, thus providing disk access from
those programs.

15. PDSK15.200: This file contains a hex datafile of POWR.CO, the relocatable
version of POWR-DISK.  After converting with HXFER, this file, along with
RELO.DO (PDSK12), is used by RELOC.BA (PDSK11) to create a relocated version at
any address you choose.


The complete version of POWR-DISK.200 is contained in these 22 files. For those
forum members who have Model 100's or 102's, we suggest they use the POWR-DOS
system, which is an upgraded version of POWR-DISK, with additional capabilities
and functions.  Those files, in Library 9 of this forum, can be located by
scanning for files with the keyword P-DOS.  The command SCA KEY=P-DOS will
provide a list of the relevant files.

On this forum, POWR-DISK is only available for the 200, while POWR-DOS is only
available for the 100/102.  While POWR-DOS is a superior version of POWR-DISK,
we were unable to obtain a copy from Acroatix Inc. to release into the public
domain.
