  CVTDIC.TD2 is a short program that aids in converting the two letter .CHP
dictionary files in the DL to the one letter dictionary files needed for the
.TD2 version dictionary programs.
	
  The disk which contains the two letter file (named DIC-AB.DO thru DIC-YZ.DO)
to be split into one letter files (named DICT-A.DO thru DICT-Z.DO) must be
ready in the drive before answering the first program prompt, which is letter
to be transferred. The letter to be transferred must be in upper-case and no
CR is necessary. All words in the appropriate two letter file starting
with the letter selected will be copied into the appropriate one letter file
in RAM, so it may be saved to the appropriate dictionary disk. When the
transfer is complete the program will return to the computer's main menu.
