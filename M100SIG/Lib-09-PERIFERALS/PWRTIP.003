PWRTIP.003/RECOVR.PWR
=====================

(Somehow I left this out of PWRTIP.001.)

M100/T102 owners with (TDD1) original 100K Tandy Portable Drives take note:

The Powr-DOS files include a very capable file recovery program.  This program,
alone, may justify collecting Powr-DOS *IF YOU OWN A MODEL 100 OR TANDY 102 AND
THE ORIGINAL TANDY PORTABLE DISK DRIVE*.  Unfortunately, this program will not
run in a Tandy 200 (there being evidently no examples of T200 Powr-DOS) and
will not work with the TDD2 drive (*much* to my dismay).  But if you've got the
proper equipment, you probably need this program.

Files to pick up (all DL9 except HXFER):
POWR-D.INF for installation instructions.
POWR.DOS
HXFER.100 [DL7] to load the P-DOS file.
PWR-09.DOC for RECOVR documentation
RECOVR.PWR
DOSTIP.010 for my patches to RECOVR

**Don't retrieve the others until you've read POWR-D.INF.**


This program's *extremely* valuable.  It's a bit clumsy to use--something my
patch file addresses, but doesn't totally repair--but is able to retrieve any
file which hasn't been damaged.  Since almost all diskette damage occurs to the
directory, this means you can usually recover every file from a damaged
diskette.

Usage hint:  The program's options permit look/sees as though the file was a
doc.  Almost all files have identification information near their begining. 
Check the file as a DOcument, first; then change to something else if that's
appropriate.

Well worth your CompuServe time.  Check it out....
