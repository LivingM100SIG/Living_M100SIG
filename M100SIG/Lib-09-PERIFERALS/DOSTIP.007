DOSTIP.007: Checking for Powr-DOS
=================================

Like most everyone else, I've been using LFILESV to check-see if Powr-DOS is
installed as well as for its intended use to reset the P-DOS RAM hooks.  It
came to me in a dream (well, in a sleepless night) that a better line
zero might start:

0 CLS:ONERRORGOTO10000:Z=DSKI$(""):LFILESV:etc....
10000 CLS:IFERR=5THEN?"No Powr-DOS":ENDELSERESUME

Near as I can tell this accomplishes the necessary task of checking for P-DOS
without risking a trashed RAM bank.  Those of us with multiple RAM banks,
at the least, would certainly appreciate it if folks would adopt this
convention.

My thanks to Don Zeikel for pointing out an error in the earlier version of
this file.
