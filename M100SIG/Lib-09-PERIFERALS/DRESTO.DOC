     DRESTO.TDD  is  a  program designed to automatically restore files and
     programs from the Tandy Disk Drive.  It  requires  Acroatix  POWR-DISK
     software.  

     The  program  first  prompts you for a directory file, which is a file
     containing a list of the files to be auto-loaded.  If you  saved  them
     using  DBAKUP.TDD, then this directory is ready to go.  You can create
     your own directory file by using text and typing in three header lines
     terminated by C/R, then all the files you  want  to  load  (C/R  after
     each) .

     If  you  answer  the  directory  prompt  with  only  a  C/R,  then  it
     automatically uses the file DIRi in a single bank system, or DIR1,2,3,
     or4 in a PCSG  system.   This  was  the  default  in  DBAKUP  for  the
     directory file.

     DRESTO  then begins to load the files in the list.  If it encounters a
     file to load that already exists in ram, it will ask to rename the ram
     file before loading the disk file of the same name.   If  you  respond
     with only a C/R then it over-writes the ram file.  If you respond with
     only  an "A", then it does not load the disk file at all.  If you type
     in a file name, it renames the ram file and then loads the disk  file.

     When  through  you  have  the  option to delete the ram version of the
     directory file used for loading.  

     Like DBAKUP, if the program terminates abnormally, then you must  edit
     line 4.  The first part must read A$=" 1 " in order for the program to
     run  from  the beginning again.  Otherwise, it continues from where it
     left off.

     If you have any questions, you can leave me a message, but I only  get
     on the SIG every 7-10 days, so don't expect a quick reply.

     Enjoy!
