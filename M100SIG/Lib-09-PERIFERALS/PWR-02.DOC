                                Loading POWR-DOS



          POWR-DOS gives you access to your portable disk drive (PDD)
          from your computer.  Yet, POWR-DOS comes on a disk, so the
          question arises: how can you load in POWR-DOS itself?  The
          answer is a special-purpose loader program which can access
          the PDD only to load POWR-DOS.  We provide two different
          loader programs; you choose one depending on your situation. 
          Both programs are written in BASIC.  Each has its own
          advantages and disadvantages:


             * PL.BA ("program loader") operates with the PDD DIP
               switches in their normal position.  Consequently, if you
               frequently re-load POWR-DOS, PL.BA is more convenient. 
               However, PL.BA is difficult to enter from the keyboard.


             * IPL.BA ("initial program loader") is compatible with the
               Tandy IPL.BA program (as listed in the Tandy instruction
               manual.)  You can key it in quickly; further, PCSG's
               Super ROM has IPL.BA built in.  However, each time you
               run IPL.BA, you must set the DIP switches differently
               from the running position, which can be annoying if done
               often.


          You may occasionally have use for both programs.  PL.BA is
          probably handier most of the time.

                                Basic Procedures

                            Choose the Loader Program

          If you are using another disk program already, such as
          Tandy's FLOPPY.CO or our POWR-DISK, load in PL.BA from your
          owners disk.  PL.BA operates correctly when all four DIP
          switches are off; since this is their normal operating
          position, you will probably not need to change them, but they
          are worth checking the first time.

          If you do not have access to your disk, then you must type in
          IPL.BA.  (Note: if you have Super ROM, you can use the
          built-in IPL.BA found in the ROM.)  To enter IPL.BA, get into
          BASIC and enter the following program:


          10 OPEN"COM:88N1DNN" FOR OUTPUT AS 1
          20 PRINT#1, "S10985157C00AD7EF08B3AS901FE"
          30 LOAD "COM:88N1ENN",R
          SAVE "IPL
          Menu


          If you make an error in a numbered line, re-type it.  Once
          you have returned to the menu, switch off the power on your
          PDD.  Turn it over, and locate the four DIP switches.  (See
          your PDD manual for more information.)  Move them all to the
          "on" position.  Then, switch the power back on and insert the
          POWR-DOS owner's disk.


                                 Choose POWR-DOS

          Once you have PL.BA or IPL.BA in place, run it from your
          computer's menu.  If you are using a disk package (such as
          POWR-DISK) that adds functions to BASIC, deactivate the disk
          program first.  Refer to the product's manual for details.
          When running the loader program, you will see the prompt:


          Powr-DOS or Tiny (p/t)?


          Answer with a "p" and press ENTER.  The loading procedure
          with commence.

                            Shift the BASIC Programs


          A question may appear:


          Is it safe to move PROGRM (y/n)?


          Instead of "PROGRM", the question will contain the name of a
          BASIC program.  If the  program name is SUPERA or PG Design's
          MENU program, see the section below about "immovable
          programs"; otherwise, answer this question with a "y".  (It
          is safe to move almost any BASIC program.)

          The following message should appear:


          POWR-DOS now active.
          Press space bar for Menu


          Press the space bar, and you will return to your computer's
          menu.  There should be about 3,000 fewer bytes free than
          before you started.  If you used IPL.BA (as opposed to
          PL.BA), you must return the DIP switches to their normal
          position: all off (Do this with PDD power off).  Then, you
          can move on to the next chapter, "POWR-DOS Basics".



                                Notes and Options


                               When to use IPL.BA

          Just about the only time you will want to use IPL.BA is after
          a "cold start", when all your files are gone.  In this case,
          IPL.BA is far easier to type in than PL.BA, which justifies
          flipping the DIP switches.  However, if you cold-start
          frequently, you may want to save PL.BA on cassette tape, or
          leave yourself an electronic letter (on a bulletin board
          service) containing PL.BA.  This way, you can use PL.BA,
          which is easier, with a minimum of trouble.

          Of course, whenever you remove POWR-DOS from RAM, you should
          load a copy of PL.BA first.  This way, re-loading it will be
          easy.
          Chapter 1               Loading POWR-DOS            Page 4


                                   Using TINY

          POWR-DOS takes up about 3,000 bytes; the loading process
          needs about 7,000 bytes to work successfully.  In
          anticipation of possible memory problems, we provide TINY, a
          program which gives you access to the PDD using 800 bytes of
          memory.  TINY has limited functions; you will probably want
          to use it only when you load and save files too large to fit
          into RAM with POWR-DOS.

          If you respond "t" to the question, "Powr-DOS or Tiny", you
          will load in TINY.  If you are using IPL.BA, the :low
          battery: light will flash irregularly after loading TINY; you
          must turn off the drive and re-set the DIP switches before
          proceeding. The TINY prompt appears as follows:


          > C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
          >


          The prompt is designed to remind you of TINY's functions. 
          "C" stands for a command (one of K, L, S, or Q) and the F's
          and X's help line up the files names.  All TINY commands
          consist of a single letter, which stands for one of four
          commands:


             * L for Loading from disk;

             * S for saving to disk;

             * K for Killing a disk file; and

             * Q for Quitting the program.


          All commands require a file name. (Even "Q" may not work
          unless you enter a file name.)  The file name must line up
          with the F's and X's on the prompt.  So, for instance, to
          save a file called MEMO.DO to the disk, enter the following
          command:


          > C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
          > S MEMO  .DO[ENTER]     <--- (You type this)
          Chapter 1               Loading POWR-DOS            Page 5


          Neither [L]oad nor [S]ave will overwrite an existing file. 
          If you try to overwrite a file either in RAM or on disk, you
          will get an "AE" (already exists) error.  If you are [S]aving
          to disk, use TINY to [K]ill the old disk file first , then
          try [S]aving it again.  If you are [L]oading a RAM file and
          you get an AE error, you must [Q]uit TINY, kill the RAM file,
          then run TINY again to [L]oad the file.


          As you can see, TINY is a "no-frills" program.  It does have
          one convenience, however; it remembers the last file name you
          typed.  This can come in handy when overwriting files.  For
          example, if you wanted to replace MEMO.DO on the disk, with
          the MEMO.DO in RAM, you could use the following command
          sequence:


          > C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
          > S MEMO  .DO[ENTER]     <--- (You type this)
          AE err
          > C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
          > K[ENTER]               <--- (You type this)
          > C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
          > S[ENTER]               <--- (You type this)


                         Specifying an Immovable Program

          POWR-DOS exist in memory as an invisible BASIC program file. 
          The way that your computer manages its memory, BASIC programs
          reside in the very bottom portion of RAM; POWR-DOS usually
          resides in the very first possible BASIC position.  There are
          many advantages to the method, but there are two significant
          disadvantages:


             * Software that loads BASIC programs from the "bottom up"
               will cause cold-starts.  WARNING: FLOPPY.CO is the only
               known program that does this!  After loading POWR-DOS,
               do NOT use FLOPPY to load BASIC programs! (All other
               FLOPPY functions will work fine.)

             * Other software that uses BASIC files to "hide"
               machine-language code cannot be moved and still run
               properly.  There are only two programs of concern here:
               SUPERA.BA and PG Design's bank transfer program.
          Chapter 1               Loading POWR-DOS            Page 6


          If you are using one of these immovable programs, its name
          will appear in the "is it save to move" question.  Answer
          "n", and the name of the next BASIC program may appear in
          another question.  Answer "y" when a movable program name
          appears.  POWR-DOS will still load properly.

          Once you've loaded POWR-DOS "above" an immovable program, you
          must adhere to an important restriction.  Do Not Kill The
          Immovable Program until you turn POWR-DOS off.  If you
          accidentally kill an immovable program, you will very
          possibly cause a cold-start, so be careful.  See the error
          section below for more details on what you should do if this
          happens


                               Errors and Recovery


                              Errors in PL and IPL

          Both PL.BA and IPL.BA are simple programs which contain very
          little error-trapping.  The only reliable error indication is
          ?OM, which means that you have insufficient memory to run the
          program.  If this happens while loading POWR-DOS, try loading
          TINY, then saving some files to the disk.  Kill the files you
          saved, then try again.  If even TINY will not load, you have
          very little memory left.  You must remove something to allow
          for at least 900 free bytes before TINY will load.

          If the load procedure fails, the most likely indication is
          that the computer and the drive will idle, i.e., do nothing. 
          When this happens, press SHIFT-BREAK.  If you get an OK (in
          BASIC), press [F8] (or type Menu[ENTER]) and go through the
          following checklist:


            1. Remove the disk and examine it.  Is it a POWR-DOS
               owner's diskette?

            2. Turn off the drive's power.  Examine the DIP switches on
               the bottom of the drive - are they correctly set?  They
               should be all ON for IPL.BA or all OFF for PL.BA.

            3. Check the disk-drive connection to the computer.

            4. If you are using IPL.BA, check the listing carefully for
               typos.
          Chapter 1               Loading POWR-DOS            Page 7


            5. Turn the drive back on and insert the disk.  (Turning
               the drive off, then back on resets some internal
               circuits in the drive and could make the difference all
               by itself.)

          Once you've gone through this checklist, try to re-run the
          program.


                                 Errors in TINY

          TINY gives disk error codes corresponding to the POWR-DOS
          codes.  See the listing at the back of the manual if you are
          getting errors in TINY.


                          Errors While Loading POWR-DOS

          THe loading procedure for POWR-DOS can result in three error
          messages:


          Not enough memory to IPL POWR-DOS

          or:

          Directory is Full

          or:

          POWR-DOS code already installed!
          MAXRAMC = 32777


          (Note: MAXRAMC may have a value other than 32777)


          If there is not enough memory, use TINY to save some files to
          disk, then kill them to clear out approximately 7,000 bytes. 
          If the directory is full, you must kill one file, no matter
          how small, before you can proceed.

          It is possible that POWR-DOS can be installed and not active. 
          There is one CALL statement in particular which will
          deactivate POWR-DOS without removing the invisible BASIC
          program; for the Model 100, it is CALL 32454, and for the
          Tandy 200, it is CALL 39703.  These calls sometimes get used
          by other software; an example is the bar-code reader
          software.  When POWR-DOS is disable, it will not function,
          but it will not load, either.
          Chapter 1               Loading POWR-DOS            Page 8


          If some POWR-DOS features do not work, yet the loader
          complains that POWR-DOS is already installed, get into BASIC
          and type LFILES V[ENTER].  If you get a version message, full
          functionality has been restored.  If you get an ?FC error,
          you must use the BASIC program shown below to remove
          POWR-DOS, then load it again.  Alternatively, enter the BASIC
          command CALL nnnnn, where nnnnn is the value of MAXRAMC
          printed by the loader.  In nearly every case, this CALL will
          restore full functionality; however, it is less reliable than
          the BASIC program below, so use it with care.

          If you answer "n" to the question, "is it safe to move....?"
          you must never kill the "immovable" file while POWR-DOS is
          active.  If you do, you are at great risk of a cold-start. 
          If you do this accidentally, you may not get a cold-start
          immediately; however, POWR-DOS will be effectively disabled,
          and any file-related command or any POWR-DOS command could
          potentially cold-start the system.  If you have your wits
          about you, get into BASIC and enter the following program:


          10 'Tandy 200 values
          20 IF PEEK (2)=152 THEN C=39703:A=63302:D=10904
          30 'Model 100 Values
          40 IF PEEK (2)=125 THEN C=32454:A=64659:D=8098
          50 CALL C
          60 FOR X=A TO A+7
          70 READ I:POKE X,I
          80 NEXT
          90 CALL D
          100 DATA 112,111,119,114,45,100,111,115

          After running this program, it is safe to re-load POWR-DOS.
