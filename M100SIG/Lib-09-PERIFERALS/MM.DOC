I developed this Memory Management utility for the Model 100 to help
me manage several banks of RAM, ROM and machine language programs
stored in PCSG RAM banks, and extRAM or XR4. Switching between so
many different applications is a surefire route to a cold start
unless you carefully deinitialize the current program before
starting up the next one. I created MM.BA to automate this process.
Besides ROM loading and unloading CALLs, I've added several general
housekeeping routines like the standard BASIC datefix one-liner and
simple interfaces for the PCSG RAM banks and extRAM/XR4. Altogether
the whole tuna weighs in at under 1700 pounds (excuse me, bytes).

There are two 'banks' of function keys. The first bank (which you
access by holding down the CODE key) is for killing ROMs, clear
MAXRAM etc. The second bank is for loading ROMs and programs, and
for switching between (PCSG) RAM banks. I put them in this order for
two main reasons. First, in order to avoid cold starts, you should
always un-install the current ROM or machine language program
_before_ installing a new one. Second, the way I've set up the
program, the PCSG RAM bank switching function performed in the
second bank can be accessed more quickly using re-programmed
function keys in BASIC.

Although the program as you have downloaded is configured for my
environment, altering specific function key assignments to suit your
operating environment should be relatively straightforward.

Bank 1's keys:

F1 kill CDOS (the Chipmunk's operating system)
F2 reset vectors and restore a critical segment of HIMEM to its
unaltered state by poking in the values that were originally there.
(This is an attempt to prevent cold starts)
F3 CLEAR256,MAXRAM
F4 Kill LUCID's second paste buffer
F5 Reset function keys for working in BASIC
F6 Kill Cleauseau/ROM2

Bank 2's keys are accessed by holding down the CODE key and pressing
a function key:

CODE+F1 Goto PCSG RAM bank #1
CODE+F2 Goto PCSG RAM bank #2
CODE+F3 Goto PCSG RAM bank #3
CODE+F4 Goto PCSG RAM bank #4
CODE+F5 Load XR4 RAM bank #1 and install a set of function keys
        to interface with it. I keep a bank of programs here.
CODE+F6 Load Cleauseau/ROM2 from XR4
CODE+F7 Load SuperRom from from XR4
CODE+F8 Load RAM+ from XR4

*****************************************

As mentioned above, the program also performs a few other
housekeeping chores on startup. It reports the number of bytes free
and the value of HIMEM, resets the year to 1993, as a patch for the
M100 date bug (you can change this in line 5 to suit the current
year). It resets the BASIC function keys to call portions of the
program code. This allows you to switch RAM banks from BASIC, print
CALL63012 to call a ROM, the extRAM, or XR4, load the complete
memory manager program or reset the function keys.

Finally two numbers appear, one on each side of the sixth line of
the screen. These numbers refer to the RAM/ROM banks which you are
currently using. Both numbers will appear as '-16' until you have
taken the steps described below.

The number on the right refers to the number of the current XR4
bank. The routine pokes the appropriate XR4 bank number after the
ADDRESS entry on the main menu. I chose that spot because some other
programs (e.g. TEXT+ and SUPERA alter the BASIC and TEXT entries.
The correct bank number will be POKEd into place the first time you
choose a new XR4 bank with a CODE+function key.

Since as far as I know, the PCSG RAM banks do not leave any
information in RAM identifying the current bank number, this number
must be set manually using the routine contained in BANKID.BA (also
available on this forum). BANKID.BA POKEs the bank number you select
into the Main Menu, as an extension to TELCOM.

My main menu looks like this when I've got it working and am running
SUPERA in PCSG bank #3 ... from XR4 RAM bank #1:

Again, there are probably things in here that you don't need as they
are written, but if you like the concept, it should be easy enough
to replace whatever you don't need with something you do.

Credits:

The function key bank idea came from an article by Mike Wilson
called "Multiple Self-Prompting Function Key Banks for the Model
100," which appeared in the May, 1988 issue of Portable 100
Magazine. I haven't seen many programs that have used the idea. Only
one, other than mine, in fact: X-Tel. By the way, you must name this
program 'MM.BA' unless you change all seven references to the
filename within the program code.

I got the utility for killing Lucid's second paste buffer somewhere
on Compuserve. Sorry, I don't remember exactly where or who wrote
it.

The routine for resetting vectors and restore the critical segment
of HIMEM to its unaltered state was supplied by Tony Anderson.

Here is a basic outline of the program code, which is reproduced in
lines 1-4 of the program. You can conserve memory by eliminating
these four lines.

Lines 5-15 set up the environment.
Lines 20-50 set up the function key banks.
Lines 50-95 are subroutines
Bank #1 features start at 110.
Bank#2 features start at 510
