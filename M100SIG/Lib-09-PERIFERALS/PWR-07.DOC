                                 Disk-Based TEXT


          D-Text.BA is a POWR-DOS application which simplifies
          manipulating DOcument files on diskette.  At the heart of
          D-TEXT is the familiar TEXT program.  To use D-TEXT, load and
          RUN D-TEXT.BA from diskette or RAM.  D-TEXT.BA is a companion
          program to DMENU and has similar menus.


                                Basic Procedures


                              Accessing Disk Files

          When you first run D-TEXT, it displays the names of all the
          DOcument files on disk. (Unlike DMENU, you cannot display RAM
          file names, and only DOcument files will ever be displayed). 
          The display looks similar to the DMENU display, with
          different function-key selections:

                    |                                        |
                    |                                        |

                     ----------------------------------------

          The function key selection do not change (as they do in
          DMENU).  The keys have the following functions:

              [F1]  Form.  This key sets the printout format use by
                    [F4].  You can add more formats with PRFORM.BA,
                    explained in the Notes and Options section below.

              [F2]  Load.  This key loads the selected DOcument file
                    into RAM and enters the TEXT program to modify it. 
                    Use this key only when you do not want to use
                    D-TEXT features to access the file.

              [F3]  Kill.  This key KILLs the selected DOcument file. 
                    Before it does, it asks you to confirm your
                    intentions with the "y" key, just as DMENU does.

              [F4]  Prnt.  This key prints the selected DOcument file. 
                    It uses the parameters set with the [F1] key.

              [F5]  Page.  ON the Model 100 (only) this key will page
                    between two screens of document files if there are
                    too many to fit on one screen.

              [F6]  Disk.  This key reprints the screen using the
                    DOcument files on the disk.  Use it when you insert
                    a new disk into the drive.

              [F8]  Menu.  This key will return you to DMENU, or if
                    DMENU.BA is not in RAM, you your computer's menu.


                                 Printing a File

          D-TEXT provides rudimentary text formatting for printing disk
          files.  You select a format for the file with the [F1] key,
          then press [F4].  You will see the prompt "Ready to print
          (y/n)?" on the message line; press "y" to start, or "n" to
          cancel.  If you press "y", D-TEXT will print the document,
          and depending on the format, it may repeat the "ready to
          print" message at the end of each page.


                              Editing a Small File

          You can easily edit any disk file small enough to fit into
          available RAM.  Simply select the file with the widebar
          cursor and press [ENTER].  You will see an intermediate
          screen that looks as follows:

                     ----------------------------------------

                    |Buffer:     0                           |

                     ----------------------------------------


          (We call this screen the "file summary" screen).  As long as
          the message "<ENTER> to Edit" appears, you can press [ENTER]
          again and edit the entire file.  D-TEXT will load the disk
          file into RAM automatically and jump to TEXT.  When you are
          finished with TEXT, press [F8].  You will see the message:


          Save Changes (y/n)?


          If you made changes to the file and want to save them, press
          "y", and the disk file will be updated.  If you press "n",
          D-TEXT will ignore any changes you made while in TEXT, and
          you will return immediately to its menu screen.


                            Appending to a Large File

          If a file is too large to fit into RAM, you will not be able
          to edit it all at once.  It is necessary to select a portion
          of it to edit.  If you select a file too large to fit into
          RAM, then press [ENTER], D-TEXT shows a screen similar to
          this:


                     ----------------------------------------
                    |File:    LFILES.DO                      |

                    |Buffer:     0                           |
                    |Total:  16231  vs. 11449 free in RAM    |
                    |----------------------------------------|
                    |<ENTER> to Append                       |

                    |     On   Top  End  Buff Files     Menu |
                     ----------------------------------------

          Note that the total bytes required exceed the bytes free.  In
          this case, D-TEXT defaults to an "append"; if you press
          [ENTER] again, you will go into TEXT with an empty file. 
          D-TEXT will append any material you enter into the empty file
          onto the end of the disk file you selected.  In this way, you
          can build a DOcument file up to 64K, which is the largest
          possible disk file.


                             Modifying a Large File

          When you wish to change a DOcument file too large to fit into
          RAM, you must select a piece of it small enough to fit into
          RAM.  We call this piece of the disk file the edit portion. 
          You have three choices of how to select the limits of the
          edit portion:


             * You can start the edit portion at the beginning of the
               disk file and stop it somewhere in the middle of the
               disk file;

             * You can both start and stop the edit portion somewhere
               inside the disk file; or

             * You can start the edit portion somewhere inside the file
               and stop it at the file's end.


          All three of these options are in addition to appending.  To
          select one of these options, select the disk file to edit on
          the D-TEXT menu, then press [ENTER].  When you see the file
          summary screen, use [F3] and [F4] to set the conditions for
          the Start and Stop points of the edit portion, respectively. 
          You will notice that the message will change to "<ENTER> to
          Set Limits" whenever either Stop or Start are "Set".

          If you choose to set limits, D-TEXT will give you a series of
          arbitrary limits inside the disk file.  For example, if you
          have selected "Set" for the start of the edit portion with
          [F3], the screen might look like this:
