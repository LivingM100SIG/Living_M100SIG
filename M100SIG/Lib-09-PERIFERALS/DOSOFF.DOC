DOSOFF is a utility for use with Supera version 2.0 and CDOS. It will turn off
CDOS while leaving Supera on. It is a more convenient way to exit CDOS than
using the F8 function key or the LFILESOFF command. The only effect that
DOSOFF will have on Supera is that it will turn off Continuous text.

   If Supera or CDOS is already off nothing will happen.
