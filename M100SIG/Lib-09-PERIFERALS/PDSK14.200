All addresses in Hexadecimal.

E650 - Start of Code.  JMP statements
       to supported calls.
E662 - Initialize Vector pointers.
       Uses a table at E68F.
E68F - Table in the format:
        byte - offset
        word - vector for F507H.
       The byte is offset from last
       latch minus one.
E6B4 - LFILES entry point
E6FE - Loop for file names
E73C - Determine free sectors
E768 - LFILES OFF
E771 - LFILES MENU
E775 - Restores User COM setting
       (jmp'd to by MAXRAM+12)
E79D - Sets up TDD into file-command
       mode.  Prelim. for all i/o
E7D6 - Sends 2 chars in H&L to TDD
E7EC - Sets COM to 98N1DNN.  Saves COM
       setting for LFILES MENU if
       different from 98N1DNN.
       NOTE:  This technique is not
       perfect, as users will discover.
E80C - '98N1DNN'
E813 - Sets up file-name command:
       On entry:
        A=Fname code 0, 1, or 2
       On exit:
        HL address to put file name
        (if any)
E82E - Set up command string for TDD
       ENTRY:  A=command
       EXIT: HL pts to arg. byte ct,
             initially set to 0.
E83F - Send previously set-up command
       (Calculates checksum, xmits)
E86E - Check for active COM port.  If
       data-set not ready, NR error.
E876 - DN error entry
E879 - CM error entry
E87C - AE error entry
E87E - Error handler for codes >58
       on entry, e=error code.
E8FB - Error-"message" table
E910 - Receive response from TDD
       (checks checksum)
E960 - JMP here if TDD indicates a
       DOS error occurred (IO, etc.)
E982 - Device ID expansion latch code
       identifies ':' and '0:'
       NOTE: ALSO RESETS EXP. LATCHES
       60H & 62H, DUE TO M200 ROM BUG
E9A3 - Allows '0:' (expansion latch)
E9AB - Exp. Latch for KILL.  Kills TDD
       files if ':' specified.
E9BE - Command dispatcher for single-
       code commands with no TDD
       response expected.
E9C8 - Check for DO file on disk.
       Name of file in FC93-FC99.  'DO'
       Is supplied.
E9CB - Same as F10F, except use
       extension named by H&L.
E9CE - Check for file on disk found
       in F746-F74E.
       On exit, Z set for new file,
        not set for existing file.
       File len. available for existing
       file at EE3E, in MSB/LSB order.
E9EA - Expansion latch for device-
       table router.
E9FF - Device table for TDD
       Same format as for ROM DVT's.
       EA09 - OPEN driver
       EA65 - CLOSE driver
       EA78 - OUTPUT driver
       EAA2 - INPUT driver
EAF1 - EOF function expansion
EB18 - LOADM expansion
EB1F - LOADM ,F code
EB92 - Reads DE bytes from opened TDD
       file into mem. at HL.  Code does
       not check for EOF; HT error
       will result if read is past end.
EBB1 - Set up buffer for read routine
       above.  File must be found with
       EC9E routine, then this routine
       must be called.  Then READ can
       access data.
EBC9 - Table of File-type data:
        Byte: directory status byte
        Word: POWR-DISK routine adr.
        Word: Adrs of pointer to start
       for CO, DO, and BA file types.
EC49 - LOADM/RUNM without ,F from TDD
EC81 - BASIC LOAD from TDD
ECC0 - SAVEM expansion latch
ECC5 - SAVEM without numbers (by file)
ED19 - WRITES DE bytes from HL to
       opened TDD file.
ED3A - SAVEM with numbers to TDD.
ED72 - BASIC SAVE to TDD.
EDAE - MAXRAM expansion
EDB5 - CLEAR expansion
