The M100 menu is a model of simplicity and congeniality. DVI users need miss it
no longer; MENUD emulates its functions--but for DVI files!

MENUD expects to find a text file called DIRECT on the disk, created by 
DIR.DVI, another program in this XA. It lists the files in DIRECT in a format 
similar to that of the M100 menu, except that .DO file names are in caps and 
.BA file names are in lower-case letters.  .CO file names appear in caps, 
followed by an asterisk.

Function keys permit you to move to the next menu page (if there are more than 
24 entries in DIRECT; MENUD will accommodate up to 72), SHOW a file's comment 
line, show the disk comment line, get the size of a file (correct to nearest 
number of sectors), find out how much ROOM remains on the disk (correct to 
nearest number of clusters [=9-sector groupings]), and return to the regular 
menu.

The FUNKEY line is overwritten with data, then restored, after a brief pause (
which may be modified by altering the loop in line 180).

Menu lovers--bon apetit!

P.S. Placing the cursor over a text file name causes it to be loaded into
RAM under the same name, after which the regular menu appears. If you place
the cursor over the name of a program and hit "ENTER," it will  RUN, but not
be stored under a name in RAM.

Enjoy!
