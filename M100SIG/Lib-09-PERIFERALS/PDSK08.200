This program, and it's companion ML program PD-MPL.CO (PDSK10.200) is not
documented in the manual and is unmentioned in subsequent newsletters.

Apparently it is designed to run a specially relocated version of POWR-DISK in
the 200 which does not conflict with access to, or use of the built-in MSPLAN
spreadsheet program.  Generally, MSPLAN creates pseudo-.CO files in RAM just
below the normal MAXRAM address, 61104.  When Power-Disk is loaded and active,
it moves the MAXRAM pointer to 58960, and MSPLAN assumes that it's normal work
area is being used for something else, and won't let you enter to develop
another spreadsheet.  Apparently, PD-MPL.CO loads at 57498, which is 1462 bytes
lower than the normal loading address.  This would leave a buffer between
POWR-DISK and real MAXRAM which might be usable by MSPLAN.

There is also a TIP file in Library 9 which describes how to remove MSPLAN from
the menu in any bank, thus eliminating the source of the problem.  Simply use
one bank exclusively for Power-Disk, and leave MSPLAN available in the other
two banks.  The problem was originally discovered with FLOPPY.CO, but since
Power-Disk presents the same problem, it is cured by the same solution. (See
TDDTIP.004)
