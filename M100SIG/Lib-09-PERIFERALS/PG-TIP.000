TIP FILE FOR PG RAM WITH OLD MENU.BA
------------------------------------
Phil Wheeler [71266,125] -- 9/13/86


The old (currently delivered) MENU.BA program for the PG RAM's
(all sizes) has some known problems.  A new program is scheduled
for delivery to purchasers of the 128K and 224K by the end of
September (1986!). It will be compatible with all but the original
32K board (maybe even with that - I haven't asked), and presumably
will be available as an upgrade to current owners of 32K and 64K
boards.

This file describes the problems I know of with the current
software, and how I avoid them -- and notes some of the promised
features of the new program.

1. Loading

The current Menu programs require that ALL Basic programs be
removed before it is loaded.  The 'UR-2' Ultimate ROM II menu
entry looks like a Basic program in this context.  Kill it, too!

The new program will have a single loader for all banks.  It will
ask how many total banks you have installed and which one you are
in.  It will shove itself into the bottom of RAM (without needing
your Basic programs removed) and make itself invisible so it
cannot be inadvertently killed.

2. NAME Bug

The current program does not trap lower case entries, nor does it
force the extension to be the same.  You can rename 'FILEN.BA' to
'filen.do' with DISASTEROUS results.  Avoid this by using CAPS
LOCK when renaming, and providing the extension.

The new program will force CAPS and retain the old extension.

3. Open File (aka Cold Start) Bug

The main cause of cold-starts with current PG RAM boards is
turning off the computer (or letting it power off on its own)
while in a bank other than Bank 1.  Due to a pointer problem,
several things can happen, most of them very bad, when you turn on
again -- in Bank 1.  I avoid this very successfully by: (1)
Setting POWER CONT in all but Bank 1; and (2) Always returning to
Bank 1 before turning off the computer.

If you do not follow this approach (or forget to), then when next
you do turn on, IMMEDIATELY cycle through all banks using the
designated F-keys.  This will reset the pointers and you will be
OK.

The new program fixes this problem, presumably in all its guises.
Peter (the 'PG' in PG Designs) gave it his personal attention.

4. Compatibility

I use many of the add-on products available for the Model 100,
including Super ROM, Ultimate ROM II, Powr-Disk, TS-DOS, Disk
Power 100, the TDD and the Chipmunk -- as well as much of the
software here on the SIG.  Here are some compatibility notes.

     o FLOPPY.CO (TDD file manager) is incompatible as it stands.
       A patch to fix it is given in the latest versions of the PG
       Designs manual.  See TDDTIP.006 (DL5) for this simple
       patch.

     o Disk Power 100, in its current version, is totally
       incompatible with the MENU.BA utility -- since they both
       require the same location in RAM to operate.  My favored
       solution is that Ultrasoft provide a version of DP100 which
       will relocate itself to just above other low-RAM resident
       programs (including SUPERA; see below).

     o SUPERA used to be incompatible.  Versions available  for
       about the past year are compatible, due to cooperation
       between Micro Demon (David Sumner) and PG Designs (Peter
       VanHeusden).

     o Super ROM appears to be totally compatible.

     o Ultimate ROM turns off the Menu utility; just type '0MENU'
       at the M100 main menu to get it back.  I use this combo all
       the time, and it is no problem.

     o TS-DOS and Powr-Disk appear to be totally compatible.

     o DSKPWR (DL5) has a slight incompatiblity, in that it does
       not overwrite the complete screen when run.  It requires
       you to hit F8 and rerun it -- or to turn off the Menu
       program before running -- and type '0MENU' at exit.  Again,
       no big thing.

     o I have not tried using the Chipmunk with the expansion RAM
       installed, although it is possible.  They have a physical
       conflict, in that the Chipmunk header board takes the same
       spot as the RAM board.  PG designs does sell an adapter
       which lets you use them together,but then the header board
       is not internal.  I have heard some reports of cold starts
       with this combination, but they could relate to the problem
       in Section 3.

5. Bank Switch Program

The old bank switch program for the 64K RAM will work with the new
units, if '>3' is replaced with '>N', where N = total banks.
