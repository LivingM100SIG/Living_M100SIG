     SARDINE TIP#1
     by Ronnie Riche
     [70337,3727]
     ===============

     This is a short tip file concerning the new Sardine ROM from Traveling
     Software and the use of the ROM with Powr-DOS and from Acroatix and
     DSKMGR.CO by J. K. Heilman.

     ---------------

     Sardine ROM is a new product by Traveling containing the powerful
     T-WORD word processing program combined with a ROM/disk based spell
     checker. The program is really terrific for the most part but there
     are two bugs in the ROM version that Traveling should have corrected
     shortly.

     - If you exit Sardine improperly, either from a reset or by timing the
       program out while in the editor, you will lock up when using the
       TERM option of TELCOM. Traveling has documented this bug and sent
       letters to owners of the ROM informing them of an updated version on
       the way to correct the problem.

     - The second bug is more of a problem. If you attempt to page plot a
       block merge you will get an 'Out of Memory' error and lock up.
       Sometimes reset will get you out; sometimes not.

       This bug has not been documented but I informed Traveling of it a
       short time ago and they were able to locate the problem. This bug
       will also be fixed in the revision.


     ====================
     Sardine and POWR-DOS
     ====================

     Sardine is designed to work in conjunction with the TS-DOS that is
     sold by Traveling. I use POWR-DOS and was pleasantly surprised to find
     that the text enhancements allowing reads and writes to disk work from
     Sardine when POWR-DOS is active. Since Sardine also has a feature that
     loads and runs any file named DOS100.CO from the disk you can easily
     recover from cold starts or optionally turn POWR-DOS on and off
     without ever resetting those lousy switches in the PDD.

     Just get DSKMGR.CO by J. K. Heilman from the SIG and name it DOS100.CO
     on your POWR-DOS boot disk. Keep a copy of PL.BA on this disk also.
     Using this disk with Sardine you can either do simple file transfers
     using DSKMGR.CO or enable the TEXT enhancements by booting POWR-DOS.

     To run DSKMGR.CO from the disk you simply insert the boot disk in the
     drive and press the 'DOS' key in the T-WORD menu. Since POWR-DOS
     resides as an unseen BASIC file (of a sort) there will never be any
     conflict between it and DSKMGR.CO even if you load both of them












     simultaneously. This allows you a lot of flexibility to choose the
     type of disk access that suits a particular task.

     To boot POWR-DOS without moving thos switches run DSKMGR.CO with the
     DOS key from the ROM, load PL.BA and run it. When asked if it is OK to
     move TWORD+ answer 'y' since this will install POWR-DOS more safely
     and will not affect the operation of Sardine.

     Naturally if you don't need the text/disk enhancement to Sardine
     DSKMGR.CO works fine as a file transfer program on its own and you can
     conserve RAM by leaving POWR-DOS off. If you are really short of
     memory space you could even put TINY.CO on your boot disk as
     DOS100.CO. This would allow you to load and save files with very
     little RAM overhead.
