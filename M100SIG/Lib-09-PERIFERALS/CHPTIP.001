PCSG's instructions on disk supplied with v3.24 are well written, but omit some
useful information.

When you invoke TELCOM.CO and turn its extensions ON, you can upload and
download using disk. That operation lowers HIMEM by 1149 bytes and reduces
available RAM by 1151 bytes. OK, that's acceptable. But when you turn the
extensions OFF, you don't recover those precious bytes.

A technique, based on a message from Neil Smith on the message board tells
how to get them back: in BASIC, type CLEAR256,MAXRAM. (Thank you, Neil).

Also, if you are not using disk and need all the RAM you can get, hit F8 and
answer "Y" to the prompt "REMOVE CDOS (Y/N)".  That will release another 4993
bytes.  You can reinstall CDOS by going into BASIC and typing CALL0, or by
pressing the reset button on the back of the M100.

Additional wisdom: if you invoke SPLIT.BA to break up a large disk file, you
will have plenty of time to brew yourself a cup of coffee.
