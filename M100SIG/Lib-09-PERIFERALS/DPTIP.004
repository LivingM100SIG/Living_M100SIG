   Thanks to Richard Eckerlin of Ultrasoft Innovations Inc., Montreal, Quebec,
Canada, here is the information about a patch for DiskPower which enables it to
run with SUPERA VERSION 3.0, by David P. Sumner. This information concerns the
100K version of the Tandy Disk Drive or the TDD1, and is the same for the 100
or 102. Apparently the 200k version, or TDD2 is able to handle the program with
no problem, although Richard Eckerlin states there will soon be a new version of SUPERA V 3.0 for the TDD2 which will make it a little easier for it to do
so.

   DiskPower loads each new BA program right above its own address in memory,
pushing each preceeding program one notch higher in the process. The
instructions with SUPERA VERSION 3.0, page 4, state:

     "Before loading SUPERA, you must first clear out all BASIC programs
   from memory. So save all BASIC programs to tape or diskette, and
   reload them back in after you have successfully loaded SUPERA."

   However, because of the above mentioned characteristic of DiskPower, this
results in a cold start. The problem lies in the fact that SUPERA VERSION 3.0,
looks to the Model 100 like a BASIC program. But it is, in reality, a machine
language program. Changing its location after loading is what causes the cold
start.

   I will give you four pokes. The first two tell DiskPower to load any
subsequent BA program above SUPERA's resident address. If the user later wishes
to kill SUPERA and use that memory space, the third and fourth pokes change
everything back. At the end of this tip is a short program I have written which
does this for me and reminds me of what I need to do. There are no restrictions
to the use of this information or the program except that proper credit should
be given if posted elsewhere or given to anyone.

      Here are the pokes:

      After loading SUPERA Version 3.0---
      Enter BASIC and type:
            Poke 35495,233 <ENTER>
            Poke 35496,157 <ENTER>

      After turning SUPERA off--
      Enter BASIC and type:
            Poke 35495,82  <ENTER>
            Poke 35496,139 <ENTER>

   I have tried this patch under varying conditions, loading, unloading,
killing programs, etc., with no problems. After turning off SUPERA, I entered
the second set of pokes and then killed SUPERA. My former status and memory
were returned.

   To use Patch, separate it from this information into a DO file of its own.
Enter BASIC and type LOAD"Patch (or whatever name you have given it). Then type
SAVE"Patch (or whatever). Save the BA program to disk or cassette. Before
loading SUPERA, follow the instructions on page 4 of SUPERA's booklet with one
exception, do not kill "Patch." Then load SUPERA. Run "Patch" and follow the
prompts. "Patch" MUST be in RAM before loading SUPERA. If you decide later to
kill SUPERA, first turn it off. Then run "Patch." Then kill SUPERA.

   The following program contains 1,866 bytes. Its checksum is 121,053. Before
loading as a BASIC program you will need to go through it and edit out all the
unecessary <CR>'s which are the result of uploading this in document form,
rather than in program format.
