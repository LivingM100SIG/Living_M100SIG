The IPL program for the TDD2 is as follows:

10 RUN "COM:98N1ENN"


The easy way to load FLOPPY from the TDD-2 is as follows:

1.  Turn the disk drive off and insert the utility disk.

2.  Go into BASIC and type  RUN"COM:98N1ENN" and press the ENTER key.

3.  Turn on the disk drive.

FLOPPY should load - it takes a minute or so.  If it does not, if the low
battery light on the drive starts to blink, turn off the disk drive and check
the utiltiy disk.  The write protect window in the upper corner should be open.
Reinsert the disk, and try again, starting from step 1.
