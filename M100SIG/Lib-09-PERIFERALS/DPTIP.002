DPTIP.002:

Using DP100 BASIC to create files up to 64K length.

In BASIC,files may be created up to 64K in length.  However, the disk drive has
an  idiosyncrasy  in that if you exceed the  maximum  file  length  by even one
single  byte,  the  drive will not save the file.  To overcome this difficulty,
we suggest one possible solution:

When performing disk output operations, instead of:

    OPEN "0:data.do" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
use
    OPEN "0:data.do" FOR APPEND AS #1

When  a  file  is opened for append and the maximum file size is exceeded,  the
previous  file  data remains intact and only the appended data is lost.

In fact, you may periodically close and re-open a file  for  append.  This will
ensure that only a small amount of data is  lost  when  maximum  file  size  is
exceeded.

Finally,   if you monitor the file data output  from  within the BASIC program,
you can avoid this problem completely.

Note  that  during   normal  DISK POWER operations  there  is  no such problem,
since files do not exceed 32K.
