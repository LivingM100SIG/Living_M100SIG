A SHORT MENU PROGRAM FOR POWER-DISK & POWER-DOS USERS

===============================================================================

The program was created to save RAM space on my M-100.  It is a very simple
MENU program which may be changed to suit your needs, but as it stands, it
will do EVERYTHING you need that PD is capable of doing  by using the function
keys to select your task.
You will have to enter the FULL NAME and EXTENSION of the file you are working
with, but this is a small inconvience.
