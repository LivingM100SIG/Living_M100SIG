POWR-DISK Owner's Manual
								Newsletter
								----------

Acroatix Inc., produced at least one POWR-DISK Newsletter, which was mailed to
registered owners of the POWR-DISK software.  The newsletter was dated May 15,
1986, and consisted of two 8.5 x 11 sheets, printed on both sides.  Much of the
material discussed various software upgrades that were available to owners of
TMPC, and other Acroatix software.  Information of use to owners of POWR-DISK
has been extracted and reproduced in this file. - ed.


MENU.BA Upgrade for the Tandy 200

The Tandy 200 version of MENU.BA is undergoing some significant changes as we
publish this newsletter.  All copies of POWR-DISK sent out after July 1st will
have the changed incorporated.  If you are a Tandy 200 customer and want to
update your copy of MENU.BA, we plan to have the new copy available as of July
1.  (Upgrade policy explained)

[We have no indication whether the version of MENU.BA released to the forum is
the early or the upgraded version.  Since Acroatix is no longer supporting the
product, there is no way to obtain an upgraded copy. - ed.]


Mysterious QFWFQ.DO File

When you attempt to view the TDD directory and there is no disk in the drive,
or the drive isn't connected, or there are other errors, you will find an empty
file in RAM named QFWFQ.DO.  You can delete this file without problems.  It is
a residual file created by MENU.BA.  If you do not delete it, MENU.BA will, the
next time you successfully use [F1] to view the TDD contents.


Error #55

If you get this error while running MENU.BA, it is almost certainly because you
are using Super ROM. Most likely to happen with the Model 100.


Error #51

If you get this error, change line 1 of MENU.BA to read:

	1 MAXFILES=1 : CLEAR 1000 : GOTO 24

Tandy 200 owners should change GOTO 24 to GOTO 25.


Error #9

This problem should occur only with the 200 version.  If it does, send your
diskette in for an upgrade.  [Leave message on forum message board, and we'll
try to figure it out. - ed.]
