These are some of my observations about the TDD2.
  I was interested in the new drive because my Model 100 is constantly on the 
road, and I really only have room for 10 disk in my briefcase.  Unfortunately I
have over 30 disks, and Murphy's Law states that you'll always leave the disk 
you need at home.  Another compelling reason was that Splchk's dictionary was 
taking up two disk plus another one for the programs SPLCHK.BA, LOOKUP.BA and 
DCPREP.BA.
 The first thing I did after getting the drive was to boot it using the new IPL
program.  I am thrilled, no more DIP switches, but you must run IPL with the 
disk in the drive, write protected and the drive off.  The DOS will not load 
with another program in Himem or with ROM+ installed.  AFTER typing RUN you 
turn the drive on.
 A few seconds later you are returned to the main menu and a new file called 
FLOPPY is present and Maxram is lowered to 60000.  FLOPPY is a 43 byte M/L 
program loader, it checks to make sure the DOS is installed and then EXEC's it.
  The DOS is a very crude form of DSKMGR.  One thing I like about it was it 
showed if the disk batterys were low.  However you don't see the RAM files 
until you press SAVE, but you do see the disk files when you press LOAD.  
Although you can load from a disk formated on the TDD1 it can't write to one, 
no matter what DOS you may be using.  To Maintain some compatibility with other
M/L programs I went into basic and saved the program by typing:
SAVEM "FLOPY2.CO",60000,62959,60000
 I then saved it two my "DOS" disk in Bank 0.  If you use FREMEM.BA to remove 
the hidden M/L program and loader, you can use FLOPY2.CO in the normal M/L 
conflict modes.
 To make a backup with the new TDD2 a BASIC program is supplied on the Utility 
Disk, BACKUP.BA.  Unfortunately it will not make a backup from a TDD1 disk to a
TDD2 disk.  I cleaned out one of my Power-DOS banks (I have 128K) and loaded 
COPY.BA.  COPY.BA will work fine as is, as long as there are no files on the 
destination disk.  The TDD2 can not use any of the sector-access modes of Powr-
DOS (DSKO$, CALL MAXRAMC+24 and CALL MAXRAMC+27.) So I changed Line 9 to:
 9 ONERRORGOTO26:LFILES FORMAT

This fix will allow you to format a disk for the TDD2 and copy from a TDD1 
disk.  The problem is that there is still 100K in Bank#2 to fill.
 There seems be be no problem using the old TDD1 DOS's as long as you don't 
have more then 40 files.  Since I consider DMENU.BA to be rather slow, I once 
again switched banks to one holding DSKMGR.CO.  I then manually copied the 
second dictionary disk to the new dictionary disk.  I still had some room left 
and added SPLCHK.BA and LOOKUP.BA.  As for DCPREP.BA I made a version I called 
PREP.CO that is stored right under Maxram (62138,62959,62138), and saved that 
to the last free sector on the disk.  Maybe it's just my copy of DCPREP.BA but 
I think Line 900 of the program should read:
900 DATA821,46

My copy read: '900 DATA812,46' and that can cause a cold cold start, as it 
would poke into memory above MAXRAM.

  SPLCHK.BA seems to work just fine, I would change Line #2 to:
2 MAXFILES=3:DIMF(25):DN=1:ONERRORGOTO22:FORN=0TO25:F(N)=DN:NEXT

  This stops it from searching for all the dictionary files, since they are all
on the same disk.  Saves quite about two minutes, and you don't have to babysit
the program.

  Booting Powr-DOS?  I have not been able to get Powr-DOS to boot off of the 
TDD2.  I have tried both the new and old IPL.BA and also PL.BA.  No luck.  What
I have done is using CHANGE.BA I changed 'powr-d.os' to 'POWDOS.BA' and used F7
to make it visible.  Then I pressed the label key and and found it located at 
32769, I then went into basic and typed:
PRINT MAXRAMC
  Which gave me 32775 (the exec address.)  I then Saved 'POWDOS.BA' on my Powr-
DOS Disk.  And wrote the following program and saved it as POWIPL.BA:

10 FORI=63932TO64130STEP11:IFPEEK(I-2)<>128THEN30
20 A$="POWDOSBA":FORX=1TO8:IFPEEK(I+X)=ASC(MID$(A$,X,1))THENNEXTX:GOTO50
30 NEXTI
40 BEEP:PRINT"POWDOS.BA not found":END
50 P=PEEK(I)*256+PEEK(I-1):IFP=32769THENA$="powr-dos":GOTO70
60 BEEP:PRINT"POWDOS.BA Located at"P"not at 32769":END
70 FORX=1TO8:POKE(I+X),ASC(MID$(A$,X,1)):NEXTX:POKEI-2,136:CALL32775:MENU

  Now if I need to install Powr-DOS, I IPL FLOPY2 and load POWIPL.BA and 
POWDOS.BA.  It is very important to load POWDOS.BA last with Floppy!!!  (If you
are using another DOS, kill all BASIC files and load POWDOS.BA first, then 
POWIPL.BA).
  Running POWIPL.BA will change the name back to 'powr-d.os' and make it 
invisible and then call the M/L program.  If you keep a program under Powr-DOS 
or if you have a Model 200 you'll have to come up with your own numbers.
  The first thing you should do after installing Powr-DOS is to load FREMEM.BA 
with Powr-DOS and kill off FLOPPY. This is because FLOPPY will load a BASIC 
program under Powr-DOS, therefore moving it and causeing a cold start.
