                               Formats and Backups


          The two primary headaches of dealing with any disk-storage
          system are formatting and backing up.  This chapter presents
          three application programs for dealing with these headaches.


                                Basic Procedures


                                   Formatting

          A new disk straight from the box cannot be used at all until
          certain timing marks and divisions are put onto it.  This
          process is called formatting.  Before you format a diskette,
          any attempt to read it or write to it will result in an ?IO
          error.

          Formatting with POWR-DOS is simple.  All it takes is a single
          BASIC command:


          LFILES FORMAT[ENTER]     <--- (You type this)


          Once a diskette has been formatted, it can be read or written
          to using POWR-DOS.  After formatting, you have an "empty"
          disk, which will show no files on it and 79 sectors free.

          The best way to format is to have a "formatting party" as
          soon as you buy a new box of diskettes.  This habit minimizes
          the risk of formatting an old diskette.  Once the drive
          begins to format, it is too late to stop it.  The very first
          part of the disk to be formatted is the "directory", where
          the names and locations of all the other files are stored. 
          Further, the drive cannot be stopped once the format begins
          unless you actually turn off its power.  If you realize two
          seconds too late that you are re-formatting a disk containing
          valuable data, your only hope is to turn off the drive, hit
          BREAK, and refer to Chapter 6.

                                     Backups

          A backup is nothing more than a copy of a diskette onto
          another diskette,  Backups are a nuisance.  They take time
          and effort, and they require you to use more diskettes (or
          cassettes).  However, backups of any important data are
          essential.  If you accidentally spill coffee on a first-draft
          report (written on paper), the paper is stained, but it is
          still readable.  If you spill coffee on a diskette containing
          your only draft, the entire contents of the diskette are
          lost.  If there is no backup, many hours of your work can be
          lost.  The drive itself can destroy diskettes if it is not in
          good mechanical repair (see Chapter 6 for more details). 
          Losing the only copy of valuable data feels rather like
          stepping on your pet hamster.

          Some computers boast two separate drives.  This hardware
          arrangement is ideal for copying, since the computer can move
          the disk contents in pieces.  However, the PDD is arranged so
          that no such convenience is possible; there can be only one
          PDD connected to your computer at once.  There are two
          alternatives:


             * Back diskettes up to cassette.  This procedure is
               relatively slow and unreliable (because of the
               cassette).  Just how unreliable it is depends on the
               luck you have had with tapes.  However, it has the
               advantage of being able to occur unattended by you. 
               Once you begin a backup to cassette, you can leave your
               computer and do something else.

             * Swap diskettes in the drive.  Using this technique, you
               load as much of the source diskette (the one you are
               backing up) into computer memory as possible, then put
               in the destination diskette and copy the memory contents
               into it.  Since the computer's memory is not usually
               enough to hold the entire diskette's contents, you may
               have to perform several swaps before completing the
               backup.

                               Copying to Cassette

          POWR-DOS comes with a program called COPY-C.BA to move the
          contents of a diskette to cassette.  To use it, load in
          COPY-C from a disk and run it.  It will present the following
          screen:



                     ----------------------------------------
                    |   Disk-to Cassette Backup              |
                    |                                        |
                    |         1.  Create Tape from Diskette  |
                    |         2.  Verify Tape                |
                    |         3.  Create disk from cassette  |
                    |         4.  MENU                       |
                    |                                        |
                    |   Press Key...                         |
                     ----------------------------------------


          The first step in a backup is to create a tape, so press the
          "1" key.  (NOTE: not [F1], but the numeral 1).  The following
          exchange will take place:


          Insert diskette to copy...press key
          Backup will take 10.85 minutes
          Proceed (y/n)? y[ENTER]
          Set up tape to record...press key
          Skipping Leader


          (Note:Each time the "press key" message appears, the program
          stops and waits for you to press a key on the keyboard). 
          Notice the time estimate.  COPY-C will copy only the sectors
          of the diskette that are being used, so that an empty
          diskette will take very little time to copy, and a full
          diskette will take about 28 minutes.  The program gives you a
          chance to change your mind once you see how long it will
          take.  Notice also that the program automatically skips the
          tape leader when recording, so you can start the tape at the
          very beginning.

          COPY-C proceeds by copying the diskette sectors "in use" to
          tape, one sector per tape file.  It prints a message such
          as, "Create sector 0 (1 or 31)" for each sector it is making,
          so you always know how far to go.  Once the tape has been
          recorded, you return to the initial screen.

          Once you have created a tape, you will probably want to
          verify it.  Once your tapes have verified OK consistently,
          you could probably skip this step.  Until then, verify
          everything.  What good is an unreadable backup?

          When you press "2" from the COPY-C menu, the following
          exchange takes place:


          Insert diskette and tape to be
          verified...press key
          Set up tape to play back...
          press key
          Loading directory (Sector 0)
          Disk verification will take 10.85 minutes


          After this, the sectors will verify one by one.  If there are
          no problems, COPY-C will return to its main menu when
          verification is complete.

          When it is time to restore a diskette from tape, press "3" on
          the COPY-C menu.  The following prompts appear:


          Insert a blank formatted diskette
          FORMAT.BA works best...press key
          Set up tape to play back...press key
          Loading directory (Sector 0)
          Disk creation will take 10.85 minutes


          For best results, you should use a diskette newly formatted
          using FORMAT.BA (see the section on FORMAT.BA below for more
          details).

                               Copying to Diskette

          Another POWR-DOS application program, COPY, allows you to
          backup diskettes to other diskettes.  Diskette backups are
          faster and more reliable, but you menus swap the source and
          destination diskettes, perhaps several times.

          Before running COPY, it is best to empty your memory of all
          unnecessary programs.  COPY uses your free memory as a
          temporary holding area for disk files, so the more free
          memory there is, the fewer swaps that you must make.

          When you run COPY, it first asks you to insert a destination
          diskette.  COPY needs a blank, formatted diskette to begin
          with; it looks at your proposed destination diskette and does
          one of the following:


             * If the diskette is already formatted and blank, it
               automatically proceeds to the next step.

             * If the diskette needs to be formatted, it will print a
               message, "diskette unreadable format (y/n)?"  You can
               then decide to format the diskette or abort the copy.

             * If the diskette already contains readable files, it will
               print a message, "diskette contains 15 files. Delete
               them (y/n)?"  You can then decide whether to delete the
               existing files or abort the copy.


          Once the destination diskette is formatted and blank, COPY
          prompts you to insert the source diskette.  It reads the
          directory and tells you how many swaps will be needed to copy
          all the files.  (Each time you remove the source diskette and
          insert the destination diskette is one "swap").  Then, it
          begins a list of files that it is copying.

          At this point, all you need to do is to put in the
          destination and source diskettes as prompted by the program. 
          Eventually, COPY will print, "Done", and return to your
          computer's menu.

                                Notes and Options


                                 Using FORMAT.BA

          In addition to the LFILES FORMAT command, you can use the
          utility FORMAT.BA to format diskettes.  There are three
          reasons why you might want to:


             * FORMAT.BA will warn you before re-formatting a diskette
               that contains files.

             * You can optionally omit the "check" during format, which
               speed up the format by about 45%

             * FORMAT.BA produces diskettes which accept sector writes
               almost 20 times faster than LFILES FORMAT.  This
               increase will only matter for specialized sector-based
               programs like COPY-C.  Writing to the disk with any of
               the file-based commands will nullify this advantage,
               however.

          FORMAT.BA is simple to use.  When you run it, it first asks
          if you want a "check" during format.  Answer "n" unless you
          have been having problems with diskettes going "bad".  After
          that, simply insert the diskette to format; if there are
          files, FORMAT will ask you if you want them deleted.  If you
          answer "y", then formatting will begin.

          Formatting is a convenient way to completely remove all
          files from a diskette.  Also, if a diskette has been
          "trashed", and gives only ?IO errors when you use it,
          formatting will often make the diskette usable again,
          although all data will be permanently lost.  If you have a
          "trashed" diskette containing valuable files, try using
          RECOVR.BA (see Chapter 6) before re-formatting.

                               Errors and Recovery


                                Formatting Errors

          There are two possible errors from LFILES FORMAT or
          FORMAT.BA:


             * You might get a "?WP Error" message.  This message means
               that the write-protect tab on the diskette is open. 
               Remove the diskette, close the tab, and try again.

             * You might get an "?IO Error" message.  Whenever you get
               this message during formatting, you should discard the
               diskette or return it for a refund.  If a diskette
               cannot be formatted, you cannot use it.  Before
               discarding it, you might try to format it once more, or
               use a bulk eraser on the disk and try again.



                              Errors while Copying

          Both COPY and COPY-C will abort with a simple message if
          there are errors.  The only possible errors arise from
          problems with reading or writing to the diskettes or tape.
