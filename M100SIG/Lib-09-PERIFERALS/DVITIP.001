SCREEN FORMATTING and PRINT@ on the D/VI

"SCREEN 1" switches the display to the CRT (or "SCREEN1,1" if the label line
display is desired- I prefer this).

"SCREEN0,1" is best to move to the LCD again (the date does not revert and
if this move is forgotton, date must be reset again while in CRT mode.

Recommend stacking:

"SCREEN1,1:WIDTH80" to switch to CRT

"SCREEN0,1:WIDTH40:MENU" prior to end of program run as system must be in 40
col. & MENU mode before turning the power off.


The PRINT@ command does work differently when in CRT mode- I'm not sure I
completely understand this but here goes: when using PRINT@, Disk Basic
recognizes the numeric expression of the first parameter in this command as an
ESC code, line # & column # according to whether 40 or 80 cols. is set.

Example: PRINT@75;"ABC" will be written by disk basic as

PRINT+ESC+"Y"+line#0, column #75+"ABC"

In 40 col. mode the A (first character in the string) is displayed on the last
column in the first line, instead of the 75th column from the "home" position,
where it should appear if in 80 col. mode. (In 40 col. mode the "BC" should
appear in the 1st & 2nd cols. of the 2nd line.) So, in your docs. you need to
clarify for the user whether they must be using an 80 col. monitor, because if
they have their DVI hooked up to the TV or are using the LCD with their DVI,
any PRINT@ commands programmed for an 80 col. format will not display
correctly.

Now, if all this sounds like gobbledygook to you, please check it out with
Woods Martin! Good luck. Also, you might want to take a look at VT100.DVI in
DL1 as an example.

Another example:

PRINT@160,"ABC"

will print to cols. 1,2 &3 of line 3, when in 80 column mode.
