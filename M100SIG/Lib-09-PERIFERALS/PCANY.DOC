BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE INFORMATION BELOW IS ACCURATE, BUT I HAVE MADE   
MISTAKES BEFORE SO USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

     Within the past year, a new software product, called PCAnywhere (Dynamic 
Microprocessor Associates Inc., 1986) has been introduced which is billed as 
allowing almost any computer or ASCII terminal to be used as a remote terminal 
for an IBM PC compatible computer.  It accomplishes this by translating 
the keyboard escape sequences and screen attributes of the remote  
computer or terminal so as to emulate an IBM PC keyboard and display, allowing 
it to control most PC functions remotely over the telephone lines.  Set up 
properly, many non-IBM compatible computer or ASCII terminals can  
be made to run popular but memory intensive programs such as Lotus 123,  
Dbase III+, Websters New World Spell Checker, Wordstar 3.3, and others.  
     My motivation for experimenting with the PCAnywhere package was to see if 
this communication package could be used with the Radio Shack Model 100, 
equipped with Disk Video Interface, to emulate an 80X25 IBM PCXT display and/or 
an 80X24 ASCII terminal to run popular MSDOS programs remotely which otherwise
would not run on the Model 100 due to its incompatible 8 bit Z80 based 
operating system and its severe memory limitations (ordinarily a max of 32 k).   
For this purpose, I have used the following equipment:  a 32k Model 100, DVI, 
Worldport 1200 baud external modem & cable; Ultra Computer 640k PCXT clone 
equipped with 20 mb Seagate ST225 Hard disk, OMTI controller, 2400 US Robotics 
Direct Internal Modem; X10 remote telephone switch and remote responder.  With 
this hardware appropriately configured to allow communication over ordinary 
telephone lines between the two computers, I have been able to turn my computer 
on and off remotely and to produce a PC emulation which seems quite adequate  
for my purposes.  Programs for which I have obtained satisfactory results 
to date include Lotus 123 (version 2), Dbase III+, the Websters New World 
Spellchecker, File Express, Wordstar 3.3, and In Control Project Manager.  
Programs which have not worked satisfactorily have included all 
telecommunication packages as well as memory resident programs which use 
interupt 16 on the PCXT in a manner which is incompatible with its use in the 
PCAnywhere program.   
    In this report, I will be limiting myself solely to addressing special   
considerations in customizing the RS Model 100/DVI combination for use as a 
remote terminal for a PCXT compatible computer.  The reader is referred to the 
PCAnywhere documentation for specific instructions on the theory, operation, 
and use of the PCAnywhere program.  In order to use the PCAnywhere 
communications package to configure a non MSDOS compatible computer or 
terminal, such as the Model 100/DVI combination, to run as a remote terminal 
for a PCXT compatible, you must first run the AINSTAll program remotely from 
the Model 100 with DVI.  To do this, the M100/DVI must be able to 
support one of the numerous terminal emulations supported by PCAnywhere.  
Although this fact is nowhere documented in either the Model 100 or DVI 
manuals, the DVI apparently supports the DEC VT-52 terminal emulation since the 
 major DVI escape codes correspond to all the major VT-52 escape sequences.  
Therefore, when running AINSTALL on your PC select the VT-52 terminal option.  
It is then simply a matter of entering the specific DVI screen attribute and 
cursor movement escape sequences from the DVI manual into the appropriate 
prompts from the AINSTALL program menu according to the instructions contained 
in the PCAnywhere manual (See addendum for the DVI Escape Codes to be used).  
In addition to modifying the screen attributes, I recommend modifying the 
prearranged PCAnywhere keyboard sequences, which are used to emulate the PC 
keys and key sequences, to take full advantage of preexisting keys and key  
sequences on the Model 100.  For example, I would recommend customizing the 
predefined PCanywhere keyboard combinations to make full use of the pre- 
existing M100 cursor movement keys, which the PCanywhere AINSTALL program allows 
you to do in its "change keyboard sequence" option.  For example, you can  
replace the predefined PCanywhere 3 key sequences for PgUp and PgDn to the 
much less awkward 2 key combinations on the Model 100 of ESC - up cursor and  
ESC - down cursor respectively.  I also like to substitute the 2 key ESC-tab     
combination on the Model 100 for the predefined PCanywhere 3 key sequence in 
order to refresh the screen when I occasionally get garbage characters.
     Special consideration needs to be paid to a problem posed by the
the way the Model 100 uses the 25th line (Status line) of the DVI display.
Most IBM computers use 25 row displays rather than the 24 row display 
used by most non-IBM computers and terminals.  The Radio Shack DVI does support 
25 rows; however, the 25th row is typically reserved for the function key 
status line which you ordinarily toggle out of by depressing the "label" key.  
Unfortunately, simply configuring the AINSTALL program menu for 25 rows and 
then toggling out of the status line does not allow the DVI to function 
properly.  Nor does configuring PCanywhere for 80 columns and 24 rows 
necessarily solve the problem.  Apparently different MS-DOS applications write 
to the screen using PCanywhere in ways which use the 25th (bottom status) line  
very differently (sometimes even within the same application!).  This often  
results in overwrites to the wrong line and resulting garbage on the screen.  
While PCAnywhere provides a screen refresh key to eliminate such garbage on  
the screen, this can be an annoying and time consuming inconvenience at 1200 
baud, which is the baud rate I operate at for reliability. 
     The simplest away out of this dilemna is to use a DOS shell program in 
running PC programs on your hard disk remotely from your M100/DVI.  This 
apparently standardizes the screen output in applications run from the 
DOS shell program.  I have experimented with the shareware program Hard Disk 
Manager II and thus far have been able to write all major applications to 
the DVI screen with no further difficulty.  I have discovered, however, that to  
do this I must first toggle out of the Tandy function line before enterring 
the HDM2 DOS shell program.  I have accomplished this by calling a batch  
file from the PCAnywhere initial command line which prompts for a pause 
in the execution of the batch file.  At the pause I then toggle out of 
the M100 status line by depressing the label key before enterring HDMII  
automatically from the batch file.   You might want to take this opportunity   
to execute a program like MJOG (memory jogger -- a calendar reminder), as I have   
done, before the pause command in your batch file (useful but not necessary).
     Other useful functions of the PCanywhere program, as implemented on the
Model 100/DVI combination, include the ability to toggle between the upper 24
lines of the display and the lower 24 lines of the display where necessary
for a particular application, remote printing through the serial port of the
Model 100 (must use 300 baud internal modem for this), and password protection
including the use of password tables so that different users may access your
computer using different passwords, terminal emulators, baud rates etc. (helps 
for customer support).  If you get disconnected in an application, PCanywhere
has the ability to return you to the exact point you left off in an 
application before you got disconnected by dialing back in and logging back
on.  If you freeze up the remote keyboard, that's where the x10 remote 
telephone responder comes in handy for a cold boot.  Although PCanywhere`s
Control-Alt-Del warmboot feature does not work on the Model 100/DVI, it
is a relatively simple matter to call a warm-boot utility directly from a
batch file on your PC which then accomplishes the same task from the PC end.
     Although the PCanywhere ASEND remote file transfer program does not work
with nonIBM compatible terminals, it is possible nonetheless to transfer files
over the telephone lines by toggling to another communications program which
contains a host mode.  My personal favorite is PROCOMM 2.42 which has a 
host mode which supports x-modem file transfers and DOS system access.  In
order to get from PCanywhere to Procomm, I create a batch file which invokes
another favorite IBM utility of mine called reconfigure.com.  This program
allows you to reconfigure your autoexec.bat and config.sys files after
rebooting (warmbooting) the system.  This batch file warm boots my system, 
reconfigures my autoexec.bat and config.sys files, and then automatically  
invokes PROCOMM host mode using autologon commands from within  
PROCOMM.  I can then transfer my files between my computers, enter DOS from   
within PROCOMM, and then invoke a second batch command to reconfigure my 
system a second time to warm boot my system and return me to PCanywhere.  
This, of course, requires that you hang up the phone each time your reboot.  
     To date, I have been unable to configure either the m100 or T102 alone, 
with or without the Ultimate ROM II 80 column emulator, to emulate 
satisfactorily my PCXT clone using the PCAnywhere package.  Sorry, folks, but 
the DVI appears to be the best way to use the M100 for this purpose.  I have no 
experience with the T200 or T600 and thus have no way of knowing if their VT-52 
emulation modes might be used for this purpose.  Also, I have been unable 
to get the VT100.100 emulator program to work properly with PCanywhere on M100    
at 300 baud (lack of reverse video capability is a real drawback here).
     I would appreciate any comments or experiences from others in the SIG 
who may be experimenting along similar lines.
