After talking with UltraSoft Innovations about using the tape
based Ultrascreen from a Tandy 2 (or 1) they suggest the
following procedure. (Assumes you are using the stock
Tandy Operating software for either disk drive).
1. Load Ultrascreen (hereafter USC) from tape with the
memory offset you want-62960, or whatever.
2. Copy USC100.CO from main memory to the floppy.
3. Goto basic and kill USC100.CO from main ram menu.
4. Now copy USC100.CO back to memory.
5. Goto basic, type loadm"USC100.CO"
6. You'll get an om error and 3 numbers. Note the first one.
7. Type clear 0,number where number is the first number in step 6
8. Goto main menu, put cursor over usc100.co press enter.
9. Now you may goto basic and kill usc100.co from main
menu.
10.Steps 4-9 should be followed any time you need to re-
install USC.
11.Works from Node 256k as well.
