          Once you have indicated which files are to be killed, DMENU
          will kill them all one by one.  Note that DMENU cannot kill
          itself, so it is safe to select it to be killed.

          The procedure to load or save multiple files resembles the
          procedure for killing them.  The difference is that the first
          question DMENU will ask is "Overwrite all (y/n/a)?"  This
          question refers only to files that must be overwritten (i.e.,
          files already in RAM when you are loading, or files already
          on disk when you are saving.)  DMENU loads all other files
          automatically, without prompts.  Thus, your answer has
          slightly different significance:


             * "y" Means to load or save all the selected files whether
               they already exist in RAM or on disk, respectively, or
               not.

             * "n" Means to load or save only those files that do not
               already exist in RAM or on disk, respectively.

             * "a" Means to ask before overwriting any file.  DMENU
               will never ask about files that do not involve
               overwriting.

          After this question, DMENU will check all the files to see if
          an overwrite is necessary.  Depending on whether you answered
          y, n, or a, it will either automatically overwrite an
          existing file, skip it, or ask you.  "Ask" is usually the
          safest option.


                           Running Programs from DMENU

          You can run BAsic or COmmand files directly from DMENU. 
          Simply move the widebar cursor over the file name and press
          [ENTER].  Exactly what happens depends on the situation.

          BAsic files in RAM will run from DMENU exactly as they will
          from your computer's main menu.  In other words, when source
          is RAM, pressing [ENTER] over a BASIC file is exactly the
          same as pressing [F8], moving the cursor to the BASIC file on
          your computer's menu, and pressing [ENTER]. You save a few
          keystrokes when you do it from DMENU.
          Chapter 3              Using DMENU.BA               Page 21


          If you press [ENTER] to run a BAsic file on disk, DMENU will
          load the file first into the unnamed program area.  The BAsic
          program will then be in RAM, but it will not appear on any
          menu; it will be one of the invisible "memory eaters"
          discussed in Chapter 2.  If you plan on running a program
          several times, it is probably better to load the BAsic file
          into RAM first, then run it from RAM.  There is no extra
          memory required, and you will be able to see the program on
          the menu after running it.  However, for small programs you
          wish to run only once, pressing [ENTER] to load them from
          disk and run them is a convenient shortcut.

          COmmand files are more complex because memory must often be
          reserved before they can be run.  If there is sufficient
          memory reserved to run a COmmand file, DMENU will run it
          without changing the amount of reserved memory.  If there is
          not enough memory reserved, DMENU will reserve just enough to
          run the COmmand file, then run it.  If you do not understand
          the intricacies of COmmand files, you may want to refer to
          Appendix B

          In general, you save memory by running COmmand files directly
          from the disk using the [ENTER] key.  THis is because DMENU
          can move the COmmand file directly from the disk into the
          reserved area, where it runs.  In any case, however, you will
          almost certainly have some memory reserved, which is one of
          the "memory eaters" discussed in Chapter 2.  You will
          probably want to recover this memory eventually.


                            Examining Document Files

          There are times when you may wish to examine a DOcument
          file's contents without going into TEXT.  If you move the
          widebar cursor over a DOcument file (either in RAM or on
          disk), DMENU will display its contents one screen at a time. 
          There is no "word wrap".  At the end of each screen, DMENU
          asks, "More?"  Answer with a "y" for the next screen of the
          file, or "n" to return to the menu display.

                               Errors and Recovery

          Errors in DMENU can occur in either phase, the "menu" phase
          or the "command" phase.  Each phase has its own
          characteristic errors and recoveries.


                            Errors in the Menu Phase

          You cannot run DMENU unless there are at least 1,100 bytes
          showing free on your computer's menu.  The precise
          requirement varies slightly depending on a variety of
          factors.  If there is insufficient memory to run, DMENU will
          show an ?OM error message on the message line, wait for you
          to press a key, and return you to your computer's menu.

          You also must have room for at least one more file in your
          RAM directory for DMENU to work.  It creates a temporary file
          as it is running; if there is no room for that file, you will
          get a #57 error.  When this happens, you must remove one
          file, no matter how small, from RAM before DMENU will work.

          On rare occasions, the PASTE buffer will exhaust the memory
          while you are in the menu phase.  If you run DMENU with very
          few bytes free, it is possible that there are enough bytes
          free to display the files, but not enough to hold the
          commands in the paste buffer.  When this a=happens, you will
          get an ?OM error message and find yourself at the main menu. 
          If you were performing an operation on multiple files, you
          may have better luck if you try doing the operation one at a
          time.

          The only other errors that can happen in the menu phase of
          DMENU are disk related.  These errors generally mean that the
          disk is full or write protected, or that the drive is
          disconnected or malfunctioning.  See Chapter 8 for a complete
          list of disk-related errors.
          Chapter 3              Using DMENU.BA               Page 23


                           Errors in the Command Phase

          In the command phase, an error does not halt execution;
          instead, the PASTE buffer moves on to the next command. The
          errors appear as a normal BASIC error message. An example:


          Kill"0:BB    .DO"
          ?WP Error
          Savem":BB    .DO"
          ?AE Error
          Clear:Gosub2:u= 2:t= 0:goto24


          This sequence would occur if you tried to overwrite BB.DO to
          a write-protected diskette.  The one danger of command-phase
          errors is that you might not notice them - you might think
          that you have updated a disk file, when in fact you have not. 
          For this reason, you should generally watch the command-phase
          execution to check for errors.

          THere are two types of errors in the command phase:
          disk-related, and RAM-related.  Disk-related commands usually
          indicate that the disk is full or write protected. 
          Occasionally there may be an ?IO error, indicating a bad
          disk, or some other problem; usually, if DMENU makes it to
          the command phase without errors, there will be no problems
          with the disk, except write-protection or a full diskette. 
          RAM-related errors include ?OM and ?FL, which occur when the
          free space or the directory are exhausted, respectively. 
          Also, an ?FC error will occur if you try to Kill DMENU
          itself, and an ?AE error will occur if you try to overwrite
          DMENU from the disk.

          Occasionally, the execution phase will prevent the menu phase
          from starting again.  This happens when you fill the memory
          too full in the execution stage, so much so that there isn't
          room to run the menu phase anymore.
