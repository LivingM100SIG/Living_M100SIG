When reloading the Chipmunk Disk Operating System (CDOS), it is safer to use
CALL0 instead of pressing the reset button. CALL0 forces a reload of the
entire operating system whereas the reset button only checks a flag to see
if CDOS is loaded.  If so, it doesn't reload CDOS. You can get into a
situation where CDOS is corrupted but the flag is properly set: *poof*
