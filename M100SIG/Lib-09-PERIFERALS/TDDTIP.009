Subject: Tandy Disk Drive - Function Key Call

For those who might wish to call FLOPPY.CO with a function key rather
than with a short BASIC program (e.g. 10 CALL 59400 stored as DISK.BA),
either function key 6 or 7 is normally unused in BASIC.  The command:

KEY 7,"Disk"+CHR$(24)+"CALL59400"+CHR$(13)

can be entered while in BASIC to set key 7 for use in CALLing FLOPPY.CO once
it has been placed in high memory by LOADMing or by placing the cursor
over FLOPPY and ENTERing.  Once this is done, going into BASIC and pressing key
7 will call the Disk File System.  The purpose of "Disk"+CHR$(24) is to make a
meaningful label (Disk) available while in BASIC.  Additionally, the command:

KEY 6,"Plan"+CHR$(24)+"CALL63012"+CHR$(13)

will make MultiPlan available by the press of function key 6 (assuming
you have the ROM installed).  In this case, "Plan" will show above the key 6
screen identifier.  The purpose of CHR$(24) [Control-X] is to erase the word
Disk or Plan from the BASIC interpreter before proceeding with the CALL
command.  Without "Disk"+CHR$(24) or "Plan"+CHR$(24), the label line would
show CALL for either the Disk System or
MultiPlan function key.  Model 200 users will have to modify the above commands
for their particular CALL addresses.  Your comments are welcome.  Ches Looney

 
(Ed. note: The CALL address for the DOS in the model 200 is 57500. There is no
similar call address for the MSPLAN ROM; see TDDTIP.004)
