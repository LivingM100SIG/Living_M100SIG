I decided to develop this program, DSKLST.100, when my collection of DVI discs,
and the files thereon, became so numerous that I couldn't find anything, and 
when I found something, I wasn't sure what is was that I had found.

The program works on any disc fitted in drive 0 of the DVI.  When run, the 
program first displays a listing to the 40 character screen of all files, 
sorted by type (TEXT, BASIC & ML) and alphebetized.  If the disk has been 
sorted before by this program, then there is a file "INDEX" highlighted on the 
screen.  If this is the first time that the program has been run with this 
disk, you are then asked for a name for the disk; I generally pick a name that 
reflects the contents of the file; a number code system of some sort would do 
as well.  The program then pauses, allowing, if you wish, the screen to be 
dumped to a printer using the PRINT command key.  By using the 40 character 
screen, the text that is dumped is of a width that can be cut out and attached 
to the disk sleeve for reference.

Press any key, and the program resumes, switching to an 80 character wide 
screen, listing out the files singly, in order, along with the description of 
the file if the program has previously processed this disk.  If not, or if you 
have chosen before not to describe a particular file, the program pauses, and 
awaits your entry of a description.  The length of the description is 
unlimited, but longer than the screen line provided makes the subsequent 
presentation messy.  Do not use commas in the description.  If you have 
forgotton what the file contains, and it is a text file, enter "?" and the 
program will print out the first line of the file, up to either the first 
comma, or the first RETURN; each successive pressing of "?" will give another 
line  until you have enough information to formulate a description.  Then press
<ENTER>, and type in the description.  If you choose not to describe the file, 
simply press <ENTER>, and the program will move along to the next file.

On <very rare> occasions, the screen dump of the text file will give an error, 
even though there are traps set to avoid them.  If you do get an error, you can
resume without loss with GOTO 1070.

On reaching the end of the list, the program saves a file called "INDEX" onto 
the disk.  As it is a text file, you may load it into the computer and print it
out if you want a paper listing of the files.

The program was developed for the 100; there doesn't appear to be anything that
would prevent it's use on the 200, but this hasn't been tried.
