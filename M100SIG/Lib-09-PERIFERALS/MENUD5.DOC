=======================================
	UPDATE:07/05/86. I am offering this update mainly because there
seems to be an increased interest in the Disk/Video Interface (mostly likely 
due to the more realistic $199 price of it). I have found it to be a totally 
realiable workhorse.
	Enhancements include: running clock on Line 1; RAM (fre) on Line 1;
 Disk bytes fre on either/both drives; OUTPUT to either CRT: or LPT: 
	Here is the Function Keylist"
	F1:MORE=Continue building menu
	F2:SHOW=Your input to comment field
	F3:DISK=Your input on disk comment
	F4:SIZE=Size of file on disk
	F5:RM#0=Bytes stored/Fre on Drive 0: disk
	F6:RM#2=Bytes stored/Fre on Drive 1: disk
	F7:KILL=Kill .DO or .BA file beneath cursor

==> NEW F8:OUTP=Output 0:filename or 1:filename to <device>
<device>= "CRT:" for Video display; "LPT:" for printer.
	With F8, you have the ability to see what's in the disk file before 
killing RAM files, then downloading/printing. It also provides an easy way
 to see what's on disk in case you've forgotten -- and may just want to kill.
	<Enter> at "Filename" prompt will return you to top of program.
	Otherwise, earlier documentation (below) applies.
	Again, this runs on both/either single/dual disk drive. If you have 
single drive system, you can for instance delete F6 subroutine and 
substitute your own, e.g. MENU.

=======================================
	Based on MENUD.DVI by Joel Orr, MENUD5.DVI offers nearly complete
control of the Radio Shack Disk/Video Interface (DVI) peripheral. DIR.DVI and
SORT.LDR, both in DL5, I belive, must be run prior to running MENUD5.DVI.
Reading docs for all programs is essential.
	One important fact I don't recall seeing in other documentation is that

text and program files must be stored on disk without .DO or .BA extensions.
MENUD5 (and MENUD.DVI) display text files on the menu in upper case, programs
appear in lower case. If files are stored with the extensions, loading,
running, measuring functions on the menu will probably not all work.
	To load a text file or run a program file directly from the menu,
simply place the cursor over it and <enter>. A program will load and run in
Basic, however, if you desire to save it in RAM, use the normal procedure.
	To kill program and text files, hit F7 with the cursor over the
filename.
	Function keys 5 and 6 will return "bytes free" in drives 0 and 1
respectively, regardless of which drive the menu is being built upon.
	Since all Function Keys are used in the program, you will have to hit
shift and break, then F8 to return to the M100 menu.
	Post Script: I have tinkered with DIR.DVI to get it to run on
both drives. But, as it exists now, it runs only on Drive 0.
	However, if the disks are the same, i.e., disk 1 is a backup of disk 0,

simply go into DIRECT.DO on the M100 menu (it has been put there by DIR.DVI),
alter the data appropriate to Drive 1 and save it to Drive 1.  You'll get a
handle on this quickly once you've run the program.
	Enjoy.
