     This is a utility to switch both the DVI driver and POWR-DISK from 
Acroatix. It doesn't have any bells or whistles, but it hasn't cold started the
machine yet, whereas I got one every other day or so using any other method I 
tried. As written, it is also for use with PG Designs 64K bank-switch 
program,"MENU*" (MENU1, MENU2, or MENU3). I save the MENU* in each bank simply 
as "MENU", and rename Acroatix's MENU as "POWR". If you do not have PGD's bank,
change RUN"MENU" in lines 130 and 220 to simply MENU. If you are not using 
SUPER-ROM, you can aslo delete CALL MAXRAM in line 200.
     In operation, the program will first print the present value of MAXRAM (
58363 for the DVI, 60850 for the TDD, and 62960 for no drive), then will prompt
you for your choice. Calling the TDD driver when it is already present will 
reset the hooks after using SUPER-ROM. Switching off the DVI will reset to the 
LCD. Input will default to "No Drive".

     The information needed to develop this program came from a number of 
sources all of which I can't exactly remember, so Thank You All, SIG members 
and vendors alike.
