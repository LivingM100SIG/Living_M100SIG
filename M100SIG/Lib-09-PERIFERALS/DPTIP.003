The DISK POWER manual has been going through some adjusting and fine-tuning
to reflect a few omissions that were made or clarifications necessary.
All new orders will receive the revised manual, but for those DISK POWER owners
with version one of the manual, this
is for you:

1). On page 3 (Loading Instructions from diskette), step 1 should read:
"Make sure that the Model 100 is properly connected to the disk drive,
that both units are powered on, and place the DISK POWER system diskette
in the drive."

2). On page 3 (Loading Instructions from diskette), step 2 should read:
"Using the FLOPPY.CO operating system, load the following files into the
Model 100 RAM:"

3). On page 3 (Loading Instructions from diskette), add to step 5:
     KILL"FLOPPY.CO"  and press <ENTER>
and
     MAXFILES=0       and press <ENTER>
and...

4). On page 6 (Executing/Editing files directly from the directory), add:
"Only filenames with .CO, .BA, .DO extensions can be executed or edited
from the RAM or DISK directories. In the case of non-standard extensions
(ex. .CA, .CT, .CW, etc.), execute these files directly from the Model 100
Main Menu in the normal fashion."

5). On page 11 (Using DISK POWER while in BASIC), add:
"In BASIC, only one disk file can be opened at a time (for INPUT, OUTPUT,
or APPEND). This is a limitation of the disk drive itself, not DISK POWER."

6). On page 13 (Error handling), add the following error in BASIC only:
"   AO --------- already open "

7). On page 1 of U.S. Addendum (Loading instructions from cassette), add step:
"0). Use auto-loader after a cold start to simply and easily install DISK
POWER without first loading FLOPPY.CO and flipping DIP switches. However,
if you have other files in memory, this method will not work."

8). On page 1 of Addendum (Loading Instr. from cas:), step 1 should read:
"Make sure that the Model 100 is properly connected to the disk drive,
that both units are powered on, and place the DISK POWER system diskette
in the drive."


As you can see, these details are not major, but help to fully round-out
the user documentation.
