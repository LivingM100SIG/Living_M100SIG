   USING POWR-DISK WITH SUPER ROM
   ------------------------------

There have been several questions raised regarding the 
compatibility of POWR-D and Super ROM.  Apparently running 
SuperROM resets some pointers used by POWR-D, with the result that
it is non-functional after using Super.  It has been noted that PD
will not save CA & CT files.  In fact, after running Super, it 
won't save BA files either.

There is a simple way to remedy this situation.  After running 
SuperROM and then exiting to the main menu, enter basic and type 
'CALL MAXRAM'.  Apparently this resets the pointers and you can 
then use PD -- and it will then save the Super ROM files.

If you are using one of the SIG menu programs (PDMENU.TDD or 
MENU.JR) you can add this command to the program; for example, the
latest PDMENU.TDD would have a first line looking like this:

0 POKE-86,0:CLS:CALLMAXRAM:CLEAR100:DIMT(5):GOSUB14:LFILESTO:REM 
PDMENU.V05 PD V100.1.1

I believe this is the approach suggested by Acroatix in a message 
several weeks ago.  I'm not sure why it works, but it does!  It 
may be useful if PD shows incompatibilities with other software or
ROM's.
