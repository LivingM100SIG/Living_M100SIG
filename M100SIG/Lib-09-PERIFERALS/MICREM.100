It is a simple schematic diagram of a
sub-mini jack that the remote plug of
the M100 cassette cable plugs into!
I just installed it in my Sony M-202
micro-recorder, and now my M100 can
turn my Sony M-202 off and on any time
it wants to!

The trick to installing it in any
micro-recorder is: (1) solder a wire
between points 1 and 2; (2) cut the
wire to the positive (outside) post
of the DC INPUT jack; (3) connect the
above sub-mini jack point 3 to this
positive post of the DC INPUT jack;
and (4) connect the above sub-mini
point 1 to the other end of the cut
wire.

Using this technique, the remote sub-
mini jack will operate if either the
micro-recorder's batteries or its DC
INPUT jack is used for power!
