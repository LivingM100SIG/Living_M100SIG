MERGE BUG
=========

POWR-DOS 100.2.1 has a bug which prevents MERGE from working from the TDD, as 
well as LOAD and RUN when the argument is an ASCII coded BASIC program on the 
TDD.  We have a fix to this bug, and some time soon a newsletter will announce 
an update.

In the meantime, you can work around the problem with the following two POKES. 
To execute them, get into BASIC and enter the following line:

POKE 64245,193:POKE 64255,77 <ENTER>

(<ENTER> is the ENTER key.)  After this, the problem will be gone!  However, 
this really isn't a "fix" to POWR-DOS.  Instead, it is workaround.  After a 
coldstart, or after any software runs that CALLs 32454 (you'll find out what 
that is when it happens), the bug will again buzz you, and you'll have to enter
the POKEs again.

However, other than that, the fix is perfect.  There should be no side effects 
or compatibility problems with any known software.
