Several procedures for dealing with memory conflicts with machine language 
programs and POWR-D software have been suggested in the user manual as well as 
in Acroatix newsletter.

All these are quite workable, but the simple program which follows is my 
favorite for convenience and simplicity.  As long as the ML program in question
does not require disk access through POWR-D (Floppy provides its own access of 
course), rather than worry about relocating it is easier to simply store POWR-D
out of the way.  PWRDSW is a short program which can be kept in ram at all 
times.  Selecting it from the menu will alternately enable and disable POWR-D 
as required.

For example, to use Floppy, load it directly to ram with the ',F' option, run 
PWRDSW to disable POWR-D, and use Floppy as required.  When done, kill Floppy 
and run PWRDSW once again to restore POWR-D features.

(According to the documentation, the CALL MAXRAM+12 in line 40 should not 
normally be necessary, however I have had trouble at times with the LFILES OFF 
and LFILES MENU commands when Floppy has been run, this call seems to resolve 
the problem.)
