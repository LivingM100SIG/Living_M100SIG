TDDMON.100 -- A Disk Examine and Patch Utility
----------------------------------------------

TDDMON.100 is a utility for examining TDD disks on a sector/byte
basis, one sector at a time, with POWR-DOS installed.  It is based
on MONTOR.100 (DL4), which is based on LOOKIT.100 by Joel Hassell,
also in DL4.

When you run this program you will be asked for a starting sector.
The program will read the sector into RAM (HIMEM to MAXRAM, with
HIMEM=MAXRAM-1292).  It then enters the examination and patch
mode -- where you can change a byte just by typing in a new hex
value. The left column of numbers is the sector (one or two
digits, in decimal) and the row's offset from the start of the
sector (four hex digits). 

Move within the sector using the cursor keys (alone, shifted or with
CTRL). Note that MAXRAM is at 050C hex -- so here and beyond you are
in SYSTEM RAM!  Similarly, if you go back before 0000 hex, you
may be in a buffer or a RAM file.  Do not patch anything in these
areas!!  The new version of 10/11/86 shows you when you have gone
below HIMEM ("LoRAM") or above MAXRAM ("HiRAM"); but the last four
bytes of the highest "normal" line are above the sector.

Be careful not to hit the function keys in this mode.  They can modify
the byte under the cursor!

To get out of this mode, hit the ESC key.  You will then be given
some options, which are pretty self-explanatory.  One option,
Write Sector to Disk, will replace the sector on the disk by the
one in RAM -- so you can change disk contents a byte at a time.
Another option lets you dump the sector to a RAM file of your
chice; this can be used for recovering ASCII files (ONLY).

This is definitely a hackers tool!  It is offered for use in the
current thrust to utilize POWR-DOS effectively.  It has NO error
trapping.  Use it at your own risk, especially the "Write Sector
to Disk" option!
