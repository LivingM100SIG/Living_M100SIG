                PIP V1.4 12/28/85  [c]  Woods Martin         Page   1  

        PIP is a peripheral interchange utility program to facilitate the 
        management of programs and files on the Model 100 computer and its 
        peripheral devices.  PIP does not currently support other computers, 
        the Tandy Portable Disk Drive or non-Tandy disk or wafer tape storage 
        devices. 

        PIP is provided freely to all users on the Honor System.  Try PIP as 
        long as you like and share it with your friends.  If you wish to keep 
        and use it, please send $10 to Woods Martin, 5517 Sturbridge, Houston, 
        TX 77056.  This helps to pay for my time on the SIGS used in uploading 
        new programs and assisting users with applications and problems.  
        Assistance with PIP problems (as far as I am able) comes with your 
        contribution. 

        PIP uses keyboard entry or command files to provide: 

                  COPY     programs/files between devices 
                  KILL     files in Model 100 memory or disk 
                  RENAME   files in Model 100 memory or disk 
                  RUN      another program from PIP 
                  DISPLAY  Model 100 or disk directories 
                  DATE, DAY and TIME entry 
                  DVI and SCREEN control (if Disk Video Interface used)  

        ASCII files such as ADRS.DO and programs in Basic tokenized form as 
        well as in machine language can be easily transferred between all 
        Tandy devices.  PIP is compatible with the Tandy Disk Video Interface, 
        switching Disk Basic in and out on command or when necessary to load a 
        high memory ML program. 

        PIP can copy, rename or kill individual files or groups of files using 
        "wildcard" commands in which the symbol "*" can indicate any filename 
        or extension and the symbol "?" can indicate any character within a 
        filename or extension.  When copying groups of files to disk or 
        cassette from another device, PIP puts a command/directory file on the 
        destination device for later use by PIP to exactly reverse the 
        transfer process, restoring the source device (usually RAM memory) to 
        its original condition prior to the transfer.  In addition, when the 
        transfer is to cassette, PIP puts a copy of itself on the cassette, 
        creating a self loading tape which can restore the memory of a new or 
        cold-started machine.  A series of tapes can be produced, each of 
        which will configure the Model 100 differently. 

        PIP will also accept commands from a script or command file prepared 
        by the Model 100 TEXT program.  Usually the file name is entered at 
        the pip> prompt but the name can be assigned in the program at Line 25 
        (25 FI="CAS:C") for completely automatic operation. 

        PIP will be retained in Model 100 RAM memory under the name PIP.BA 
        when it has completed the script of commands but can be deleted if 
        preferred by using the KILL PIP.BA command.  A copy exists at the 
        beginning of each PIP tape and can easily be reloaded with CLOAD if 
        needed.

                                      RUNNING PIP 

        If PIP is not in RAM memory, it may be loaded from Cassette, Disk or 
        through the COM: or MDM: ports.  Once loaded, press F4 to RUN.  PIP 
        will save itself to RAM if not already there.  After the initial 
        message, the command prompt  pip>  will display in reverse video to 
        indicate that a command may be entered. 

                                      EXITING PIP 

        Pressing F8 or ENTER or typing MENU ENTER will return control to the 
        Model 100 MENU program and reset the display to the LCD: with a width 
        of 40 in case the DVI screen has been in use. 

                                     PIP COMMANDS 

        SLASH COMMANDS WITHOUT FILE ARGUMENTS:

                  /R   -  remove  disk basic                   (are preserved. 

        COMMANDS WITH FILE ARGUMENTS 

        A complete command consists of: 

                  COMMAND SOURCE FILE SEMI-COLON DESTINATION FILE 

        A complete file specification consists of device, filename and 
                   extension: 

                       Source              Destination 
                   DVS:  =device       DVD:  =device 
                   SORFIL=filename*    DESFIL=filename* 
                   .EXS  =extension*   .EXD  =extension* 

                     *Wildcard symbols (* ??) permitted 

        Valid SOURCE devices (DVS:) are RAM:, CAS:, 0: (disk 0), 1: (disk 1), 
        COM: and MDM:.  All of these can also be DESTINATION devices (DVD:) 
        and in addition, output can be directed to LPT: (printer), LCD: (Model 
        100 display) and CRT: (Disk Video Interface video display). 

        SORFIL is always required (with .EXS extension for RAM: and disk 
        files) while the DESFIL is either optional or not used depending on 
        the command.

                                     COPY COMMAND 

        COPY [the command is optional] is the general transfer command which 
        will request BA, DO or CO file type if needed. (C.BA, C.DO and C.CO 
        are special COPY commands which will force the transfer type indicated 
        and which must be used in script command files.)  Text below in 
        brackets [] is optional; If omitted the default will be used. 

                  [COPY] DVS:SORFIL.EXS[;DVD:DESFIL.EXD] 
                              defaults: 
                   COPY  RAM:______.___ ;RAM:SORFIL.EXS 

                  IF .EXS or .EXD is not BA, DO or CO, the file type will be 
                   requested. 

        Examples: (Commands may be UPPER or lower case or mixed) 

        Copy a file in Model 100 RAM memory named ADRS.DO to cassette.  Any of 
                  the following commands could be used: 

                  COPY RAM:ADRS.DO;CAS:ADRS 
                  COPY ADRS.DO;CAS: 
                  ADRS.DO;CAS:            (COPY implied) 

                  For copies to or from cassette, 
                          Cassette Ready YNQ_ 
                  will be displayed.  Press Y to continue. 

        Any of these will copy a Basic program on cassette named GAME to RAM: 

                  COPY CAS:GAME;RAM:GAME.BA 
                  CAS:GAME;.BA 
                  CAS:GAME        (pip> will request file type = .BA) 

        Copy disk 0 machine language program SORTER.ML to RAM: 

                  COPY 0:SORTER.ML;RAM:SORTER.CO 
                  0:SORTER.ML;.CO 
                  0:SORTER.ML     (pip> will request file type = .CO) 
                  0:SORTER.ML;DIRSRT.CO      (name change is Ok) 

        Copy disk 0 ASCII file WORDS.TXT to cassette: 

                  copy 0:words.txt;cas:words.do 
                  0:words.txt;cas:.do 
                  0:words.txt;cas: (pip> will request file type = .DO) 

        Copy (display) disk 1 ASCII file WORDS.TXT to DVI screen: 

                  Copy 1:words.txt;crt:words.do 
                  1:words.txt;crt:.do 
                  1:words.txt;crt: (pip will request file type = .DO)

                  DVD:.             same name, no extension 

        Examples of COPY using wildcard commands: 

        Copy all RAM files to cassette: 

                  COPY *.*;CAS:* 
                  *.*;CAS: 

                  pip> will ask for confirmation (Yes No Quit) 
                  for each file unless  /G  switch is used. 

                  Cassette Ready YNQ_  --  will display when all files are 
                  selected.  A copy of PIP itself along with a restore command 
                  file will also be placed on the tape to make it self-loading 
                  for later use in restoring this or other Model 100's to a 
                  specific memory configuration.  To restore, make the 
                  cassette ready and type CLOAD ENTER.  When  Found PIP  
                  followed by  Ready  appears, press  F4  to run.  The rest is 
                  automatic. 

        Copy disk 0: files with DIR as first three characters to RAM. 

                  COPY 0:DIR???.*;RAM:*.* 
                  0:dir???.* 

                  pip> will request confirmation for each file selected unless 
                  the  /G  switch is used.  File type will be requested unless 
                  the disk file extension is .BA, .CO or .DO. 

        Copy all RAM Basic programs to disk: 

                  *.BA;0: 
                  Confirmation will be requested.  When all programs have been 
                  selected, an option will be offered to write a restore 
                  command file to disk. 

        Copy all RAM .DO files to disk with extension of .TXT: 

                  *.do;0:.txt

                                  KILL (or K) COMMAND 

        Kill will delete files from either RAM memory or Disk.  Individual 
        files may be killed or groups of files using wildcard symbols. 

                  KILL DVS:SORFIL.EXS  or  K DVS:SORFIL.EXS 

                  The source device will default to RAM: but the source 
                  filename and extension are required. 

        Delete file WORDS.DO from RAM memory: 

                  K[ILL] RAM:WORDS.DO 
                  K[ILL] WORDS.DO 

        Delete all .BA files from Disk #0: 

                  K[ILL] 0:*.BA 

                  Unless the /G switch is used (K[ILL] 0:*.BA/G), pip> will 
                  request confirmation for each individual .BA file. 

        A disk file might not have an extension: 

                  K[ILL] 1:SORTER. 

                  Even so, the period after the filename is required. 

                                  NAME (or N) COMMAND 

        The NAME command will rename files in RAM or on Disk, individually or 
        using wildcard symbols: 

                  NAME DVS:SORNAM.EXS;NEWNAM.NEX  or  N 
                  DVS:SORNAM.EXS;NEWNAM.NEX 

                  The source device DVS: will default to RAM: but the SORNAM 
                  and .EXS are required.  (For disk files with no extension, 
                  the period is needed.) 

        Rename RAM file PIP.BA to PIPNEW.BA: 

                  N[AME] RAM:PIP.BA;PIPNEW.BA 
                  N[AME] PIP.BA;PIPNEW. 

        Rename all disk files with .DO extension to .TXT extension: 

                  N[AME] 0:*.DO;*.TXT 
                  N[AME] 0:*.DO;.TXT 

        Rename all RAM files so that last three characters of file name are 
                  NEW: 

                  N[AME] *.*;???NEW.* 










                PIP V1.4 12/28/85  [c]  Woods Martin         Page   6  

                  As with COPY and KILL, individual confirmation for each file 
                  matched will be requested unless the  /G  switch is appended 
                  to the end of the command. 


                                     /G switch  GO 

                  Use with wildcard commands only. 

                  If "/G" is appended to a wildcard command: 

                  *.*;CAS:/G 
                  K[ILL] 0:*.DO/G 
                  N[AME] 1:*.BA;.BAS/G 

                  PIP will request confirmation only once and will then 
                  proceed automatically. 

                                      RUN COMMAND 
         
        Another program can be invoked from the  pip>  prompt by typing: 

                  RUN DVS:SORFIL.EXS 

                                SCRIPT (COMMAND) FILES: 

        A .DO file on a device containing a script of commands to be 
        automatically executed by PIP.  At the pip> prompt, enter the command 
        file name preceded by an "@" character (ex:  @0:PIPCMD.2).  The script 
        file must contain explicit COPY commands C.BA, C.DO or C.CO and 
        wildcards are not permitted.  If the first character in a command line 
        is a semi-colon (;), the line will be treated as a comment only and 
        can be used to identify the file. 

        Example of disk restore file 0:PIPCMD.2 as produced automatically as a 
        result of the command 

                  COPY DIR???.*;0: 

        A similar command file could be entered with TEXT.
