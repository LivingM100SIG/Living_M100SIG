DDIR.TDD -- Single Screen Directory
-----------------------------------

DDIR.TDD gives a true single-screen directory for the TDD using
POWR-DOS.  It is an adaptation of Don Zeikel's DFILES.TDD.

The line numbers have been set-up so this program can be merged
with Joel Dinda's MENU.JR2, as follows:

1. In MENU.JR2: In line 0 replace GOSUB10,7 by GOSUB30,7

2. In DDIR.100: Delete line 0.  Delete     LFILESV in line 30.  In
   line 55 replace MENU with GOTO0

This adds some to the file length -- but has the advantage of
giving only one menu entry.  By the way, I've labeled key 7 in
MENU.JR2 as 'Filn' and made it call line 10 -- so I can get either
the full page option or the file length option.

The full-screen display was one of several I experimented with.
It turns out to be similar to the one used in Disk Power 100 --
except mine provides the second letter of the extension, in
reverse video.
