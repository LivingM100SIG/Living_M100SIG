  Chipmunk (and DVI) disk drives are able to provide this capability.
  Unfortunately, the Tandy Portable Disk Drives (TDD & TDD2) suffer in this
  regard, due to their use of the RS-232 for interfacing with the computer.
  This file captures typical messages on this subject.

  Erase deletes every file of a TDD diskette; it's equivalent to the PC-DOS
  command ERASE *.*. Obviously this is not an everyday utility.  But Erase.TDD
  is *much* quicker than reformatting the diskette. This program works with
  M100/T102 & Powr-DOS on TDD1 *or* M100/T102/T200 & FLOPPY on TDD2 (scratches
  both directories); it checks what's there and acts appropriately.

  FLOPPY) to read and write sectors.  You can (for example) modify file names
  on a disk to load otherwise unloadable files.  Or you can use the dump
  function to recover data from trashed disks. Or you can just explore the

  Title   :
  Keywords: BASIC 100 PCSG SUPER WRITE ROM WSPEC .DT .CW RENAME

  This program provides a means to covert PCSG's Write ROM `WSPEC'
  file extensions from the old `.DT' to the newer `.CT' format, or to
  any combination you may need to store multiple files on disk.  The
  familiar M100 command NAME"wspec.dt"TO"wspec.cw"
  or NAME"ram:wspec.dt"TO"ram:wspec.cw" will not convert the old extensions,
  nor will the Rename feature in Chipmunk CDOS, but this program will.
  Enjoy! Bill Templeton / Danville Tigers
