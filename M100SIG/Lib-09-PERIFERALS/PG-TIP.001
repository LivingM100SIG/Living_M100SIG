Linefeed Toggle for PG RAM Menu Program
---------------------------------------

I use the linefeed toggle in the PG RAM MENU/0MENU utility to send
linefeeds to my printer.  But when setting up the printer from a
Basic program, an annoying extra linefeed will result at exit --
unless the LF patch is disabled while setting up the printer.

Of course, it is possible to disable the patch and reinstall it by
hitting F7 before entering the printer set-up program and then
hitting F7 at exit from the program.

It is better to do it from software.  And here's how.

1) At the beginning of your printer set-up program use the
   following line of code:

   IF PEEK(34177)=110 AND PEEK(32816)=50 THEN CALL 34106

   This code checks to see if the LF patch is on (and tests
   whether 0MENU vers 2.0+ is installed), and toggles the patch
   OFF if it is ON.

2) Just before leaving the program, add the following code:

      IF PEEK(34177)=102 THEN CALL 34106

   This code will toggle the LF patch to ON if it was OFF.

The following information from Peter Van Heusden of PG Designs
(plus some disassembly) led to the above:

     o LF patch annunciator ("n" or "f") stored at 8581h (34177d)

     o Program byte toggled for LF patch is at  8554h (34132d).
       It is C9h (201d) when the LF patch is OFF and C0h
       (192d)when ON.

     o From this information, a direct patch approach would be to
       POKE both bytes to the desired state.  The CALL approach
       gets both bytes and assures that they are always
       consistent.
