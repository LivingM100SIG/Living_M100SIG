                                 Using DMENU.BA


          DMENU.BA is the central application program of POWR-DOS.  It
          is a menu program that simplifies your access to the disk. 
          Once you acquaint yourself with DMENU's features and
          conveniences, you may find it the most-used program in your
          computer.

          This chapter first presents how you can use DMENU to perform
          the most basic operation involving disk and RAM; then it
          describes some of the convenient DMENU features.  Finally, it
          discusses the errors that can occur during the program.

          If is important from the outset to realize two aspects of
          DMENU.BA.  First, it is simply a BASIC program.  It uses
          POWR-DOS commands to access the disk just as any other
          program could.  So, if you remove DMENU, you can still access
          the disk using the techniques described in Chapter 2. 
          Second, DMENU operates in two phases.  In the first phase,
          you select files you want to operate on and the operation
          (either Load, Save, or Kill).  In the second phase, DMENU
          "types" in the commands into your computer's PASTE buffer and
          "pushes" the PASTE key.  At this point, you will see the
          commands appear on the computer screen; you could just as
          easily have typed these commands yourself, with the same
          results.  Further, if you "break" the PASTE" buffer by
          pressing SHIFT-BREAK, you will be in BASIC; simply enter the
          RUN command to resume DMENU.

                                Basic Procedures


                                  Viewing Files

          When you run DMENU, the first screen it shows you is a
          display of the files in RAM:


                     ----------------------------------------

                     ----------------------------------------


          (Note: The Tandy 200 screen is slightly different.)  There
          are a few terms specific to the menu program.  The source is
          simply RAM or PDD, depending on whether you are looking at
          files in RAM or files on disk, respectively.  The message
          line is the penultimate line on the screen, which is reserved
          for prompts and messages from DMENU.  The widebar cursor is
          the "bar" of inverse video that appears over a file name. 
          The arrow keys and the space bar move the widebar cursor just
          a s with your computer's main menu.  Finally, a file is
          selected when its name appears in inverse video.  The file
          name with the wide-bar cursor is always selected; more than
          one file can be selected, as shown later.

          You can change the source from RAM to PDD by pressing [F6]. 
          When the source is PDD, pressing [F6] again will change the
          source back to RAM.  If you are looking at PDD files and you
          change diskettes, press [F6] twice to change the files to RAM
          and back to PDD; this "double switch" refreshes the display
          with file names on the new diskette.

          The file names on the screen appear without the extension
          names.  There are two ways to see the extension name of a
          file.  First, by moving the widebar cursor over a file.  The
          extension appears in the upper right-hand corner of the
          screen.  Second, by pressing [F4].  The full name of the file
          under the widebar cursor will appear on the message line,
          along with its length.

                              Saving a File to Disk

          To save a file to disk, set the source to RAM.  Move the
          widebar cursor to the file you wish to save, then press [F2]. 
          If the files does not already exist on disk, DMENU will save
          it immediately.  However, if the file already exists on disk,
          you will see the question "Overwrite 0:file.xx (y/n)" appear
          on the message line.  (instead of file.xx, you will see the
          file name you are saving.)  Press a "y" if you wish to
          overwrite the existing file on disk; otherwise, press "n". 
          There is no need to press [ENTER] because DMENU will react as
          soon as you press the key.


                             Loading a file into RAM

          To load a file from disk into RAM, set the source to PDD. 
          From then on, follow the exact procedure above for saving
          files to disk.  You will notice that the bottom LCD line
          shows "Save" over the [F2] label when the source is RAM, and
          "Load" when the source is PDD.


                                 Killing a File

          To kill a file, select the file with the widebar cursor, then
          press [F3].  DMENU will always prompt you with the message
          "Kill ext:file.xx (y/n)?" where "ext" is the extension
          (either RAM: or 0: for RAM or disk, respectively).  If you
          press a "y" DMENU will kill the file; if you press an "n" it
          will ignore the [F3] you pressed. If the source is RAM, the
          file killed will be a RAM file; if the source is PDD, the
          file killed will be a disk file.


                                  Leaving DMENU

          Pressing [F8] will return you to your computer's main menu
          regardless of the source.

                                Notes and Options


                                 Multiple Pages

          On the Model 100 version (only), it is possible that there
          will be more files on disk than will fit on one screen.  When
          this happens, you can use [F5] to toggle between two pages of
          files.  Whenever there is another page to be displayed, the
          bottom LCD line will show the word "Page" over the [F5]
          label.


                            Selecting Multiple Files

          DMENU is most effective when you can select multiple files to
          load, save, or kill.  You can reduce the number of keystrokes
          and time for these three operations whenever you want them
          done for more than one file.  Get into the habit of looking
          over all the files before loading, saving, or killing. 
          Select all the files for the operation, then press [F2] or
          [F3] as required.

          As noted above, the widebar cursor is always over one
          selected file.  Moving the widebar cursor normally
          "unselects" one file and selects another.  However, pressing
          [F1] will leave a file selected even after you move the
          cursor.  For example, if you press [F1] and then the space
          bar, the screen shown above will as follows:

                        (brackets indicate reverse video)

          You now have selected two files.  You can repeat the process
          to select as menu files as you like.  In addition, you can
          use the [F1] key to quickly select all the files or
          "unselect" all the files.  If you press [F1] repeatedly
          without moving the widebar cursor, the following sequence
          will occur:


             * The first [F1] will permanently select the file under
               the widebar cursor;

             * The second [F1] will select all the files on the screen
               (it will not select files on the second page, if there
               is one.

             * The third [F1] will "unselect" all the files on the
               screen.  Then fourth [F1] acts like the first did, and
               so on.


          Once you have selected many files on the display, it can
          become difficult to tell where the widebar cursor is, or what
          the extension of a particular file is.  When this happens,
          use [F4] to printout the filename; [F4] always prints out the
          full filename (and length) of the file under the widebar
          cursor.


                         Operations with Multiple Files

          Load, Save, and Kill operations proceed almost identically
          with multiple files as with single files.  The only
          differences involve checking for overwrites.

          The simplest multiple-file operation to perform is Kill. 
          Whenever you have multiple files selected and press [F3],
          DMENU will print the question, "Kill all (y/n/a)?" on the
          message line.  Respond with one of the following letters:


             * "y" will kill all the selected files without further
               pause.

             * "n" will abort the multiple kill entirely. All the files
               will remain selected.

             * "a" will make DMENU display each of the selected files
               one by one and ask you either to kill it or not.
