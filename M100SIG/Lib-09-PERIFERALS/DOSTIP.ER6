Unofficial correction to DOSTIP.006

There appears to be a typographical error in DOSTIP.006 (PowrDos will not 
operate properly with that change as written).  It appears that the correct 
pokes are:

  POKE 64254,193:POKE 64255,77 <ENTER>

This appears to correct LOAD [ascii]; however MERGE still is not correct in that
it will erase any lines in BASIC just as if LOAD were called.
