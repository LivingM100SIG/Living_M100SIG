          The text at the top of the screen shows where the edit
          portion will start.  When you see this screen, you must
          decide from the text presented whether this is an appropriate
          place to "Start" the edit portion.  If it is, press [ENTER];
          if not, press any other key, in which case D-TEXT will show
          you the next possible place to "Start" the edit portion.

          Similarly, if you have opted to "set" the stop point for the
          edit portion, a screen similar to the following will appear:


                     ----------------------------------------
                    |                                        |
                    |        sta     scr3:                   |
                    |        call    tod:    ;set up         |
                    |        mvi     a,1                     |
                    |        sta     scr2:                   |
                    |        call    4bb8h   ;new ln if nec. |
                    |        mvi     m,scr1  ;next 8 files   |
                    |<Key> for More, <ENTER> to END          |
                     ----------------------------------------


          In this case, the text shows the last characters that will
          appear in the edit portion.  If they are an appropriate place
          to stop, press [ENTER]; otherwise, press any other key. 
          D-TEXT will continue showing you more possible places to stop
          the edit portion until you either press [ENTER], reach the
          end of the file, or reach the limit of the RAM.

          After you have selected the limits, D-TEXT automatically puts
          you into TEXT.  When you are done editing the edit portion,
          press [F8] to leave TEXT.  D-TEXT will ask you "Save Changes
          (y/n)?"  If you answer "n", you will return immediately to
          the D-TEXT menu; if you answer "y", D-TEXT will update the
          disk file with the contents of the edit portion.  This
          process can take a while for a large file, so be patient.

          Important Note: The D-TEXT program chooses the Start and Stop
          points arbitrarily.  In many cases you will see words split;
          on occasion, you may even see Control-J or Control-M as the
          first or last charter in an edit portion.  Do not try to
          "fix" these breaks!  When D-TEXT puts the edit portion back
          into the disk file, it will restore any breaks automatically. 
          If you "fix" them while in TEXT, whey will not go together
          properly.


                                Notes and Options


                            Adding New Print Formats

          It is possible to add new print formats to D-TEXT.  Each
          format is in a data statement; you can add as many additional
          data statements as necessary.  The DATA statement contains a
          wide variety of information.  In order to simplify the
          creation of a new DATA statement, we provide a small program
          called PRFORM.BA, which asks the following questions:


             * The number of formats already available in D-TEXT.  If
               you are not sure, use [F1] to count the different
               formats.  It is important to correctly answer this
               question; if you answer with less than the correct
               number, PRFORM will replace one of the old formats with
               the new one.  (You can use this behavior to replace or
               modify existing formats if you wish).

             * The name of this new format.  Use 10 charters or less.

             * The left margin.  How many characters from the left
               should the printout start?

             * The width of text.  How many characters wide should a
               printed line be, maximum?

             * Printed Lines per Page.  How many lines of text should
               be in the body, which excludes top and bottom margins?

             * Spacing.  Answer 1 for single spacing, 2 for double
               spacing, etc.

             * Print a header?  THe header always consists of the date,
               time, file name, and page number.  If you answer yes,
               you can specify the starting page number.  Often, page 2
               is the first header page.
          Chapter 5              Disk-Based TEXT              Page 37


             * CRLF Pairs?  If your printer requires an additional line
               feed with a carriage return, answer "yes".  Answer "no"
               for Radio Shack Printers.

             * Lines at top of page.  How many blank lines will be at
               the tip of each page.  Note that this number is
               independent of single spacing or double spacing.

             * Does the printer accept form feed? if not, how may blank
               lines at the end of the page?

             * Page Pause?  Does the printing process need to pause at
               the end of each page?


          Once you have answered all of these questions, PRFORM will
          ask you to confirm that you like your responses.  If you do,
          it will automatically modify D-TEXT to add the new printer
          format.


                                 Editing Options

          The file status screen gives you several options when editing
          the text file.  Wrap lets you turn the "word-wrap" feature of
          TEXT off for a given editing session.  Normally, you almost
          always will want word wrap on, but for some data and program
          files, it is nicer to work without it.  Buffer allows you to
          reserve a minimum amount of RAM for adding to a files.  This
          feature can come in handy if you are dealing with large files
          and you want to "reserve" room for an anticipated addition. 
          Finally, the "Top" and "End" settings can be changed for any
          file, not just large files.  Using this feature, you can
          exercise considerable control over your DOcument files.


                           Accessing the Disk in TEXT

          One highly convenient feature of D-TEXT is your access to
          disk files from within the TEXT program itself.  [F2] and
          [F3] can access disk files as described in Chapter 2.  This
          may seem a minor convenience, but it has many interesting
          applications.  Two examples:
          Chapter 5              Disk-Based TEXT              Page 38


             * You can use D-TEXT to concatenate large files.  Simply
               use D-TEXT to "Append" onto one disk file, then loading
               a second disk file onto the end using [F2].

             * You can CUT and PASTE very large file segments, larger
               than you could manage in RAM, by saving them to
               temporary files from within TEXT.


                               Errors and Recovery

          D-TEXT handles errors in a very similar fashion to the "menu"
          phase of DMENU.  The error will be displayed on the message
          line, and you must press a key to continue the program.  The
          only difference is that for some errors, you will return
          automatically to DMENU (or to your computer's menu) after the
          error.

          D-TEXT must access the disk many times when it reads and
          updates files.  If an error occurs before you enter the TEXT
          program, no change will have occurred to the disk, so it is
          best to start D-TEXT over.  If the error persists, perhaps
          the file has gotten an error in it.  If an error occurs while
          you are "saving changes" to a files, there are several
          possibilities.  Part of the DOcument files may be in RAM, and
          the DOcument file on disk may contain some or all of the
          original data.  Also, RECOVR (see Chapter 6) may be able to
          find additional data on the disk.
