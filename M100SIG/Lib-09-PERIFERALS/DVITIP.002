SCRIPSIT.100 (c) 1983 Portable Computer Support Group (licensed to Tandy Corp.)
may easily be modified to work with the Tandy Disk/Video Interface (DVI), and 
can be run entirely from disk with all features supported. Here's how:

 1) Enter the command: SOUND OFF.

 2) LOAD WSPEC.DO and WRITE.BA from the cassette & reSAVE to DVI disk (that 
you've already FORMATted & contains SYSTEM tracks).

 3) LOAD CORTNS.BA from cassette, and RUN it to load CORTNS.CO.

 4) SAVEM CORTNS.CO to disk at 58073,58262 (SAVEM "0:CORTNS.CO",58073,58262 is 
how you key it in; the SCRIPSIT manual describes both CORTN1 & CORTN2- you'll 
SAVE/LOAD CORTN2 only- it will actually be CORTNS.CO - Do NOT do anything with 
CORTN1 as it is not needed with DVI & conflicts with Disk Basic). CORTNS.CO is 
an invisible file in RAM, when loaded, so won't appear on MENU.

 5) EDIT CORTNS.BA, line 3, to read: "LOADM"0:CORTNS.CO".

 6) Then save the new version of CORTNS.BA to disk. By now you have all the 
SCRIPSIT files on the DVI disk.

 7) To run, just LOAD WSPEC & the basic files, and after LOADing CORTNS.BA, 
RUN, and then RUN 50. The instructions in the SCRIPSIT manual, page 4, Special 
Loading instructions (cont. on page 5), give the order to load the programs  
into RAM from mass storage (like DVI), & this can be accomplished from 
MENUD.DVI if you use it.

 8) Put the cassette away (forever, it is hoped), be sure to make a backup of 
your DVI disk, & then enter the command SOUND ON.

 9) SCRIPSIT.100, as modified herein, will work either with an 80 col. monitor 
or the LCD. Use of the dot commands as described in the SCRIPSIT manual, is 
easy, as long as you use exactly what your printer calls for. For example, the 
Okidata needs the escape key (ESC) to precede many commands, and that is what 
must be depressed for use with the Oki (ESC shows up as an [ when used this way
). Other printers have different sequences, so check your printer's manual. 
HINT: when underlining, be sure to end each line with the appropriate "end 
underlining" dot command, & then enter the "restart underlining" dotcommand 
again at the beginning of the next, & so on. Above all, please don't try to use
these instructions without reading the SCRIPSIT.100 manual FIRST, & then having
it at hand to reread along with these instructions, step by step, as every 
other direction in the manual applies. Good luck! Maddi Durholz 70466,1511 (
