Please help an ex-100 (I'm sorry, but just had to have compatibility with PCs
and clones at work) user.  A friend asked me for help in printing a DO file
from the 100 - seems that pressing the PRINT button printed only the screen
contents (I know that's normal) and also set the printer to compressed print.
I pulled my old 100 back into service and duplicated that phenomenon, but have
no recollection of that from earlier use.  If it is normal, why was the 100
implemented to send a printer compressed-print code when printing the screen
content of a DO file?  Thanks for response(s) and Best Regards, Ches.

The text that is on your screen when editing a DO file, is also duplicated in
the LCD buffer area (another portion of RAM).  When you use the PRINT SCREEN
function, it is this buffer that gets printed, not a portion of the text file.

As this buffer contains what is on the LCD, it has in it the character that is
used to represent the CRLF.  This character, which appears as a black, left
pointing-triangle, is a chr$(143) (GRPH-e) and although the chr$(143) is not
part of your DO file, is part of the data in the LCD buffer.

It gets sent as part of the print screen routine, and this is the character
that puts your printer into condensed mode. Many printers which take control
codes as print commands, also accept the command + 128 as well.  So the
chr$(143) will work like the chr$(15) / (CTRL-O), which puts many printers
into condensed mode.

In order to print the entire file, the proceedure it to press SHIFT-PRINT,
that is, hold down the SHIFT key and press the PRINT button at the same time.

Paul has given you an excellent description of what causes the problem, but
it's not "universal", some printers do it, some don't - it depends on how the
printer is configured, what command set it works with, etc.  But it __does__
happen with some printers, notably those that are Epson-compatible.

The solution is to not print the LCD screen, but download one of the print
formatter programs from the libraries here and use that program to print
instead.  It will get around the compressed print problem.
