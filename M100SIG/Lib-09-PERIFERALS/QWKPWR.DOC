		                  QWKPWR.100
                 A POWR-DOS menu program for the 100/102
-
     QWKPWR is a BASIC, cursor file select utility for operating POWR-DOS that 
is 1/4 the size of DMENU.BA (only 751 bytes) with the speed and "feel" of a .CO
program (3 times as fast as DMENU.BA). It doesn't use any RAM other than it's 
own living space and doesn't need any extra RAM files for temp storage: and it 
does NOT require ANY file name typing!
     It saves and loads RAM or DISK files; it will erase DISK files; it prompts
for and will append or overwrite existing DISK or RAM files; and it will run 
.BA or .CO (if you've CLEARed RAM beforehand) programs from DISK. It will also 
let you "Preview" the first 240 bytes of .DO files and will print a list of 
DISK files.
     To keep size to a minimum, QWKPWR doesn't KILL RAM files, won't overwrite 
RAM .BA files, won't RUN RAM files, won't auto-CLEAR .CO running space (except 
as noted below), and won't multiple-load files. (Hey, it's only 751 bytes!)
-
     Download QWKPWR.DOC (this file), and QWKPWR.100 as .DO files. Checksum 
QWKPWR.DO and LOAD and SAVE a .BA version. (POWR-DOS must be installed of 
course.)
-
     Selection of QWKPWR from the main menu will set all the POWR-DOS "hooks" 
and display it's mini-menu. Use either UPPER or lower case letters.
-
          R displays visible RAM files and sizes
          D displays DISK files and sizes
          L will Lprint a list of the DISK's files and sizes. (Be sure a 
printer is connected and ready.)
          F shows free RAM and DISK space 
          M returns to the computer MENU
-
     NOTE: There is no error trapping except for printing the error and line 
number, but that will happen "softly" and won't trash files first if you 
carefully manage RAM and DISK space. Use the "F" key at the entry menu often. 
Because of QWKPWR's size and speed, it IS possible to loose a file if you try 
to append more info to a DISK .DO file than DISK space available or if you 
ERASE a DISK file before you're certain of a good RAM load or vice-versa. These
potential problems are certainly not unique to QWKPWR, but all the error 
checking needed for every possible contingency produces DMENU.BA: a fine 
program, but ponderous in every-day use compared to QWKPWR.
-
 To SAVE a file from RAM to DISK:
     Press R. You will see your visible RAM files display 7 at a time. Use the 
Spacebar to page through your files. (If you decide NOT to save any RAM files 
then just keep pressing the Spacebar to restart QWKPWR.) After the page with 
the file you want to save to DISK displays, press SHIFT/BREAK. This will put a 
<R next to the top entry (R for RAM). Now use the Spacebar to select the file 
to be SAVEd to DISK: press <ENTER> (or ESC to re-run). If this is a new file to
your DISK you will then see a >D to tell you the SAVE is taking place. If the 
file already exists on your DISK you will be prompted O/A/M? Press O to 
Overwrite the existing file or A to Append (.DO files ONLY). You will then see 
a O>D or A>D, the SAVE will take place and QWKPWR restarts.
-
 To LOAD a file from DISK to RAM:
     Press D. You will see your DISK files display 7 at a time. Use the 
Spacebar to page through your files. (If you decide NOT to load any DISK files 
then just keep pressing the Spacebar to restart QWKPWR.) After the page with 
the file you want to load to RAM displays, press SHIFT/BREAK. This will put a <
D next to the top entry (D for DISK). Now use the Spacebar to select the file 
to be LOADed to RAM: press <ENTER> (or ESC to re-run). You will now be asked  L
/R/E/P/M? 
          L will try to LOAD the file. If RAM is clear of a file by that name 
then you will see >R signifying that the file is being LOADed. If the file 
already exists in RAM you will be prompted O/M? Press O to Overwrite ONLY 
existing RAM .CO or .DO files. You will then see O>R or A>R to tell you the 
LOAD is taking place. (QWKPWR won't overwrite RAM .BA files but will BEEP, 
display R/.BA, and END. YOU must first kill or re-name the RAM .BA file and re-
run QWKPWR.) QWKPWR will restart after loading .DO or .CO files but a .BA file 
will require you to re-run QWKPWR manually.
          R will run .BA and .BA/.DO files directly from your DISK.  CO files 
can also be run from DISK if running space has been CLEARed before using 
QWKPWR. You can also add CLEAR code to line 1 of QWKPWR to CLEARXXX,XXXXX for 
any regularly used HIMEM value.
          E will ERASE the selected DISK file after prompting for confirmation.
Answer Y to continue: any other key will abort and re-run QWKPWR.
          P lets you "preview" the first 240 bytes of a .DO file and then re-
displays the mini-menu.
          M returns to QWKPWR's mini-menu.

     I am indebted to Wilson Van Alst for byte-fighting my original 800+ byte 
version down to it's present 751 byte fightin' trim and for careful editing of 
my original ideas. I have found QWKPWR to be fast, smooth and accurate. The 
original design objective was "do everything in 800 bytes or less". I run an 
invisible version from F7, set up with the following code: KEY7,"DSK"+CHR$(24)+
"RUN"+CHR$(34)+"QWKPWR"+CHR$(13). 
     The only M/L call used is "scroll-off". Occasionaly the SHIFT/BREAK 
routine will cause a "BREAK IN LINE..." error 18, (I'm not certain why), but 
just type CONT <ENTER> or re-run QWKPWR. If you don't like the BEEP you can 
delete it from the beginning of line 1.

QWKSAV.BA

     Instead of uploading the following code as a separate program I've 
included it here as a "bonus". I use it regularly to back-up a RAM-full of 
files to a buffer disk from time to time just in case... Checksum as a .DO file
is 17,755 and it takes just 178 bytes as a stand-alone .BA. It probably arrived
with Cr's as part of this .DOC but EDIT them to leave only FOUR lines of code 
0, 2, 4 & 6.

     When you run it from the main menu it will save to disk all active RAM 
files, visible or not, and automatically overwrite any from a previous back-up 
with the same name. It won't save any files whose extension doesn't begin with 
B, C, or D so "powr-dos" and RAM files without extensions will be bypassed.

     I hope you find QWKPWR and QWKSAV as useful as I have. QWKPWR would be 
smaller as a CO program but there are some operational advantages to a 
"floating" .BA prgm. (Unless we could squeeze it into the ALT/LCD buffer.)
