Tandy Disk Drive Menu - Patches for Tandy 200 (revised 11/21/85)

  The program in TDDTIP.005 can be modified for the Tandy 200 in two ways - one 
gives an 8-line format (as on the Model 100, using the top half of the screen, 
and the other uses the full display. The two programs below will patch the DOS 
in high memory. Just run FLOPPY.CO as you normally would, key F8 (menu) from the
DOS menu and return to the main menu, and run either of the programs you have 
keyed in from below.

  At this point, from Basic, you can CALL 57500 to see if the new DOS menu is 
working as it should. If it is, then kill FLOPPY.CO. To save your patched DOS as
FLOPPY.CO (or whatever), enter Basic, and type:

SAVEM"FLOPPY.CO",57500,60918,57500

and press <enter>.  Wow! You now have a NEW version of FLOPPY.CO which you can 
save to disk. (This is much easier than the hand-modifying method referred to in
TDDTIP.005 - and besides, I don't know how to do it that way!) Keep this copy as
your working copy.

  I also recommend the 11-byte program in TDDTIP.001 as an alternative to 
keeping FLOPPY.CO in both high and low memory.

  I keep my modified FLOPPY.CO in one ram bank, and use the DISK.BA program to 
call the DOS in my other two banks.  With this method, I can use MSPLAN in the 
bank with FLOPPY.CO, and not have to worry about corrupting the DOS (and, it 
seems to work fine with sheets I've created AFTER loading the DOS and setting 
HIMEM to 57500!). Of course, I only have about 12 K for worksheets, but you 
can't have everything...

  To change the position of the starting line (Disk File Manager...), change 
Line 20 to:

20 A$=CHR$(10)+" Disk File Manager  V.01.00.01"+CHR$(13)+STRING$(14,CHR$(10))+
"File Load Save Bkup Kill Name Frmt Menu"+STRING$(60,CHR$(0))

This will change the checksum of the second program listed above to 37663.  I 
tried this because I don't like the label stuck up in the upper-left corner of 
the screen.  You can make any changes you wish in the A$ string as long as you 
don't change the total length - this string goes into the addresses from 57719 
to 57856, and other screen messages begin IMMEDIATELY thereafter.  If you 
overwrite those messages, there just MAY be problems...

  After disassembling the DOS to find the addresses for these routines in the 
200, I've come to the conclusion that Tandy DID NOT come up with relocatable 
code for these routines - FLOPPY_SYS on the Utility disk is so large because it 
has BOTH routines and TWO loaders in it - one for the M100 and one for the T200!
Of course, I could be wrong here, but the difference in addresses of the 
routines and the differences in the ROM addresses being CALLed would seem to 
preclude the DOS being in relocatable code for each system.

  Feel free to use and expand on these.
