This program restores the "normal" Power-Disk program by reloading and running
it from POWR-D.CO on disk.

Since it access the disk, it assumes that you already have a version of the
DOS loaded, presumably a relocated version at another address.

So essentially, what this program does, is to kill a relocated version of
Power-Disk, and reloads a "normal" version at the default address just below
system maxram.
