CAUTION: Read through this entire section at least once before proceeding. You
may save yourself time and trouble.  In this manual, material in UPPER CASE
letters indicates something you type into the computer; <ENTER> means pressing
the ENTER key; and function keys are shows as [F1], [F2], etc.

If you have never used a disk drive before, you may want to read Appendix A,
which explains some basic concepts of the Tandy portable disk drive. You may
want to skim over this appendix in any case.

[Instructions are for loading from the original Utility disk. Forum users can
skip down to "Notes for the Expert User" section. - ed.]

POWR-DISK is a supplement to FLOPPY.CO. In order to load POWR-DISK, you must
use FLOPPY.CO to get started.  Here is the simplest way:

1.  Run FLOPPY.CO.  If you haven't loaded FLOPPY, follow the directions given
    with the Tandy Portable Disk Drive (called TDD in this manual.)

2.  Press [F2], "Load".  Answer the prompt, "File name on disk:" with
    POWR-D.CO <ENTER>.  Press ENTER again, after the prompt, "File name in
    RAM".

3.  Press [F2] again.  This time, load in the file, START.BA from the disk.

4.  Press [F8] to exit FLOPPY.CO.

5.  Run START.BA. When it finishes, POWR-DISK is operational and MENU.BA is
    available for your use.

Notes for the Expert User:

This section describes the startup procedure in more technical terms.  The
POWR-DISK code comes packaged in [an assembly language] file, POWR-D.CO.  The
file loads into the area directly below the computer's default MAXRAM (system
memory boundary).  Running it changes some RAM hooks to add extra functionality
to BASIC and TEXT.  In addition, MAXRAM itself gets lowered to protect the
POWR-DISK code from accidental clears.  So, once POWR-D.CO has been run, the
file itself can be removed from memory without danger.

								Manual Page 2
								-------------

The program START.BA simply runs POWR-D.CO, deletes the [menu] file, sets
HIMEM to the new MAXRAM, loads MENU.BA from the disk, and removes FLOPPY.CO
from memory.  Errors can occur in START.BA if FLOPPY.CO does not exist, etc.,
but once POWR-D.CO has been run, POWR-DISK is safely in place.

If you are working in an environment with frequent cold-starts (such as
assembly language development), it is wise to keep a copy of POWR-D.CO on
cassette tape, where it can be reloaded more easily than using dip switches,
IPL.BA, etc.  It may seem ironic, but the cassette is supported in the ROM, so
support for it won't evaporate with a cold-start.
POWR-DISK Owner's Manual

Removing POWR-DISK

You will have only infrequent occasions to remove POWR-DISK.  With the
relocation techniques discussed in Section Five, you can leave POWR-DISK active
virtually all the time.  However, if you ever want to remove it, use the
following BASIC command:

	LFILES OFF : CLEAR 0, MAXRAM : MENU <ENTER>

Be certain that you can restore POWR-DISK before you disable it.  (The simplest
way to be sure is to have POWR-D.CO and START.BA in RAM before doing the LFILES
OFF.)  Otherwise, you may be forced to start from the very beginning and load
FLOPPY.CO from your Tandy Utility Diskette.

[Forum versions of the two necessary files, START.BA and POWR-D.CO (in hex
format) may be downloaded from the forum's library whenever needed; the hex
file converted with HXFER.200, and you're ready to load.  Both START.BA and
POWR-D.CO are contained in the single file, PDSK03.200 in Library 9. - ed.]

				 Section Two
				Using MENU.BA

MENU.BA is a utility program, written in BASIC, to simplify file transfers to
and from the TDD.  You can get by without MENU.BA; POWR-DISK allows you to save
and retrieve files from the TDD in BASIC or TEXT.  However, MENU.BA allows you
to examine the disk and RAM contents and to move files back and forth without
typing filenames.

[One problem with all menu-type programs is that they consume RAM space; it is
recommended that users learn to use direct commands to access disk functions,
and use menu-type programs only when needed, not as a regular practice. - ed.]

To run MENU.BA, simply put the wide cursor bar over it from the main menu, and
press <ENTER>.  After a few seconds, a display similar to the one below will
appear:
