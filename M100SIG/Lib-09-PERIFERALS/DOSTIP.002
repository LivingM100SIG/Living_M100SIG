Another solution to "How do I use Powr-DOS to load SUPERA or 0MENU below
P-DOS?"  I think this is easier to use than Don's:

** Use the IPL program to load TINY.

** Remove the disk; turn off TDD; flip the DIP switches; turn on TDD; put the
disk back in.

** Use TINY to load MENU1/SUPERA, PL, & anything else you think you need.

** Use PL to load Powr-DOS.

I then use MENU1 to get me to Bank 2, where I just load TINY, then MENU2;
similarly, Bank 3.  Then I use the copy of Powr-DOS in 1 to capture anything I
need from disk, and transfer as needed to the other banks with 0MENU.

Guess this shows there's more than one
solution to most problems.
