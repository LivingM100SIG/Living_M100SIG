Documentation for CBACK.100

This utility will make backup copies of your Chipmunk disks. It requires you to
swap disks between 20 and 80 times depending on the amount of free RAM 
available. The minimum amount of free RAM needed is approximately 5100 bytes. 
The more free RAM, the faster the process. It makes an exact duplicate of the 
disk.

Before you can make a backup copy you MUST format the destination disk.

The program starts by telling you how many times you will have to swap disks 
and ask you if you want to proceed. To continue press Y, to stop press N. If 
you proceed, the screen will clear and prompt you with:
     Insert  SOURCE  disk. <ENTER>
Put the disk you wish to make a copy of into the drive and press ENTER. The 
screen will show you that it is reading the disk and tell you what track and 
sector it is reading. The screen will then clear and prompt you with:
     Insert  DESTINATION  disk. <ENTER>
Remove the SOURCE disk from the drive and put in the destination disk and press
ENTER. The program will continue in this fashion until the backup is complete.

This program will work equally well with the DVI if you change the 80 at the 
end of line 3 to 40 and change the 79 in line 7 to 39. If you have questions/
problems just contact me on this SIG.
