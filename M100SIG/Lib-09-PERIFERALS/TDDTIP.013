BOOTING TDD WITH ULTIMATE ROM II
--------------------------------

If you own UR-2 but not TS-DOS you may have assumed that the TS-
DOS menu option is useless to you.  NOT true!  You can save FLOPPY
or DSKPWR (DL5) to disks with the name DOS100.CO and then use that
menu option to boot the DOS into the M100, without having to mess 
with the DIP switches.  This is the most convenient way to boot 
the TDD that I know of (from ROM) and comes close to the 
convenience of the Chipmunk in recovering from a cold start.  All 
you have to do first is go to Basic and 'CALL63013,1' to get 
Ultimate ROM II going.
