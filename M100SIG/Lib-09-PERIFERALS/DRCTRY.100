      Tape Management Made Easy!

=======================================

(D)IRECTORY.100 is a reliable system for effective cassette tape management. 
I've used the system for more than two years now and I swear it's "goof-proof"!


(D)IRECTORY's simple and it really works. At first, it takes a modest measure 
of discipline but it soon becomes second nature. With it, I happily wrangle a 
library of over a hundred "C-20" static archive and "volatile" text and data 
tapes. And the library keeps growing!

I have re-edited (D)IRECTORY to clear up a few typos in the 1984 version (1.0) 
and to make the file compatable with my new version of FXTXT.100 (vidtext 
carriage return stripper) recently uploaded to DL 0 (02/10/86).

This file now contains various "dot commands". After downloading, process the 
file with FXTXT.100 (3.0) and the file will be ready for printing with WRITE+ (
or SCRIPSIT) with all paragraph breaks and list formats intact.


.X1
Step 1:
-------
.X2


Use only long, leaderless, cassettes - the "C-20" size are ideal. With (D)
IRECTORY, there's no reason to use short tapes. They only cost more and take-up
more room per data stored.

Also, put away pencil and paper. You need simple cassette lables but gone for 
good are those scrapy (and usually out of date!) hard-copy tape logs.


.X1
Step 2:
-------
.X2


Store the contents of "Appendix" (see below) in RAM under a suitable file name 
(I use "TAPE").

Keep this file permanently in RAM for future use!


.X1
Step 3:
-------
.X2


Open another RAM file and name it "D". Leave this file empty for now. It will 
become a "workspace" in Step 4.


.X1
Step 4:
-------
.X2


You are now ready to manage your first tape!

In RAM, paste a copy of "TAPE" into "D". In "D", enter the appropriate 
information under the headings. You will note that "(D)rctry" is already listed
as a file starting at cue 0, and that cue 15 is where your first recorded file 
will start. DO NOT ALTER THESE ENTRIES!

To make entry of heading information easy, prompts are provided. To use, press 
<F-1>, then a ".", and then <ENTER>. The cursor will be at "Tape title:". To 
reach "Tape No.:", press <F-1>, then <ENTER>. And so on.

When finished, exit "D".


.X1
Step 5:
-------
.X2


Rewind the tape and set the counter (cue) at 0. Fast-forward the tape to 
counter 15 - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!

Sarting at counter (cue) 15, record (save) your first file.

After file is saved, enter "D" and move cursor to bottom (one "tab" to right of
cue 15). Enter name of file just recorded plus other info (if you wish) on this
line. Then press <ENTER> and type the number (cue) currently on the counter. 
Then press <TAB> and exit "D".

Repeat this step for each new file recorded during this session. As you can 
see, each new file starts at the cue number marking the end of the previous 
file.


.X1
Step 6:
-------
.X2


At the end of session, rewind the tape to 0. Record (save) "D", entering the 
name "D" when prompted by "Save to:". For safety, record twice: there's plenty 
of room unless "D" is excessively long. DO NOT RECORD PAST COUNTER (CUE) 15 OR 
YOU WILL DESTROY YOUR OTHER FILES!

After you finish, errase (F-6) the contents of "D" (you could kill "D" if you 
wish but I find it convenient to leave "D" in place as an empty file).


.X1
Step 7:
-------
.X2


That's all there is to it!

The next time you access the tape, rewind, set the counter at 0, and load "D" (
into "D", of course!). Update "D" as required during the session. When you 
finish, follow Step 6. The updated "D" will record over the old "D".

Remember "TAPE" in RAM? Always copy from "TAPE" to "D" when starting a new 
directory (Step 4).

Some Hints:
-----------
.X2


- Develop a rational tape classification system. I use a title (like "Resumes")
, and a letter-number (like "R-1" for Tape No. 1 of "Resumes" series). Account 
or job numbers can also be used.

- Remember to label your tapes (I use "Avery" sticky-backs - easy to remove!). 
Just the tape title, tape number, and side number are needed. Use one label for
each side and one on the case.

- If you forget to label a tape, all is not lost! Remember, the directory is 
always called "D". Just load "D" to find out the tape name, number, side, and 
contents.

- "D" is called "D" for a reason. Since the directory is loaded and saved at 
least once during each tape session, a single letter name makes keying these 
operations a cinch. Also "D" is easy to remember!

- The tape counter is everything! Always rewind the tape and reset the counter 
to 0 before starting a session. NEVER RESET THE COUNTER DURING A SESSION.

- (D)IRECTORY makes it very easy to record over old files while conserving 
tape. Pick an old file (or series of old files) that is longer than the new 
file. Cue the tape to the start of the old file. Record the new file. When 
finished, note the end-of-file cue number and update "D" accordingly. 
Naturally, any old files that start at higher cue numbers will remain on tape 
and noted in "D".

If the new end-of-file falls short of the start of the next old file, note the 
difference as per the following example:


.X1
1. Before:

00      (D)rctry
15      OLDFL1
25      OLDFL2
30      OLDFL3
40      OLDFL4
52      

2. Record "NEWFL" starting at 25 and ending at 33:

00      (D)rctry
15      OLDFL1
25      NEWFL
33      (eof)
40      OLDFL4
52      


.X2
Now you know that if you ever wish to record over "OLDFL4", you can start at 33
instead of 40!

Finally...

.X2


So there it is. Still haven't bought that Chipmunk yet, eh? Don't let (D)
IRECTORY stop you! Disks really are easier, believe me!!
