TINY.PWR (one of the POWR-DOS files) is a *very small* file transfer utility
for the Model 100/Tandy 102 and the TDD/TDD2.  IT DOES *NOT* REQUIRE POWR-DOS
OR ANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEM.  If that's what you need, this is the program
you need.  TINY has only four commands -- LOAD, SAVE, KILL, & QUIT -- and
isn't very friendly.  But it doesn't waste any bytes on features you don't
intend to use.

The advantage, of course, is that nearly all of your RAM remains available for
other applications.

One shortcoming:  Like all TDD1 "DOSses", TINY can only read the directory for
Bank 0.  But if you need this program, that shouldn't be a problem.

Although TINY was released by Acroatix with Powr-DOS, it is *not* really part
of Powr-DOS and deserves a separate discussion.  This file contains that
discussion.  Mostly, though, this file contains those excerpts from the
Powr-DOS manual which pertain to TINY....


Everything which follows, except for inserted comments, is direct from the
manual:
                                   ===========
                                   USING TINY

POWR-DOS takes up about 3,000 bytes; the loading process needs about 7,000
bytes to work successfully.  In anticipation of possible memory problems, we
provide TINY, a program which gives you access to the PDD using 800 bytes of
memory [depends upon your loading procedure. joel].  TINY has limited
functions; you will probably want to use it only when you load and save files
too large to fit into RAM with POWR-DOS.

      [TINY.PWR is a HIMEM-occupying machine-language program; if you convert
      it using HXFER you can treat it like any other such program.  I've
      skipped the loading instructions from the manual; use the following
      instead:
      
      Remove any M/L programs above HIMEM.
      
      Type CLEAR0,62200 to reset HIMEM.
      
      Go to MENU.
      
      Move the widebar cursor to TINY.CO.
      
      Press <ENTER>.
      
      --Other loading routines are possible, if you understand them.  See
      FLIPML.DOC in DL7 for a lengthy discussion.]
      
[Resuming:]  The TINY prompt appears as follows:

> C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
>

The prompt is designed to remind you of TINY's functions.  "C" stands for
command (one of K, L, S, or Q), and the F's and X's help line up file names. 
All TINY commands consist of a single letter, which stands for one of four
commands:

*L for Loading from disk;

*S for Saving to disk;

*K for Killing a disk file; and

*Q for Quitting the program.

All commands require a file name.  (Even "Q" may not work unless you enter a
file name.)  The file name must line up with the F's and X's on the prompt. 
So, for instance, to save a file named MEMO.DO to the disk, enter the following
command:

> C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
> S MEMO  .DO<Enter>

Neither (L)oad nor (S)ave will overwrite an existing file.  If you try to
overwrite a file either in RAM or on disk, you will get an "AE" (already
exists) error.  If you are (S)aving to disk, use TINY to (K)ill the old disk
file first, then try (S)aving i
t again.  If you are (L)oading a RAM file and you get an AE error, you must
(Q)uit TINY, kill the RAM file, then run TINY again to (L)oad the file.

As you can see, TINY is a "no-frills" program.  It does have one convenience,
however; it remembers the last file name you typed.  This can come in handy
when overwriting files.  For example, if you wanted to replace MEMO.DO on the
disk, with the MEMO.DO 
in RAM, you could use the following sequence:

> C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
> S MEMO  .DO
AE err
> C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
> K<Enter>
> C FFFFFF.XX (C=KLSQ)
> S<Enter>


                                 ERRORS IN TINY
TINY gives disk error codes corresponding to POWR-DOS codes.
[these are the "new" codes:]
       NR	59	RS232 Not Ready for Disk Access
       DN	60	Drive not Responding
       CM	61	Communications Error
       DA	62	Drive Done Early
       WP	63	Disk is Write Protected
       DF	64	Disk is Full
       ND	65	No Disk in Drive
       HT	66	Miscellaneous Drive Trouble
       AE	67	File already exists; can't overwrite
                                   ==========
That's complete documentation for the program.  I'm certain I'm not the only
person who's found it useful.
