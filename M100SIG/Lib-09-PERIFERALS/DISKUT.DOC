DISKUT.DOC          [ DOCUMENTATION FOR DISKUT.DVI ]
This program was written after trashing disks that I had been using for school.
After looking around I couldn't find what I needed so I turned to the 
Disk/Video Interface for help.  In the manual I found out how the directory was
organized.  Values for unused clusters are a decimal 255 and a decimal 254 for
clusters that are damaged or secured such as the System Tracks.   By writing
254's to a certain track it can be protected for such use as directory protec-
ion.  If you write 255's to the System Track entry in the directory you
efectively open up 9K more of disk space.  Thus by using this program you can
not only protect the directory with a backup of it but you can get about 4K
more of disk space or 9K more of disk space by not using the protection part
of the program.   For disks who's directory has physical damage you first must
make a backup using the backup program that came with the DVI, then use this
program to copy the directory back to track #20 from track #39.   Track #39
was chosen because of the way the disk is usually written to.   The disk starts
in the middle and works it's way outward.   The program can be split into
two individual programs.   Enjoy   Keith Richmond [73127,1727].
