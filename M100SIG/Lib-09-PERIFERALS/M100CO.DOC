     This program allows a model 100 computer to use an IBM/compatible
computer as a disk drive. The model 100 must use a DOS like TS-DOS
or Powr-Disk. The IBM computer must have a serial port and a null
modem cable.

     To start the program type in M100COM. The program will default
to COM1 and use whatever directory you are in as the storage area.
Once the program has started you may change to another directory
or disk drive with the F9 key. To end the program use the F10 key.
If you want to use COM2 then start the program by typing in the
following command line- M100COM /COM2.

     In some situations PC's and AT's running at less than 8mhz
cannot keep up with data coming from the Model 100 at 19200 baud.
It is possible to slow the baud rate down to 9600 by starting the
program with the command line- M100COM /9600. If you need to switch
after the program has started you can toggle the rate with the
F8 key. This feature will only work if the Model 100 DOS can also
switch to the slower rate. TS-DOS will do this automatically.

     The program was compiled using Quick Basic 4.0 and the source
code is provided.
