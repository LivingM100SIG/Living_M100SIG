This file describes converting BACKRD.100, a program for the 100/102, so it
will run in a 200, allowing the user to backup all files in a 256K Node RAMdisk
to a PC clone, using M100CO.EXE in the PC to simulate a TDD (Tandy Portable
Disk Drive). It results in a fast, automatic way to backup all Node files to a
PC, requiring only minutes to copy all files to a PC disk.

Required:  Copies of BACKRD.100 (Lib 9)  (DOC's in file)

		     HXFER.200  (Lib 10) (and HXFER.DOC)

		     PDSK03.200 (Lib 10) (Read Power-Disk Manual in PDSK02.200
		     if you plan to use Power-Disk regularly)

		     M100CO.EXE (Lib 9)  (and M100CO.DOC) (download into PC)

Are there any files in the LIBs which will allow me to backup a Node Datapack
to my IBM-clone hard drive? The Node is on a Model 200.

The program BACKRD.100 in Library 9 (DOCs are in the file) will backup files
in a Node Datapak to a TDD disk, using Power-DOS in the computer.  The program
M100CO.EXE (Read M100CO.DOC), also in Library 9 will make a PC think it's a
TDD.

BACKRD should run in a 200, using Power-Disk, but may require some changes. If
it doesn't work, let me know and I'll explore.

I just looked at BACKRD, and it's 100-specific, will need to be modified to
run in a 200.  Can you do that, or do you need help on it?


Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

Thanks very kindly for the offer, Tony. What I'm looking for is something like
PCXFER, which will allow me to pump files from the 200 into the desktop
without stopping at a TDD. I'm going to try PCXFER later today; it's always
worked for me with the 100, and I think all I'll have to do is change the
STATs.


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

I guess I didn't explain it clearly enough... there is no TDD involved.  You
don't even have to own one.  The BACKRD program, along with Power-DOS/Disk
saves data out the RS-232 port _as_if_ it were going to a TDD.

Meanwhile M100CO is running in the PC, which is attached to the RS-232 port,
and the PC _thinks_ it's a TDD.  So when the backup program runs, it saves
files from the Node datapak to the PC, which saves them on disk.

I think PCXFER requires you to manually save files from RAM to the PC... the
implication is that it's a "transfer" program.  You'd have to move files from
the Node into RAM, then on to the PC, all manually.  The BACKRD/M100CO process
would be all automatic.

Sonuvagun! That's what I want to do, all right.

Meanwhile, I've made some progress on another approach. I have the 200 and the
desktop connected through a null modem cable, and by running Procomm on the
desktop and Telcom on the 200 I've got them swapping files. However, any file
I want to send from the 200 to Procomm has to be in main Ram, not the Node. Is
there anything in the LIBS that lets Telcom or something like it run in the
Ramdisk? Maybe SXM?

(I should have thought of Procomm/Telcom sooner...sorry to bug you with it
before I thought it through!)


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

Yeah... well, that's always worked; but it's not what you originally asked
for. And it involves a lot more work.

I've never had any success in running programs directly from the Node, and to
the best of my knowledge no one has developed any other program that would do
what you propose, because such programs do not actually run _IN_ the Node...
they are moved into RAM to run, so they have access to the operating system.
When you edit a file "in the Node", you're actually in RAM under control of
the RAMdisk's ROM.  If there is not enough room in RAM to edit a file, or run
a program, it doesn't open or run.

Anyway, whatever works.

I had a sneaking suspicion that was the case. Oh, well, I'll just move the
files into RAM and use TELCOM to pop 'em onto the hard drive. 9600 baud seems
to give errors, but 4800 works perfectly, and I can't read at 9600 baud anyway
(grin).

Thanks for the help, Tony. I think I'm gonna love this Node...it's a real
trip, after writing five books on a 100, to have the WHOLE working manuscript
of the next one in memory at once! I haven't gotten this excited since I got
my Chipmunk.


Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062 

Tony, I'd like to give BACKRD a try. Would it be too much trouble to ask you
to modify it to run on the 200? It's beyond me.

Meanwhile, I'll get POWR-DISK for the 200 (LIB 10, right?) and M100CO. Thanks!


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

Power-Disk and M100CO are in Library 9.  For Power-Disk, you only need three
files to get it running, instructions, loader and data file.  Start by reading
the instructions in PDSK01.200, and get the files that are recommended there.

M100CO.EXE should be downloaded into your PC.  M100CO.DOC contains the
instructions.

To use BACKRD in the 200, download it, and remove CALL17001: from line 9.  It
serves no real purpose in the program, only making screen display in reverse
video, but is machine specific.

Change 63013 in Line 11 to 61162.

Change -87 in Line 23 to -737.

Change -86 in Line 23 to -738.

Change -86 in Line 24 to -738.

The program should now run in the 200, since those are the addresses that make
the program machine-specific, and you've just changed them to the addresses in
the 200.

Now that I've looked at some of the Powr-D files, I have a couple of
questions. (you guessed, right?)

The POWR-D.INF file says that no one's running it on a 200. Hmm? I trust that
this is obsolete information.

Could TINY.PWR do the same job, since all I'll be using it for is the BACKRD
program?


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

No, you're in the wrong files.... you've located Power-DOS for the 100/102.
You want Power-Disk, which is for the 200, and starts with the file
PDSK01.200.

TINY will not work in the 200, since it is part of the Power-DOS series.


Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

Many thanks, Tony! Would you like me to upload a copy of BACKRD to LIB 10 when
I get it modified and working?


Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062 (X)

My brain is flowing out of my ears, and I haven't gotten BACKRD running yet.
Let me see if I can tell you what I've done, so you can tell me what I did
wrong.

I loaded Power-Disk by running the programs in PDSK03.200, converting the hex
file with HXFER.REL. I made the modifications to BACKRD and saved it in the
Node. Then, following the BACKRD instructions, I killed all files in main RAM,
went to BASIC and entered CALL 63013,1. Dumb move...that must be the call for
the 100. Arctic start.

SO, I reloaded Power-Disk. This time I tried CALL 61162,1 since the Node
instructions said 61167 was the address for BASIC calls for the 200. Lockup.

SO, I arctic started, reloaded everything, and tried CALL 61167,2. This got me
the Node menu. I started M100COM on the desktop and ran BACKRD. I got
"Communication error" on the desktop and "Error 18 in Line 22" on the 200.

That's where it stands right now. I think Power-Disk is still loaded, since
the bank shows 17446 bytes free and there's nothing in main RAM.

Next move, doctor?


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

Huh!  Well, you certainly have a problem there somewhere.  Let me try it all
myself, and see what happens.  I'll get back to you in the morning.


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

Well, I didn't duplicate your cold start... in fact, except for entering two
minor points, I followed the directions in the BACKRD file, and the program
ran as expected, and backed up stuff, as expected, with one minor glitch.

Your messages described in detail what you did to get the program running,
except for one step.  Did you use START.BA to load and hook Power-Disk into
the operating system?

Here's what I did, which you should be able to duplicate.  I selected a little
used bank in the 200 to experiment in.  I saved all files in the bank to disk.
Obviously that meant I already had Power-Disk operational in the bank.  So I
killed all files after saving, then removed Power-Disk with the command
LFILESOFF:CLEAR256,MAXRAM:MENU.  At this point, all I had in the bank was
RAMDSK on the main menu.  Through RAMDSK, I loaded START.BA and POWR-D.CO from
the Node, and ran START to load Power-D.

Then I transferred BACKRD from bank 1 into bank 2, and saved it to the Node.
BACKRD had already been edited as previously advised.

At this point, instead of killing RAMDSK and using a CALL to enter the Node's
menu, I went to the menu with RAMDSK, leaving it in memory.  Moved the cursor
over BACKRD, pressed the enter key, and away it went -- Saved the first file,
displayed "Ok" and "RUN9" and I pressed the ENTER key to save the next file.
That saved, displayed "Ok" and "RUN9" so I pressed ENTER to save the next
file. And so it goes....  I saved several files direct to disk, and since it
was working, aborted the test after about the sixth file.

The "glitch" I mentioned, is that you shouldn't have to press the ENTER key to
get each file to save... it should be automatic.  But that's a minor thing.
Also, I did not have M100CO running in the PC, I saved directly to TDD, since
my PC is not readily available here, and that part of it shouldn't matter,
unless there is some as-yet unreported problem with M100CO.

So try the above, and see if you duplicate my results.


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

I made some changes in lines 23 and 24 to fix that "glitch" I described.  If
you merge these lines into the BACKRD program it will run automatically, as it
should, so you don't have to press the ENTER key after every file, in order to
save the next file.

23 A="Run9"+CHR$(13):FORT=1TO5:POKE2*T+64797,ASC(MID$(A,T)):POKE2*T+64798,0
24 NEXT:POKE64798,5:KILLB:END

And, I let the program run to completion, to backup all the files in my Node
to disk.... took 3 disks (whew!).  But it ran flawlessly; to the TDD anyway.
Will try it with a PC tomorrow, after getting M100CO up and running, and will
let you know if that works as it should.

OK, I have now loaded and ran M100CO in a PC clone, and successfully backed up
Node files to the PC with BACKRD.

In the process I discovered your Error 18 in Line 22, and read about the cause
and cure in the file M100CO.THD.  It's caused by the PC when it is running at
too slow a speed to keep up with the incoming data from the portable at 19,200
baud.  The solution is to set your PC to run in "turbo mode", or at the
fastest clock speed possible.  I got the error 18 when the PC was running at
4.77 mhz, but not at 10 mhz.  At 10 mhz, BACKRD ran completely, backing up the
entire Node contents to a disk in the PC, and with the line 23-24 changes, ran
automatically, without operator intervention.  It seems to meet your needs
exactly.

One other thing I did find, some characters which are allowed in filenames in
the portables, are not allowed in filenames in the PC, and can cause a
filename error.  Specifically, you can have a filename in the portable which
includes a question mark; but you cannot have such a filename in the PC.  If
you have any files which contain non-alphanumeric characters, you should
rename them first with the Node's F2 button.

So, make the line 23-24 changes, run your PC at the fastest possible speed,
and try again.



Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

Wow....service beyond the call of duty! Hope it didn't keep you up all night.

I set the desktop into Turbo Mode and tried again. Same result...it loads the
first filename and gives a communications error. After reading M100CO.THD, I
suspect the problem may be with the desktop (oh, great...I'm even more
ignorant there than I am with the 200!). I didn't configure the thing, so I
don't know how many buffers there are or whether or not I have any TSRs
fouling up the works. I don't think so, since I run TAPCIS extensively and it
doesn't like TSRs either.

I'm going to fiddle with the desktop config at lunch today; the first thing
I'll try is increasing the number of buffers. Then I'll reread M100CO.THD and
see if anything else occurs to me. Like maybe wiggling the cable connectors.


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

Well, I have a TSR in the PC which does not appear to conflict with M100CO.
But perhaps you have something that does.

I believe my buffers are set at 20 -- I didn't configure this machine either,
so can't help you much there.

I suspect the clock speed in the PC isn't allowing the program to handle the
19.2K that the DOS uses to send data to the disk/PC.  I see that there has
been some work to change the baud rate, and it may be necessary to do
something similar in your case, although I didn't have theat problem.  That
will take some digging to find the baud rate in Power-Disk, I suspect.  It can
be reset in M100CO by a "switch", and in Power-DOS by a specific statement. 
But that statement doesn't work with Power-Disk I'm afraid.


Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

Yeah, I tried the slower baud rate option in M100CO. Nothing happened at all.

I'm going to ask the guy who configured my system about the clock speed and
seee what I can find out. Meanwhile, if there was a way to get Power-Disk to
send at tle lower baud rate, that would probably solve it. I don't have to
wring every bitof speed out of the system, after all.


Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

Off we go again. I tried kicking the PC into turbo mode, and ran BACKRD. It
transferred 128 bytes of the first file and gave me a communications error
(error 18 in line 22 again on the 200).

I checked my CONFIG.SYS file and saw that I have 20 buffers. Not that I know
from buffers, but I changed it to 30. No change.

Then I tried the poke to make Power-Disk run at 9600 baud (from the M100CO.THD
file), set M100CO to 9600, and ran BACKRD. The 200 screen showed that it had
begun transferring the first file, and everything froze; nothing ever showed
up on the PC. Tried that one both in turbo mode and normal.

Next I'm going to try reloading Power-Disk, on the off chance that I fouled it
up somewhere in all of this experimentation. Film at 11.


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

I don't think the poke to slow down the baud rate of Power-Disk that's shown
in the M100CO.THD file will work in the 200 version. -- The 200 version loads
between 58960 and 61103, much below the 61291 address given to poke. That
would put the address up in the reserved RAM area, and poking that
indiscriminently is liable to lead to all sorts of grief.  I'll have to go
looking for the equivalent address in the 200 version of Power-Disk.

PEEK(HIMEM+441) shows 195, not the 57 indicated in the M100CO.THD file, so
it's not the same routine at that location in the 200 version.

But I think slowing down Power-Disk to 9600 baud is the way to go in your
particular equipment combination.  I'm working on it...

That "Error 18" simply means the PC is not able to keep up with the 19.2K baud
rate that the portable is sending; and that's because the clock speed, or the
combination of interrupts, clock speed, and memory wait states isn't fast
enough to deal with the dataflow.  We have to 1) Speed up your PC, or 2) Slow
down the portable.  Working on the latter.


Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

That was just about what I was deciding too. I chatted with my expert, and he
says that short of a major hardware upgrade I'm not gonna speed up the PC.
Since M100CO has the 9600 baud option, that seems like the simplest way to go.
I'll be standing by...thanks!

Hope that poke I made doesn't foul things up! I'll cold start that bank just
in case and reinstall Power-Disk. Having the Node sure makes cold starts less
daunting; everything's still safe in that little box stuck underneath.


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062
To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

After loading Power-Disk, poking 56 to 59404 will change the output baud rate
to 9600 baud, without affecting anything else.  Then running M100CO in the PC
by typing:

M100CO /9600

at the DOS prompt will do it.  I ran a successful complete backup test at this
speed, and although slower, it works just as well as the faster 19.2K baud.
Should work for you, unless your PC is terribly non-compatible.

So the plan is, Load Power-Disk with the START.BA program, then go into BASIC
and type: POKE 59404,56 and press ENTER.  Then get M100CO running in the PC,
so it's ready to receive, and go into your Node and run BACKRD.

I also made some changes to line 22 of BACKRD, which makes a better screen
display.  When the program restarts, it leaves the "Ok, RUN9" displayed on the
screen from then on, so you can't be sure exactly what point you're at.
Changing the SPACE$(120) statement in line 22 to CHR$(27)"J" clears that off
each time while the program is actually saving.  If you want to make that
change, the line now looks like this:

22 PRINT@45,"Saving "C;CHR$(27)"J":SAVEMC

Let me know whether it works for you.



Fm: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041
To: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

Tried the poke. Still no luck. With 9600 set in M100CO nothing happens at all;
when I abort BACKRD I get the Error 18 in line 22 again. With M100CO set to
19200 baud I get a disk error on the 200 and communications error on the PC.
That's the only indication I have that the two machines are actually connected
(sigh). I've tried this in both turbo and normal mode, after reloading
Power-Disk, and in another bank in the 200.

I guess the problem is somewhere in my PC's clock speed or wait states, about
which I know nothing. I suppose I'm stuck with Procomm until I can get someone
to look at the PC.

Thanks anyway for all the effort...I HAVE learned a lot.

Well, I've just about exhausted suggestions, but here are two final ones....

1. Make sure you are using a null modem adapter somewhere in the line between
the 200 and the PC.

2. Make sure that pins 4 and 5 in the cable, or adapter, are shorted together
at the 200 end, and again at the PC's end, and do not connect to each other.
(no connection between 4 and 5 on the 200's end and 4 and 5 on the PC's end)

And if it still doesn't work, there's no where else I can go with it for you.
It works here, and if it doesn't work there, there's something causing it not
to work, and I don't know what. Sorry.

What brand/type of PC-clone do you have?  How much memory?  Does your cable
connect to COM port 1 or COM port 2?  May be that M100CO uses only one port...
but which one?  Works in COM 1 on mine.

Doug you may need to change the UART for the serial port on the PC. There have
been a lot of complaints by those PC owners with 9600 and 19200 modems that
they have nothing but trouble. The culprit has been an older style UART that
doesn't keep up with the data flow at those speeds. It overflows the buffers.
Check on the IBMCOM forum and ask around, I'm sure they can direct you to the
correct UART. BTW whenever I used M100Co in the past I ALWAYS had to use COM
1, it would not work on COM 2 of any of my machines, don't have the slightest
idea why. BTW glad to see you're having "fun" with your new toy.

The null modem adapter is a Radio Shack standard, and it works with Procomm
talking to TELCOM, so I kinda doubt that it's the problem.

I have been attempting to use COM2. M100CO has a switch for it; you boot the
program by typing M100CO /COM2. Again, it works with Procomm. I think I'll try
to figure out how to get into COM1; that's Gerry Lindsay's suggestion. Maybe
this thing just doesn't like to use COM2.

It's an ARC Turbo from American Research, 640K and 50 meg hard drive.

Please don't apologise...you've been very helpful through the whole thing! I
have had much worse help from paid consultants.

Sonuvagun. I've been using COM2, since the modem is on COM1. I'm not even sure
how to switch it, since I have an internal modem. I'll tinker. Thanks!

To: Doug Pratt (ModelNet) 76703,3041

Aha!  And there it is in the second paragraph of the M100CO.DOC file... The
program defaults to use COM1.  If you need to use it on COM2, then add the
switch /COM2 on the command line when you execute the program.

So at the DOS prompt, you'd type:

M100CO /9600 /COM2
