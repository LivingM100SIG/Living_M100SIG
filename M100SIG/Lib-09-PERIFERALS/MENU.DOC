These programs are file transfer utilities for use with a Model 100, Acroatix'
Powr-Disk and/or Powr-DOS, and the Tandy Portable Disk Drive.

Much as I like Powr-Disk/DOS, it's a pain to go to BASIC to transfer files to
and from a disk.  And I can't afford 3+ K for a utility program, however well
done.  These programs address these matters; all are simple file transfer
utilities without frills and with reasonable error traps.  MENU.jr (".jr", by
me) is around 600 bytes, and meets minimal requirements.  .jr runs with either
Powr-Disk or Powr-DOS.  MENU.jr2 (".jr2", also by me) is just under 1K and adds
several functions to .jr.  It runs ONLY with Powr-DOS, however.  PDMENU.TDD
("PDM", by Woods Martin [70235,232]) is the largest of these, and also adds
several features to .jr.  While PDM works only with Powr-Disk, adapting it to
run with P-DOS should not be terribly difficult.



Operation:
----------

These programs are function key driven.

<F-1> (DDir or Ddir) makes a call to LFILES.  Write options (you'll get a
prompt):  "LPT:" will write the directory to your printer; <ENTER> will dump it
to your screen; a legal filename will become a .DO file's name, into which
LFILES will place the catalogue.

<F-2> (Load) prompts for a filename to load from the disk drive.

<F-3> (Save) prompts for a filename to save to disk.

<F-4> (Apnd) [.jr2 only] prompts for a filename to append to a disk file.  The
name in RAM must match the disk file's name.
<F-4> (Dlen) [PDM only] prompts for a disk filename and returns the file's
length.

<F-5> (Erase, Del or Dkil) prompts for a filename to delete from the disk.

<F-6> (Free) [.jr2 only] reports sectors free available on disk.
<F-6> (Fmat) [PDM only] formats the disk in the drive.  If the disk contains
data, PDM prompts to verify that you actually wish to format it.

<F-7> (Rkil) [PDM only] prompts for a filename to delete from RAM.

<F-8> (Menu) returns to the Model 100 menu.


<ENTER> escapes to M100's menu from the program's main screen, and to the main
screen from any "File?" prompt (except "Dir to File?" in PDM).

Errors:
-------

Errors 55 (Bad File Name) and 52 (File Not Found) are trapped by .jr and .jr2
to BEEP and return directly to the previous prompt; the assumption's that all
such errors are unintended (probably typing) and that you'll wish to try again.
These are trapped by PDM to print "File Error <ENTER>?", as are attempts to
overwrite PDM; <ENTER> returns you to the previous prompt.

Error 67 (Already Exists) gains a BEEP from .jr and the message "Already
Exists <ENTER>?"; <ENTER> returns you to .jr's main screen.  PDM and .jr2
inquire whether you wish to overwrite the file, and continue on the basis of
your response; ultimately, you return to the previous prompt.

Errors 63 (Write Protected), 64 (Disk Full), and 65 (No Disk) bring BEEP and
"Disk Error <ENTER>?"; .jr & .jr2 return you to the main program screen, PDM
returns you to the previous prompt.

Errors 59 (Drive Not Ready), 60 (Drive Not Responding), 61 (Communications
Error), 62 (Drive Done Early [actually a file error, but shouldn't occur]), and
66 (Hard Trouble) yield BEEP and "Drive Error <ENTER>?"; .jr & .jr2 again
return to the program's main menu, PDM to the previous prompt.

Most other errors in .jr or .jr2 result in the familiar "Error xx in line xxx
<ENTER>?"  PDM restarts the program on any error it doesn't trap.


Notes:
------

These are three versions of the same program; Woods and I worked on them
simultaneously and borrowed each others' code and ideas freely.  They behave
similarly; the visible differences can mostly be attributed to different
programming styles.  All are derived from PD-UTL.BA1, by Phil Wheeler, for
which we both thank him.

The major differences in the programs are that PDM and .jr2 offer a prompted
overwrite option and check to see if Powr-Disk/DOS is loaded.  .jr2 defaults to
a .DO extension if none is supplied (the code's in line 7, & easily changed if
you wish -- substitute .BA or .CO for .DO).  PDM has disk formatting.  There
are slight differences in the prompts.  There are significant variations in the
programs' structures, and the error traps used differ greatly; these can fairly
be called disagreements about style.

Properly speaking, these are not "menu" programs.  Woods started calling the
project "MENU.jr" early on, since what we were writing was an alternative to
MENU.BA; the name just sorta stuck.

Since all three programs use POKEs, and PDM also uses some PEEKs and a CALL,
they won't work on a Tandy 200 without conversion.  The POKES are to the

keyboard buffer; conversions should be easy.

The intricate code in these programs is largely due to quirks in M100 BASIC,
which does peculiar things when you use SAVEM and LOADM.  The programs are NOT
deliberately difficult to unravel.

The crucial code in these programs involves stuffing the keyboard buffer
(curiously, we're each using a routine written by the other).  Phil's
documentation thanked Tony Anderson for teaching him the technique; my thanks
go (instead) to Jesse Bob Overholt and to Woods.

Programmers attempting to edit or revise these programs are STRONGLY advised
to study the behavior of variable I, which does some things you may not
expect.

A WARNING:  Experience suggests that .jr2 can crash a Model 100 with Powr-Disk
installed.  At fault is LFILESV, which is a legal command for Powr-DOS but
which apparently does unfortunate things to Powr-Disk.

Finally, a resounding THANKS! to Ed Giese of Acroatix.  Powr-Disk is
(REMAINS!) the most exciting computer purchase I've made since I bought my
Model 100.
