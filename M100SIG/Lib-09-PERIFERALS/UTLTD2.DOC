  UTLDIC.TD2 is a disk dictionary utilities program specifically written
for the Model 100 or Tandy 200 with the Tandy portable disk drive utilizing
either POWR-DISK or TS-DOS operating systems. This program looks-up
individual words, removes individual words, prints words in the files, and
counts words in the files.
	
  The disk dictionary must be set-up as described in SPLTD2.DOC.
	
  The first thing the program does is verify that all dictionary files exist
and keeps track of what sequential files are on what disk, if multiple disks
are utilized. When using a multi-disk system the program will prompt you when
it is necessary to change disks. Next the program displays its menu and
prompts for selection.
	
  If look-up individual words or remove individual words is selected, the
program prompts for word entry. Once the word is entered it is tested to see
if it starts with a letter, all letters are lower-case, and that it contains
only letters, a hyphen or an apostrophe. Once these conditions are met it
continues. If no word is entered (Enter alone hit), the program will return
to its menu.
	
  When removing words from the dictionary files the whole dictionary
file is copied into RAM and all occurances of the word are removed. Then
the new file is copied back to the disk.
	
WARNING: When removing words the computer must have enough free memory
space to contain an entire individual dictionary file.
	
  When selecting print or count, a list of program names is displayed along
with the choices all, each, exit, and menu. Move the cursor over your
selection using the arrow keys then hit enter.
	
  Selecting menu will immediately return you to the computer's main menu.
  Selecting exit will immediately return you to the program's menu.
  Selecting each will print or count all files starting with DICT-A.DO, but
will wait before going on to the next file until a key is hit.
  Selecting all will print or count all files starting with DICT-A.DO and will
not delay before going on to the next file.
	
  The print routine is originally set-up for 80 characters wide, 66 lines long,
and continuous form paper. The printouts are titled, dated, and page numbered.
If you wish a different character width change CW= in line #2, for a different
line length per page change LL= in line #8, and for single sheet paper change
PT$="C" to PT$="S" in line #8.
