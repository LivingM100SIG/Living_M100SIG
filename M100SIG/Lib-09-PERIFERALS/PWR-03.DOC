                                 POWR-DOS Basics


          You cannot see POWR-DOS on your computer's menu.  It is an
          invisible program whose primary purpose is to enhance TEXT
          and BASIC.  In this chapter, we discuss how to use the most
          commonly used enhancements.


                                Basic Procedures

                               Is POWR-DOS Active?

          There will be times when you want to ask yourself, "is
          POWR-DOS installed?"  This question will naturally occur to
          you immediately after first loading it.  To find out, get
          into BASIC.  Enter the command LFILES V and press [ENTER]. 
          If POWR-DOS is not installed, you will get an ?FC error.  If
          it is installed, you will get a message showing the POWR-DOS
          revision number.  Example:


          LFILES V[ENTER]          <--- (You type this)
          Powr-DOS 2.1 (c)1986 Acroatix
          OK


                              Loading a BASIC File

          In addition to the invisible part of POWR-DOS, your owner's
          diskette contains seven application programs.  All seven are
          written in BASIC; the most important of these is called
          DMENU.BA.  The next chapter discusses DMENU in detail, but
          before you can use it, you must load it.  To load DMENU.BA,
          get into BASIC and enter the following commands:


          Load ":dmenu[ENTER]      <--- (You type this)
          Save "dmenu[ENTER]       <--- (You type this)


          Once you have loaded DMENU, you can run it immediately by
          entering the BASIC command RUN, or return to the main menu
          and run it from there.  If you are in a hurry to get started,
          skip on to Chapter 3 now.  But don't forget that, even
          without DMENU, you can still access your PDD with POWR-DOS. 
          You can load any BASIC program from disk using a similar
          technique.

                          Examining Disk and RAM Files

          POWR-DOS adds a powerful new command to your computer's
          BASIC: LFILES.  In its simplest form, LFILES list the files
          on the current disk. Example:


          Lfiles[ENTER]            <--- (You type this)
          CLEAN .BA     207
          DIARY .DO    1981
          FDP   .BA     940
          PCAL  .BA    1326
          PTODO .BA     815
          SETUP .BA     215
          SRCH  .BA    1321
          Space or Break
          TASK  .DO    3755
          TMPC  .BA     189
          TMPC  .CO    9599
          UPDATE.BA      60
              56 Sectors free
          Space or Break
          OK


          (NOTE: The 200 Display is different; there are more files
          between breaks, and the pause message is different.)

          On the Model 100 (only), the screen clears after each "Space
          or Break" t speed the scrolling.  At each point where the
          display stops, you may continue the listing by pressing the
          space bar, or abort it with SHIFT-BREAK or Control-C.

          You can see a very similar display of files in RAM by
          entering the command LFILES R.  This command will list all
          visible RAM files and their lengths.  Example:


          Lfiles R[ENTER]          <--- (You type this)
          DMENU .BA    2327
          TASK  .DO    3755
          TMPC  .BA     191
          UPDATE.BA      62
          Space or Break
          OK

          Helpful Hint: If you will be using BASIC often without DMENU,
          you may want to define an unused Function key as follows:


          Key 7, "CLS:LFILES "[ENTER]   <--- (You type this)


          (Note: Tandy 200 users can omit the CLS:.)  After this
          command, the [F7] Key will types the LFILES command for you;
          simply press [F7][ENTER] for disk files and [F7] R [ENTER]
          for RAM files.


                              Saving BASIC Programs

          After creating or change a BASIC program, you may want to
          save it to disk.  To save the program, simply enter the
          following command:


          Save ":progrm[ENTER]     <--- (You type this)


          (NOTE: Use your BASIC program name instead of "progrm".)

          The SAVE command will overwrite any existing disk file
          without warning.  In the context of normal BASIC development,
          the automatic overwrite is a convenient feature.


                          Loading and Saving Text Files

          If you have used your computer's TEXT program with the
          cassette player, you know that [F2] loads from cassette, and
          [F3] saves to cassette.  With POWR-DOS active, you can add an
          extra colon (":") to the file name to load and save files to
          diskette.

          To load a new file from diskette, you must first create that
          file in RAM using TEXT.  Create it just as you would any new
          DOcument file.  Once you see the blank screen and the
          flashing cursor, press [F2].  TEXT will prompt you "Load
          from:"; enter the disk file name preceded by a colon (":"). 
          If you omit the ".DO" extension, POWR-DOS will add it for
          you.  Remember, the TEXT prompt also contains a colon, so the
          bottom line of your screen will look as follows:


          Load from::memo
          Chapter 2               POWR-DOS Basics             Page 12


          (NOTE: The file name may be different from "memo".)  There
          are two colons in all: one from the computer, and one from
          you.

          To save a file to disk, press [F3].  TEXT will prompt you
          "Save to:"; enter the disk file name preceded by a colon
          (":").  If you omit the ".DO" extension, POWR-DOS will add it
          for you.  Once again, remember that there will be two colons
          on the bottom line: one from you, one from the computer.  If
          you specify an existing disk file, POWR-DOS will
          automatically overwrite it with the new file you are saving.


                                The Memory Eaters

          There are four different uses for memory that do not appear
          on your computer's menu.  The paste buffer contains
          characters that will appear in TEXT when you press the PASTE
          key.  The unsaved BASIC program is the program that lists
          when you get into BASIC from the menu and enter the LIST
          command.  The reserved memory is an area used by many
          machine-language programs; you can determine its length by
          entering the BASIC command: PRINT MAXRAM-HIMEM.  Invisible
          files will not appear on your menu, although they are normal
          files in every other sense.  POWR-DOS resides in an invisible
          BASIC file; your computer may contain other invisible files
          as well.

          You should realize that there are three other "invisible"
          memory eaters besides POWR-DOS.  When you need more memory,
          check these three memory eaters first, and eliminate them. 
          You can eliminate all three from BASIC with two commands:


          CLEAR 0,MAXRAM[ENTER]    <--- (You type this)
          NEW[ENTER]               <--- (You type this)


                              Deactivating POWR-DOS

          As nice as POWR-DOS is, you may occasionally want to remove
          it from you computer.  To remove it, get into BASIC and enter
          the following command:


          LFILES OFF[ENTER]        <--- (You type this)
          Chapter 2               POWR-DOS Basics             Page 13


          Be certain that you have loaded in a copy of PL.BA before
          entering this command.  Otherwise, you may find it necessary
          to type in IPL.BA and reset your drive's DIP switches when
          re-loading POWR-DOS later.  LFILES OFF removes POWR-DOS
          completely from memory.


                                Notes and Options


                            Side Effects of LFILES V

          POWR-DOS enhances BASIC by installing about a dozen "hooks"
          into the ROM.  Some software - particularly several ROM
          packages from PCSG - modify the hook table, effectively
          disabling part of POWR-DOS.  The LFILES V command, in
          addition to printing a message, also restores the hook table. 
          It is this behavior (not vanity) that led us to include the
          LFILES V statement in each of the application programs.  You
          can use it also, particularly if you are getting ?NM errors
          when trying to access the disk.


                       Options when Loading BASIC Programs

          If a BASIC program exists on disk in ASCII format (as a DO
          file), you can use LOAD to convert it to BASIC format.  You
          can also MERGE ASCII-saved programs directly from disk. 
          These options allow considerable flexibility and power when
          dealing with public domain software, which almost always
          downloads in ASCII format.

          After LOADing a BASIC program, you can SAVE it to a different
          name in RAM, or a different name on disk using SAVE.  Or, you
          can leave it "unsaved".  In this case, it will not appear on
          the menu, but will still RUN and LIST from BASIC.  It will be
          one of the "memory eaters".


                               Options with LFILES

          You can direct LFILES output to your line printer or to a
          file.  The syntax is simple:


          LFILES TO "LPT:"[ENTER]  <--- (You type this)

          or:

          LFILES TO "file"[ENTER]  <--- (You type this)
          Chapter 2               POWR-DOS Basics             Page 14


          (NOTE: "file" can be any legal DOcument file name.)  If you
          specify a file, LFILES will replace any existing file with a
          new listing.  When you use the TO option, there are no "Space
          or Break" prompts or cleared screens.  LFILES TO is useful
          when creating labels of backup diskettes or a
          diskette-library index.

          You can use the TO option in addition to the R option.  Using
          both will send a RAM directory listing to your printer or to
          a file.


                                Text File Options

          In TEXT, you can load disk files with different names than
          the RAM filename you are editing.  Further, text you load
          with [F2] will always appear at the end of your file.  This
          behavior makes TEXT, combined with POWR-DOS, a convenient
          tool for concatenating files.


                               Errors and Recovery


                             LFILES V has no Errors

          The LFILES V command should never give you an error while
          POWR-DOS is active.  If it gives an ?FC error, POWR-DOS has
          been deactivated; if it gives any other error, you should
          immediately deactivate POWR-DOS and re-load it.  See the
          "Errors and Recovery" section in Chapter 1 for details.


                              Disk Errors in BASIC

          All disk-related errors in BASIC result in a two-letter code. 
          For example, ?ND stands for "no disk".  Refer to the
          error-code summary at the back of this manual for a complete
          listing.


                               Quirks of LFILES TO

          LFILES TO has a few peculiarities when writhing to a DOcument
          file.  For full details, refer to the LFILES description in
          Chapter 7, which lists all the BASIC command enhancements.
