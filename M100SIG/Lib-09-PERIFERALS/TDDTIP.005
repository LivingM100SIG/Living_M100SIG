The following short program patches the
FLOPPY.CO after LOADMing into high mem-
ory so that the function key labels are
where they should be (LCD line 8, just
above the key numbers).  To use it, put
FLOPPY.CO in high mem by following the
instruction in the Operation Manual or
by LOADM "FLOPPY.CO"; then RUN FXMENU.
The FLOPPY program in high memory will
be patched. Now CALL 59400 to see the
new funtion menu.  For easy use, SAVE
this call as a one line BASIC program,
and run it instead of FLOPPY.  I have
modified my working copy of FLOPPY with
the changes in FXMENU, but the method I
used is tedious involving converting
FLOPPY.CO to FLOPPY.DO, modifying it by
hand, and then converting it back to
FLOPPY.CO.  I suspect there are easier
ways to go.  Comments are welcome.
