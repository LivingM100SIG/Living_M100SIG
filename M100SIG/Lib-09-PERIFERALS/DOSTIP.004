     Revised 10-25-86
     For any novices out there, peeking around the sectors with Powr-Dos is 
easy, and doesn't require (as I had feared) understanding of machine language. 
I have put together three VERY short programs that do everything.  They have no
prompts or error checks, but are easy to fool around with
     One warning: backup any important files you have in RAM.  These programs 
cannot hurt your disks, but they MIGHT do something funny to your RAM.  I have 
noticed that poking a sector right under MAXRAM, which is demonstrated in the 
Powr-Dos manual, corrupts some Supera function keys, for example.


To load a sector to RAM (input sector number...the directory is 0 and the 
others are numbered 1 to 80):

10 CLEAR256,MAXRAM-1292
20 X=0:INPUTX
30 DSKO$0,X,HIMEM

To read a sector's ASCII equivilant (input # of bytes after the beginning, [ 
ENTER] alone gives whole sector):

10 CLS
20 X=0:INPUTX
30 FORI=HIMEM+XTOMAXRAM
40IFPEEK(I)>31THENPRINTCHR$(PEEK(I));:NEXTELSENEXT

To print the decimal numbers in each byte followed by their ASCII equivilants (
input the same as the second program above):

10 CLS
20 X=0:INPUTX
30 FORI=HIMEM+XTOMAXRAM
40 PRINTPEEK(I);
50IFPEEK(I)>31THENPRINTCHR$(PEEK(I))ELSEPRINT
60 NEXT
