TXTDMP.CO
A Model 100 Cassette Load/Save Program  By Ron Bean  8/86

WHAT'S THIS PROGRAM FOR??

   This program loads or saves DO files to cassette in a single continuous
block instead of the usual 256-byte blocks, saving time and tape.

HOW DO I MAKE IT WORK??

   TXTDMP.CAS creates a 528-byte CO file ending at the address you specify.
When you enter TXTDMP.CO from the main menu it will ask if you want to <L>oad
or <S>ave a file. Then it will ask you for a filename for the RAM file (without
the .DO extension). IF you are <L>oading and the file already exists, it asks
if you want to Append the tape file to the RAM file. If you don't answer with y
or Y it kills the file and creates a new one. Then it asks for the name of the
tape file (also no extension); if it's the same you can just enter a CR. Then
it will turn on the tape motor and save or search for the file. IF it finds a
normal DO, BA or CO file it will print "Skip:name" on the screen but will not
stop the tape. When it finds one of its own files it will stop and print
"Found:name" or "Skip:name" and act accordingly. If you press <BREAK> it will
exit to BASIC (due to the ROM calls used). When it's done it will exit to the
main menu. CLOAD, CLOADM, and TEXT F2 will not recognise TXTDMP files.
