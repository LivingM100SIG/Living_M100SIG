DOSTIP.011: On LFILES MENU
==========================

The Powr-DOS command set includes the command LFILES MENU.  A couple notes on
why it's preferable to MENU for a program exit.

LFILESMENU does two things:  It resets STAT to whatever it was when the
program began, then closes everything down and exits to MENU.  That first step
is significant; if the program doesn't reset STAT, you'll have to reset it
yourself when you use TERM.

All of this matters because M100's COM port does multiple duty.  LFILESMENU can
be thought of as a user-friendly program exit.

How much this matters depends mostly on how you use your computer.  Since I
mainly do file transfers from Bank 2 but use TELCOM from Bank 1, it's not an
important concern for me.  Likewise, I mostly use telecommunications programs
which automatically reset COM; again, this is less important to me than to
others.

Since, on the other hand, I write lots of software for other users, I try to
keep this one right.
