           Could you use another 3.5K of memory with the Tandy Disk 
         Drive Operating System in memory?
           The DOS takes around 7K when loaded into a Mod-100 or a Tandy 
         200.  You can cut this in half when not actually using the 
         FLOPPY.CO program.
           There is two(2) ways of doing this.
         
         1). By using two short basic programs "CLEAR.BA" AND "DISK.BA". 
         When you want to use the disk, run DISK.BA.
           It will run FLOPPY.CO after clearing memory properly. When 
         finished run CLEAR.BA. This will give you 3.5K of memory to use 
         until you need to use the disk again.
          
           DISK.BA Program:
          
         10 CLEAR256,59400'(57500 for Tandy 200)
         20 RUNM"FLOPPY.CO"
          
           CLEAR.BA Program
         10 CLEAR0,MAXRAM
          
          
         2). The second way is to use the FUNCTION KEYS [F6] & [F7].
           To do this you must have the above DISK.BA program installed.
           CLEAR.BA is NOT needed. In BASIC type in the following:
          
         KEY6,"CLEAR0,MAXRAM"+CHR$(13)
          
         KEY7,"RUN"+CHR$(34)+"DISK.BA"+CHR$(13)
          
           This allows you to use [F7] to use the Disk and [F6] to 
         regain memory when finished. A good idea with the Mod-100 is to 
         get the TELKEY.BA program and change the [F] KEY statements to 
         read as the above.
         
           You don't have to worry about the Disk Drive being on. It 
         will not 'Bomb' the computer if it's not.
