RENAME.PDS is a disk file rename utility, in BASIC, for the Tandy Portable
Disk Drive.  This program REQUIRES Powr-DOS from Acroatix.


Operations
==========
This program spends a few seconds setting itself up -- reading the disk
directory, mainly -- and asks which file you wish to rename.  After you
respond, RENAME checks to see if the file's actually in the disk directory; if
it locates the file, you'll be asked for the file's new name.  You'll then be
asked if you wish to rename another file.  If you respond to this prompt with
"N", the program sorts the revised directory and writes it to the disk.

Please note the following:

** RENAME expects that there will be a disk in the drive when the program
starts.

** This program will add a .DO extension if none is specified.

** Since RENAME will not permit you to change the file's extension, there's
no need to specify the extension on the new name.

** If the new filename is longer than six characters (excluding extension),
RENAME will shorten it.

** Duplicate filenames are checked for and are not permitted.

** Responding to the "Rename another?" prompt with <ESC>ape will exit to the
computer's main menu.

** While RENAME does automatic conversions from lower to upper case, it does
no other checks to verify that the file's name is "legal".

Miscellaneous Notes
===================
This is a vastly improved version of this program.  I dashed off the original
version in three hours, and my only concern was that it actually work.  This
program's essentially all new; every routine has been rewritten.  Particularly
noteworthy are that the error traps have been greatly improved (disk/drive
problems don't force you to exit the program) and that the read, write, and
sort routines are MUCH quicker.  It may still be faster to rename single files
by copying them to RAM and back, but it's now real close -- and this program's
a lot more convenient.  For multiple files on a single disk, there's no
contest.

This program defaults to a .DO extension.  This can be easily changed; the
variable is FE$ and lives in line 8.  If you generally store some other sort
of file, you may wish to amend this feature.

Most of the code here is pretty routine stuff.  The interesting reading is
the directory read routine in line 7 and (especially) the directory write
routine in line 16.  (I'm still planning to write a DOSTIP on random access;
should be soon.  This was the last problem I needed to solve.)

I'm offering this program on a shareware basis; $5.00 contributions will be
greatly appreciated.  If you keep and use the program, please send me a check;
my address is in the program's remarks.  (Please feel free to share the
program on a BBS; DON'T delete the remarks before you do so.  Thanks.)
