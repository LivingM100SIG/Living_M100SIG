NODE.DOC:  Documentation for NODE.BA which is installed by NODE.BAS (checksum
344,630 with real tabs).
Requirements:
       Tandy 100/102/200 notebook computer
       Node DataPac (125k/256k) with the OPTION ROM
       Power DOS in DataPac (optional)
       TS-DOS disk version in DataPac (optional)

     NODE.BA combines lightning speed and alphabetized directories with your
Node DataPac.  After you try this 3.3k program, you will have little reason to
leave the NODE.BA environment.  You can jump around from file to file in your
DataPac using your paste buffer as you go.  In most cases you do not have to
retype file names.  Your paste buffer will remain intact as long as you do not
do anything to clear it.  (Loading DOS and other .CO programs and running some
BASIC programs clears memory and thus your paste buffer).

     This program provides handy access to your favorite disk operating
systems directly from NODE.BA.  I use NODE.BA to shuffle instantly between
TS-DOS and Power-Disk (Power-DOS for the 100/102).  Of course you must have
the DOSs located in your DataPac.

    NODE.BA options require only one key stroke and are listed in four groups
as seen in the options prompt line below.  <Q>uit is all there is in the first
group.  The second group is related to both main RAM and your DataPac.  The
Third group is related to your DataPac only, and the fourth group is related
to main RAM only.  ".DO" is automatically added to file names if you type no
extension.  The following option explanations appear on the title screen and
reappear when you press space bar at the options prompt line (below).

     [F8] or typing MENU exits you to your main RAM menu
     <Q>uit turns off your computer or runs another program from RAM
     <M>emory tells you the free memory in both RAM and your DataPac
     <F>ind gives you the length of a file in RAM and DataPac
     <C>atalog gives you the RAM files and then five choices to view:
        <A> All files in DataPac
        <B> .BAsic files in DataPac
        <C> .COmmand files in DataPac
        <D> .DOcument files in DataPac
        <L> Lfiles disk directory (Power-DOS must be installed).
        You now choose where you want the catalog sent:
           <F>ile (The name FILE.DO will be used if you just press <ENTER>)
           <P>rinter
           <S>creen
           Note:  All but the RAM menu are are in ALPHABETICAL ORDER!
     <E>dit is used to start a new DOcument in DataPac
     <R>un a .BA program or edit an existing DOcument in DataPac
     <S>ave a file from main RAM to DataPac
     <L>oad a file from DataPac to main RAM
     <D>elete a file from DataPac
     <I>nvisible and <V>isible are not programed in this version
     <N>ode installs the option ROM hooks with the 200
     <K>ill a file in RAM
     <P>ower-DOS is activated from DataPac (proper memory is cleared)
     <3>.5 disk gives you four options for Power Disk access (bank #0, TDD2):
           <S>ave a file from RAM to disk (must not already exist on disk)
           <L>oad a file from disk into RAM
           <K>ill a file on the disk
           <F>ormat disk (must be preceded by another DOS operation)

     <T>S-DOS is activated from DataPac  (proper memory is cleared)
     <]> Clears the past buffer and memory of DOS or other machine language
   program.

      You can use your paste buffer to control NODE.BA.  If you have files,
SCIA.DO, SCIB.DO and SCIC.DO that you frequently need to backup to disk, put
the the following in your paste buffer (each line ends in a carriage
return).  Make sure the disk is ready and press PASTE while at the NODE.BA
option prompt line.  Like magic, all the files will be saved to disk and your
computer will shut itself off when finished.

     Q (Q should be the last character in your paste buffer -no carriage
return)

     To restore the files to your DataPac from disk PASTE in the following:

     3LSCIA
     RUN
     SSCIA
     KSCIA
     3LSCIB
     RUN
     SSCIB

     RUN
     SSCIC
     KSCIC
     F""
     MENU
     <ENTER>
     BEEP
     POWEROFF


     Try typing the above keystrokes in manually and you will understand how
it works.  The same technique can be used for many other purposes.

     NODE.BA does not contain a CLEAR statement.  This is what allows your
paste buffer to remain intact.  If you get an OS error while using NODE.BA,
type CLEAR 120:RUN <ENTER>

     Most other errors are trapped.  Due to the way Power Disk interfaces with
BASIC, the screen is immediately cleared after errors when loading a file from
disk.

     Use NODE.BA in main RAM but keep a copy in your DataPac for easy
reloading after a cold start.

     INSTALLATION (takes 1-2 minutes):
       (1) Check that you have about 10k of RAM free
       (2) Put NODE.BAS in your paste buffer
       (3) Enter BASIC from your computer's main menu
       (4) Type NEW<ENTER>
       (5) Press the PASTE key and ignore the error messages.  That's it!

                VARIABLES
      A$(0)=USING      A$(I)=FUNCTION
      F$=FILE NAME     C=CALL (NODE)
      CC=Call (CLEAR)  D=PEEK length
      F=#FILES         I$=INPUT $
      I=INPUT# & ERR   L=length
      N=Node Code      P=Poke to run

TECHNICAL NOTES:
       Line  5 pokes RUN<ENTER> into the keyboard buffer to recover when disk
                operations stop program execution
       Line   6 calculates the length of a file
       Line   7 accepts file input from the keyboard and traps the NU of MENU
                 when [F8] is pressed
       Line   8 adds .DO to the file name if necessary
       Line   9 sets up PEEKs, POKEs & CALLs for the 200/100/102
       Line  10 contains the menu option strings as DATA elements
       Line  45 sets the auto-shut-off delay to 1 minute (change as you like)
       Line 100 responds to the <Q> option and can be changed to 100 RUN"ALT"
                 to run another program (in this case ALT.BA)
       Line 455 picks the next file

     NODE.BA includes the features that I use most often.  There are many
additional features that you might find handy, but they will eat up more
memory.  Please give me feedback snout your use of the program.  Happy
NODE-ing to you with your laptop!
