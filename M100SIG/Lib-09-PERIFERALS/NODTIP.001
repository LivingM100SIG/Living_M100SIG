I received my Node 256k unit, installed same, and it worked exaxtly as
expected, the first time! The only thing that was not crystal clear was the way
to clear the "hook" memory if you execute a .ba program from the rambank. The
way I've come up with is a 1 line basic program that has 1{menu as it's program
line. Execute this by putting the cursor over the program name while at the
expanded ram's file menu. That does it. Otherwise, your main memory (original
24/32k) is decreased by the size of the last basic program run. This is the
only thing that was not perfectly clear in the instructions. Another slight
imcompatability is with Node and Ultrascreen. If you enter the rambnk from main
100 memory with the small screen selected, the computer beeps at you and the
only way to regain control is to reset. So remember to turn Ultrascreen off
before entering expanded memory.
     It is strange to have em8, sxm, a word processor in basic that takes 8k,
and still hve 203k free for whatever! Mark
