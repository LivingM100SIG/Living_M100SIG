ATFIX will allow you to repair a damaged FAT (File Allocation Table). It
assumes that the directory entry for the file has the correct starting cluster
number.

First, use FATPRT.DVI to get a printout of the directory & FAT.

Now run ATFIX.
At the prompt enter the number of the starting cluster for the file. The
current contents of that cluster will be displayed. Enter the new value. (Note
this value on the printout from FATPRT!!! If you make any mistakes you may need
it. That is why the FAT portion of the printout is double spaced)
If you changed the value, you will be prompted for a new cluster number.
If you did not change the value, you will be prompted for a file name. Enter
the name of the file and it's contents will be displayed. This will let you see
if you have added the correct cluster. If not go back and try changing it to a
different cluster.

The main 'bug' with this program is that after adding a few clusters, it takes
*forever* to read all the way thru the file. But the input *must* be done with
INPUT$ so we're stuck.
Second bug is that if the directory entry is messed up it has to be fixed by
hand.
