                   Manual Revision Version 1.00 of 04/24/91







       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
        Section 0
       
                                                                      
                                                                      
       
       
       
                                           Quick Start









                         Quick Start



This  section  is for those of you that hate to read manuals.  Follow  the  instructions 
below  to  get  started  using PC-PDD.  If the quick-start  procedure  does  not  work, 
then, as they say, "when all else fails, read the manual."

The   procedure,   outlined  here,  applies  for  hard  disk   installations,   dual   drive 
configurations   (includes  "permanent"  ram-disks  such  as  found  in   the   Toshiba 
T1000), and single floppy installations.

The example below assumes that you are installing the program from floppy drive A 
to hard disk C in the subdirectory C:\PC-PDD.  The symbol <enter> means that you 
are to press the Enter key.

          1.  Read Appendix A FIRST!,
          2.  Make a backup of the distribution disk,
          3.  Put the PC-PDD backup disk in drive A.
          4.  Type A: <enter>
          5.  Type INSTALL <enter>

You should see a screen similar to the one below:

   





















6.   Answer all of the questions.  You can use the normal editing keys to  change  the 
answers.   The  arrow  keys, insert, delete, home, end, and  backspace  keys  perform 
their  normal  functions.   The  enter key, the up arrow,  and  the  down  arrow  keys 
move you from field to field.






       7.  Single floppy users: You'll need to read the installation process in Section 1.   The 
       INSTALL program will create a batch file that will perform the installation.
       
       8.  Press the F10 key to start the installation process.  Press the ESCape key to  bail 
       out to DOS.
       
       9.  Put the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
             COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM
    or where COMMAND.COM is on your disk.
       
       10.  Make sure the PDD is hooked up to the correct PC serial port, and that the
       power is on.
       
       11.  Change directory to the DOS directory you wish to work with.
       
       12. Type C:\PC-PDD\PC-PDD <enter>
       
       13. You're on your way !  Hopefully...  If not, read Section 1 on 'Getting Started,'
       which you should do sooner or later.
       
       
       
       
                        
                           
       
       
                Don't  WRITE  Dos  files  to  your  archive 
             PDD  disks.  Use a scratch disk  instead.   If 
             you do, be sure that you have a backup disk 
             or backup copies of the files.
       
       
       
       
                        
                           
       
       
                 CAUTION!   This procedure is enough  to 
             get  you  up and running with  PC-PDD.   It 
             won't,   however,  tell  you  how  to  use   the 
             program.   You still need to read the rest  of 
             the manual.

                    Introducing PC-PDD



Welcome to the wonderful world of data interchange!  PC-PDD is a file management 
system  for  Tandy  Portable Disk Drives (PDD).  PC-PDD runs on your  IBM  PC  or 
compatible and lets you hook up your PDD and read/write data files created by your 
Tandy  notebook computer.  PC-PDD supports the PDD Model 1 and Model  2  disk-
ette drives.  Data created by the Tandy Model 100/102/200 computers are supported 
as is the new Tandy WP-2 Wordprocessor.

By  now  you've  probably been exposed to the bizarre and  arcane  world  of  RS-232 
data  transfers.  It's simple really.  You start your PC, connect your notebook with  a 
null-modem  cable (or was it a modem cable?), run a data  communications  program 
(like  Procomm) on the PC, run Telcom on the notebook computer,  match  telecom-
munications parameters,....

Well, you get the idea.  Data transfers between computers can be a real mess.   With 
PC-PDD  you hook up your PDD to your PC, run the supplied program, point to  the 
file  you want transferred, and that's it!  PC-PDD takes care of converting  file  for-
mats  between  your PC and your Tandy notebook computer.  It's  that  simple.   PC-
PDD  is  a  file  management  system.   It provides  you  with  the  ability  to  COPY, 
RENAME, ERASE, and VIEW files on and between your DOS and PDD disks.

PC-PDD supports the following Tandy notebook computer and PDD drives:

     Model 100/102/200          PDD Model 1    (one-bank)
     Model 100/102/200          PDD Model 2    (two-bank)
     WP-2                    PDD Model 2    (one-bank)

The original Portable Disk Drive is commonly referred to as the "Model 1" or  "PDD-
1."   It is able to store up to 100K bytes and up to 40 files.  The "Model 2", or  PDD-2, 
added  a  second directory, or bank.  It is able to store up to 100K bytes and  40  files 
in  each  bank for a total of 200K bytes and 80 files.  The WP-2 uses the  PDD-2  but 
only uses the first bank.  It can, however, use all 200K bytes for the 40 files.

Refer  to  Appendix  C for cautions on mixing disks between  different  model  drives 
and different models of Tandy notebook computers.


What You Need

Here's the minimum equipment you need to run PC-PDD:

          IBM PC, XT, AT or 100% compatible
          512K memory
          1 floppy disk drive
          serial port
          MS/PC-DOS 2.1 or greater
          Tandy Portable Disk Drive

PC-PDD  runs with the minimum configuration listed above.  A more "robust"  con-






       figuration gives better performance and makes your life easier. The exact amount of 
       memory  required  depends  on the version of DOS that you are  using,  the  number 
       and  size of TSRs (such as Sidekick), and other system memory users (such as  print 
       spoolers).   The  512K  memory figure assumes the use of DOS  3.3  and  no  memory 
       resident  programs  or device drivers.  Of all the items above if you  had  to  increase 
       anything go for more memory.  The conventional wisdom in computer-circles is  that 
       "you can never have too much memory."

                       Installing PC-PDD



Package Inventory

Your PC-PDD package should contain the following items:

     PC-PDD disks (5-1/4" and 3.5")
     PC-PDD manual
     (optional) 25-pin serial port adapter


Before Starting...

STOP!   Before  you start the installation process, make a backup copy  of  your  PC-
PDD  distribution  disk.   Now put your original disk in a safe place.   Only  use  this 
disk  if  you  need  to re-install the program on  another  machine.   NEVER,  EVER, 
write to the disk.  Finally, read Appendix A.


Disk Inventory

The  copy of your distribution diskette should contain the following files (there  may 
be more):

     READ.ME           Latest information about PC-PDD
     INSTALL.EXE        Installation program
     PC-PDD.1            The PC-PDD program
     PC-PDD.2            PC-PDD program, part 2
     PC-VIEW.EXE        PC-PDD standalone file viewer
     PC-EDIT.EXE        PC-PDD standalone file editor



To install PC-PDD on your PC you need to:

     1)   Read Appendix A,
     2)   Make a backup copy of your distribution disk,
     3)   Run the installation program,
     4)   Check your CONFIG.SYS file,


System Configuration

At  this point you are ready to install the program on your computer.  Please take  a 
moment to read through the installation instructions before you start.

Your CONFIG.SYS file should contain the following statements:

     FILES=10
     BUFFERS=5

The  example  CONFIG.SYS  file above assumes that you are working  with  a  hard 






       disk C and have, or will, install the software in a subdirectory called PC-PDD.
       The  numbers  for  the  FILES and BUFFERS statements  are  minimums.   If  you 
       don't have a CONFIG.SYS file refer to your DOS manual for details.
       
       Your AUTOEXEC.BAT file should contain the following statements:
       
             SET COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM
             PATH=C:\PC-PDD
       
       The  COMSPEC statement specifies where the program can find a copy of  the  DOS 
       command processor.  This is important so that PC-PDD can call DOS for services.
       
       
       Hard Disk Installation
       
       Place  the  backup copy of your distribution disk into your floppy  drive  (assume  for 
       this example that it is drive A).
       
       Type
        A:<enter>
        INSTALL<enter>
       
       You  should  see the following screen displayed (on the next page).   The  fields  from 
       the installation program screen are:
       
       "Install from Drive"
      Drive letter of the disk drive that the PC-PDD disk is in
      (e.g. A)
       
       "Install to Drive/Directory"
      Where you want to put the PC-PDD software
      e.g. C:\PC-PDD\
      will put the software on the hard disk C and create
      a subdirectory PC-PDD.  The last backslash is important.
 
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       







"Monitor Type"
        C = Color monitor (CGA, EGA, VGA)
        M = Monochrome
        B = B&W (composite monitor with color card)
        L = laptop LCD

"Serial Port"
        PC serial port
        (1 = COM1, 2 = COM2)

"Serial Speed"
        baud rate of PDD.  Typically 19200 unless you have
        a PDD Model 1 set at 9600 baud.

"PDD Model"
        1 = PDD Model 1
        2 = PDD Model 2
        W = PDD Model 2 used with WP-2

"PC Newline"
        how your PC/printer designate the end-of-line in a
        text file.  Most PCs use a carriage return/line feed
        pair (CRLF).  Some machines, such as those used with
        some Tandy printers, store text files with only a
        CR character.

        The Model 100/102/200 computers use a CR/LF pair to
        designate a new line of text.  The WP-2 uses a CR only.

        CRLF = store text files on PC with CR/LF at end of line,
        CR = store text files on PC with CR at end of line,
        NONE = no newline processing.

The  <UpArrow>  and  <DownArrow>  keys  move you from  field  to  field.   Use  the 
<Delete>,  Arrow,  and <Backspace> keys to edit answers in a field.   You  can  press 
the <Enter> if the default answer is acceptable.

Modify  your  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  Restart  your  computer  so 
that the new configuration becomes effective.


To start PC-PDD type

          \PC-PDD\PC-PDD

If  you add the PC-PDD subdirectory to your PATH statement you only need to  type 
the program name to start the program (e.g. PATH=\pc-pdd).  You can also create a 
batch file to start the program.


Dual-Floppy Installation

There  are  a number of possible configurations for dual-floppy  systems.   The  most 
common  will  be to copy the PC-PDD files to your system disk in drive  A.   Drive  B 






       will be used for your data disk.  Make sure that there is a copy of  COMMAND.COM 
       in   the   root  directory  of  your  PC-PDD  system  disk  and   that   the   COMSPEC 
       parameter is set correctly.
       
       You  may wish to create a PC-PDD disk with the PC-PDD program and use the  rest 
       of the disk for data transfer purposes.
       
       Follow the instructions for the hard disk installation.
       
       
       Single-Floppy Installation
       
       Install  the  PC-PDD  software on a disk that you will use for  file  transfers.   If  you 
       wish you make the disk bootable refer to your DOS manual for details.
       
       Place a copy of the PC-PDD distribution disk into drive A.  Type INSTALL.
       
       You MUST answer the first two questions as follows:
       
   Install from Drive : A
   Install to Drive/Directory : A:\
       
       You  may  specify  a sub-directory on the "Install to" question.  The  key  is  to  make 
       sure that the "from" and "to" are both drive A.
       
       See the Hard-Disk installation section to answer the remaining questions.
       
       The  INSTALL  program  will  create  two files on  the  distribution  disk  copy.   The 
       1FLOPPY.BAT file is a batch file that will perform the installation.
       
       After the INSTALL program finishes, type 1FLOPPY at the dos prompt.  The  batch 
       file  will  prompt  you  to swap between the distribution disk  and  your  target  disk.  
       The  distribution  disk  will be assumed to be in drive A.  The target  disk  in  logical 
       drive B.  Note that in single-drive computers, Dos treats the same physical drive  as 
       logical drives A and B.
       
       Next:
       
   Modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files as outlined earlier,
   Reboot your computer,
   Use!






                 
                             
                 Connecting the PDD to the PC




Now that the PC-PDD software is installed, the next, and obvious step, is to connect 
the Portable Disk Drive to your PC.  First, make sure the power to the PC and  PDD 
are  off.   Locate the serial port connector on your PC.  It should be  the  25-pin  plug 
(male)  variety.  If not you need a 9-pin/25-pin adapter.  These are available at  your 
local computer store or from MicroMime.

Attach  a  25-pin  adapter  to  the  serial port connector.   If  you  want  this  to  be  a 
permanent  installation  then remove the screw nuts and attach the  adapter  to  the 
serial port.  Next plug the PDD connector into the adapter.

If  you  will  be  sharing  the port with other devices  (such  as  a  mouse  or  external 
modem)  then  here  are  some  suggestions that might help.   Attach  a  six  foot  25-
conductor  cable  to the serial port.  This will bring the serial port connection  to  the 
front  of  the machine.  Accessing the connector to attach and detach devices  will  be 
easier.   Add  an  A-B switch box for a more  permanent  installation.   Contact  your 
local computer dealer, computer-whiz friend, or write to us for more details.



                          
                             

                      If you have a 9-pin serial port, then you 
               need   a  9-pin/25-pin  adapter.    These   are 
               available   at  your  local  computer   dealer.  
               Buy  an  adapter with both  ends  as  socket 
               (female).




                          
                             

                          If your serial port is behind your          
                    computer, connect a short piece of 25-
               conductor cable from the port to the front of 
               machine.   It  will be easier  to  connect  and 
               disconnect the PDD.






       
       
                        
                           
       
                  If you don't have an extra serial port
                  you  can share one that you use  with 
             your  mouse, modem, or serial printer.   You 
             can  add  an A-B switch  and  can  manually 
             select  which device is active.  Contact  your 
             computer dealer or write to us for details.

                                      Using PC-PDD







                     
                         Using PC-PDD




Now  that  you  have the program installed on your computer, you're  ready  to  start 
working!   This  section  will  tell you how to start the program,  how  to  modify  the 
program's assumptions about your system, and what commands you can use.


Starting PC-PDD

Start PC-PDD by typing

               PC-PDD

at  the DOS prompt.  If you haven't set up a PATH to PC-PDD (see  the  installation 
notes) then you must specify the complete path.  For example

               C:\UTILITY\PC-PDD\PC-PDD

You  may  need to add some "switches" to the program name.  These  switches  alter 
the  assumptions  the  program makes about  your  hardware  configuration.   These 
switches are discussed below and in the SETUP section.


DOS Command Line Switches

PC-PDD keeps your machine configuration in the file PC-PDD.CFG.  You can  over-
ride  these  parameters  when  you start the program.  For  instance  you  may  have 
installed a new display adapter or acquired a new PDD.

The configuration parameters that you can modify and the default values are:

          Display              -C   Color monitor (default)
           Type               -L   LCD screen
                              -B   B&W monitor w/color adapter
                              -M   Monochrome

          PDD                -1   PDD Model 1 (default)
          Type                -2   PDD Model 2
                              -W   WP-2 PDD Model 2

          PC Com Port         -Pn  COM Port n (default = 1)

          Baud Rate           -Bn  COM Port Baud rate (default = 19200)
                                   (applies only to PDD-1)

          PC Newline          -CRLF (default)
                              -CR
                              -NONE








       For  example if you are installing PC-PDD on a laptop computer, the  default  colors 
       look  terrible  on  an LCD screen.  Since you have to run the program  to  get  to  the 
       SETUP menu to change the program settings you find yourself in a Catch-22  situa-
       tion.   The  solution  is to start PC-PDD with the -L switch.  Let's  also  assume  that 
       you are working with data created on a WP-2.  You would start the program for  the 
       first time thusly:
       
        PC-PDD  -L  -W
       
       Once  the  program  is running, use the SETUP menu to change  the  settings  to  be 
       permanent.   If not, the settings specified on the command line apply only  until  you 
       exit the program.
       
       
       Main Window
       
       PC-PDD has one main operating screen:
       
 
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       The  screen  is divided into four information areas: the command  line,  the  dialogue 
       line, the DOS window and the PDD window.
       
       The  command  line  is at the top of the screen, the dialogue line at  the  bottom,  the 
       DOS window on the left and the PDD window on the right.
       
       
       The Directory Windows
       
       The  heart  of PC-PDD are the two directory windows: the DOS window  on  the  left 
       and  the  PDD  window  on the right.  Each window shows  the  files  in  the  current 
       directory of their respective disks.
       






Each  window displays two columns of file names.  The files are displayed  in  "DOS" 
order, that is the order that your PC stores its directory entries.

Each  window  consists of two columns of file specifications.   Each  file  specification 
consists of a filename and a file size.  Directories have a "<DIR>" where the file  size 
information  normally  appears.   The DOS file size display is limited  to  five  digits.  
Files that are larger than 99,999 bytes will displayed in multiples of 1024 bytes.

The DOS Window

The DOS window, on the left side of the screen, displays a list of files for the current 
disk  and (sub-)directory.  A cursor bar highlights the "active" file.  You can  use  the 
cursor  keys to move the cursor bar.  The PgDn and PgUp keys move the  cursor  bar 
up and down a screenfull of files at a time.

The  current  drive  and  directory information (path) is displayed at  the  top  of  the 
window.   The number of free bytes on the current drive is displayed at  the  bottom.  
Up  and  down  arrows  are displayed at the bottom of the  window  to  indicate  that 
there are more files.  You can see the files by scrolling the window up or down.


The PDD Window

The PDD window shows what files are on the PDD disk.  For Model 2 drives, files in 
Bank 0 are shown.  You can see the files in bank 1 by issuing a LOG command.  It is 
useful to think of the two file banks as analogous to two DOS subdirectories.

The  PDD  window  functions just like the DOS window except it shows  what  is  on 
your PDD disk.  The directory path information is styled after the DOS path syntax.

The PDD drive is designated as drive P.  The active bank on the PDD as subdirecto-
ries  0 or 1.  A PDD-1 has only one bank (bank 0) as does the WP-2/PDD-2  combina-
tion.

A drive specification of

        P:\1\*.*

indicates  that all the files on the second bank of a PDD-2 are being displayed.   You 
can  think  of the PDD window as having two subdirectories in the root: 0 and  1.   A 
PDD-1  would only have the 0 subdirectory.  The number of free bytes on the disk  is 
displayed at the bottom of the window.


The Command Line

The command line, at the top of the screen, shows what actions you can select.   The 
highlighted  letter  of each command word is used to select the operation  to  be  per-
formed on the highlighted file.

Each  PC-PDD  command is activated by an "action key."  The action key  is  usually 
represented  by  the first letter of the command.  The "action key" is  highlighted  on 
the command line.

Commands  are  either  file  specific  or  non-file  specific.   The  Copy  command,  for 






       instance,  is  file  specific.   The  Setup  command  is  non-file  specific.   File  specific 
       commands affect the active (i.e. highlighted) file.
       For instance, to copy a file from the PC to the PDD, use the cursor keys to  highlight 
       the  file  in  the DOS windows that you wish to copy.  Press the "C" key  to  copy  the 
       file.   PC-PDD  asks  what  you want to name the file on the PDD.   The  file  is  then 
       transferred  and  the  PDD  window updated to reflect the presence  of  the  file  just 
       copied.
       
       
       The Dialogue Line
       
       The  dialogue  line  is  at  the  bottom of the screen.  It  is  used  for  the  program  to 
       communicate information to you and vice versa.  The program uses the dialogue line 
       to  communicate  status and error messages to you.  The program will  also  ask  you 
       questions  such  as asking for a file name.  The screen display on page  2-2  shows  a 
       copy  operation  from  the PDD to the PC.  The user is being prompted  for  the  DOS 
       filename.  By default, the DOS filename will be the same as the PDD filename.
       
       
       Input Editing
       
       When the program prompts you for information you can edit the default supplied by 
       the program using the following commands:
       
       
       Cursor Movement
       
   <Left>, <^S>              Cursor left one character.
   <Right>, <^D>             Cursor right one character.
   <^Left>, <^A>             Cursor left one word.
   <^Right>, <^F>            Cursor right one word.
   <Home>, <^QS>            Cursor to beginning of line.
   <End>, <^QD>             Cursor to end of line.
       
       
       Insertion and Deletion
       
   <Del>, <^G>               Delete character at cursor.

Point and Shoot

The PC-PDD interface is of the "point-and-shoot" variety.  You point at the file  that 
you want to do something with and "shoot" it by pressing the appropriate  command 
key.  The file cursor moves using the arrow, PgUp/PgDn, and Home/End keys.

For  instance, if you want to delete a file, move the file cursor to the file  in  question 
and press the 'K' key.  PC-PDD will ask if you really want to do that.  If yes, confirm 
by pressing the 'Y' key.  It's that simple!


Navigating the DOS Directories

The DOS file structure allows files to be grouped into sub-directories.  The  PC-PDD 
DOS  window shows the files in the current subdirectory.  You can move  to  another 
subdirectory  on the same disk by moving up and down the directory tree.   To  move 
up  move the file cursor to the ".." entry and press enter.  You'll see a display  of  the 
parent directory.  To move down the directory tree move the file cursor to the subdi-
rectory  name  and press enter.  Subdirectories have a "<DIR>"  notation  where  the 
file size is normally.

To change to a different disk use the LOG command.


                                  
                 Window Independent Commands


The  Window independent commands perform the same or similar  function  regard-
less of which directory window is active.


The ESCape Key

The  ESCape  key can be used to terminate commands in two ways.   When  you  are 
finished  with  an  operation  you use the ESCape key to tell  PC-PDD  that  you  are 
finished and want to continue.  An example would be the Help command.  When you 
are finished reading you press ESCape to return to the main operating screen.

ESCape can also be used to prematurely terminate a command.  For instance if  you 
pressed 'C' to invoke the Copy command, the program will prompt you for a destina-
tion file name.  Pressing ESCape at this point terminates the operation.  No file will 
be copied.

You cannot use the ESCape key to interrupt an operation once it has started.


The KILL Command

The  Kill command deletes the highlighted file.  PC-PDD will ask you  if 
you really mean it.  Once deleted, files are gone forever.  On the PC  you 
can  sometimes  recover a deleted file using unerase  programs  such  as 
the  Norton Utilities.  On the PDD once you erase a file it's gone permanently to  the 
big bit-bucket in the sky.  Be careful!







       The LOG Command
       
       The  LOG  command  will  read  a new disk and  display  the  directory  in  the  PDD 
       window.  Use this command when you change to a new disk.
       
       
       The HELP Command
       
       The  HELP  command displays a short synopsis of the commands you can  use.   The 
       display depends on what window is active at the time.  An example of the DOS  help 
       window is shown below.  The F1 key is an alternate help key.
       
       
 
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       The RENAME Command
       
       The Rename command lets you change the name of the highlighted file.  You will be 
       prompted  for  the  new filename.  The new filename must not  already  exist  in  the 
       current  directory.   For  the PDD the rename command is equivalent  to  the  Model 
       100   Basic  'NAME'  command.   For  DOS  files,  it  is  equivalent  to  the   REName 
       command.
       
                        
                           
       
                    The PDD-1 disk drive does not  directly 
             support   a   rename   operation.    You   can 
             achieve the same effect by copying the PDD 
             file to your DOS disk, deleting the PDD file, 
             and  then copying the file back to  the  PDD 
             with a new name.
       
 






                          
                             

                     The  rename  operation lets  you  give  a 
               PDD file an arbitrary name and a two letter 
               extension.  It is possible to name a file  such 
               that the Model 100/WP-2 cannot access  the 
               file.   Use  the standard  2-letter  extensions 
               for your files.


The SETUP Command

The  Setup  command  lets  you change the  PC-PDD  operating  configuration.   The 
items you can change are:

     Communication Port             (1-4)
     PDD Baud Rate                 (9600,19200)
     Display Type                  (Color, LCD, Mono)
     PDD Drive Type                (PDD-1, PDD-2, WP-2/PDD-2)
     PC_Newline                  (CRLF, CR, NONE)

The setup screen looks like:

   






















The  configuration  data  are kept in the PC-PDD.CFG  file.   The  Setup  commands 
rewrites this file.  Although you can change this file with any standard text editor it 
is best to change it through this command.






                        
                           
       
                The   parameter   settings   displayed   are 
             those  currently  in  effect  rather  than   the 
             contents of the PC-PDD.CFG  configuration 
             file.  If you started PC-PDD with  command 
             line   switches  then  those  values   will   be 
             displayed.
       
       
       
       Communications  Port  :   COM1-COM4  ports  are  supported  by  PC-PDD.   You 
       must,  however,  have the serial port hardware correctly configured with  respect  to 
       your system (e.g. proper IRQ settings).  If you are using COM1 or COM2 you  should 
       not have a problem.  COM3 and COM4 might present a problem.  The rule-of-thumb 
       to follow is if you can use the port with other software it should work with PC-PDD.
       
       PDD  Baud  Rate  :   The PDD-1 can be switched from its  default  speed  of  19200 
       baud  to  9600  baud.   You  might need to do this if  your  serial  port  or  PC  cannot 
       support  the higher speed.  Or if you are using a very long cable to connect the  PDD 
       to your PC.  The PDD-2 has a fixed speed of 19200 and cannot be changed.
       
       Display  Type  :   You should select the Color setting if you  have  a  color  monitor.   
       Use  the  B&W setting if you have B&W composite monitor hooked to  a  color  card.  
       Use  the LCD setting if you are using a laptop.  Some laptop screens do  not  support 
       gray-levels  so  use  the  B&W setting instead.  Use the Mono setting  if  you  have  a 
       monochrome monitor and adapter.
       
       PDD  Drive  Type :  PC-PDD supports two different disk drives  of  three  different 
       types.   Use the "1" setting if you have a 100K PDD-1 (Model 1).  Use the "2"  setting 
       if  you  are  using the PDD-2 and a Model 100/102/200.  Use the "W"  setting  if  your 
       data was created by a WP-2.  The WP-2 does not support the PDD-1 disk drive.
       
                        
                           
       
       
                 After  you  have selected the  correct  con-
             figuration  for your machine you  must  exit 
             the  program and restart it for  the  changes 
             to become effective.
       
       
       
                        
                           
       
       
               Use   the  command  line  switches  if   you 
             want   to   temporarily   change   a    setting 
             without changing the configuration file.
       
       
       






The View Command

The  View  command  lets  you see the contents of your PDD or  DOS  file.   You  can 
"browse"  through  the contents of your file.  A nifty feature is being able  to  look  at 
the file in ascii and hex mode side-by-side.  Selecting a block of text and writing it to 
a new Dos disk file is another handy feature.

Please consult Appendix C for a summary of all the View commands.




                          
                             


                 When    Viewing   a   PDD   file,    PC-PDD 
               creates  a temporary file on your DOS  disk.  
               You  must  have enough space equal  to  the 
               size of the PDD file.





                          
                             


                   For WP-2 users, a DO file is assumed.   If 
               you  want  to view a DA file, xfer it  to  your 
               DOS  disk,  then use the  DOS  View  com-
               mand.    WP-2  DO  files  have  a   128   byte 
               header that is deleted for viewing purposes.




The Xfer Command

The  Xfer  command transfers files to and from the PDD exactly as is.  There  is  no 
attempt to translate between the different file systems.  You can lose the contents of 
your PDD data disk if you use it incorrectly.  Xfer is intended as a "backup"  feature.  
For  instance, you can transfer a PDD file to your PC for storage, and  then  transfer 
it back to the PDD when you need it at a later time.

Potential  problems can arise if you mix the Copy and Xfer commands.  A  good  rule 
of thumb to follow is to use either the Copy or Xfer command in pairs.  If you  trans-
ferred  a  file  to the PC with the Copy command, send it back to the  PDD  with  the 
Copy command.







       The More... Command
       
       The  More...  command  switches  to an alternate set of commands.  The  new  set  of 
       commands  is  displayed  on  the command line.  The More...  command  is  a  toggle.  
       Selecting More... again takes you back to the original command set.
       
       Some  commands,  such as Copy and Xfer have been put in different  command  sets 
       because the keys to activate the commands are next to each other.  The potential for 
       making  a  mistake  is  lowered  by  putting  commands  such  as  these  in  different 
       command sets.
       
       
       The OTHER Command
       
       The  OTHER command popw up a picklist of infrequently used commands.  Use  the 
       up  and down arrows to position the highlight bar over the desired  entry.   Pressing 
       the  enter  key  starts  the  selected  operation.   An  example  of  the  OTHER  menu 
       selected from the Dos window is shown below.
       
             
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       The XFER ALL command transfers (xfer) all files to the other disk drive.  Since  the 
       Xfer  command  transfers  a file as-is, that is, without  any  translations,  the  XFER 
       ALL command can serve as a backup and restore function.
       
       The  COPY  ALL command copies all files to the other disk  drive.   The  appropriate 
       file translations are applied the same as the single file Copy command.
       
       The VERSION command displays the version number of the program.
       
       The  SERIAL # command displays the serial number of your registered copy  of  PC-
       PDD.
       
       The MICROMIME command displays our address and telephone/fax number.
       
       
       The QUIT Command
       
       The QUIT command ends the PC-PDD program and returns you to DOS.






                                  
                     DOS Window Commands



When  the  cursor bar is in the DOS window (on the left side of the  screen),  the  fol-
lowing commands are available:
     Help           Gives a short synopsis of commands
     Copy           Copy Dos file to PDD
     Dos            Go to Dos, and return to PC-PDD
     Log            Read directory of another disk
     View           Browse contents of file
     Edit           Edit a file
     Print          Print a file
     Erase          Delete file
     Rename        Change name of file
     Setup          Change PC-PDD configuration
     Quit           Exit to Dos
     More...         Switch to secondary command line


The COPY Command

The  DOS  Window COPY command transfers the indicated file to the  PDD.   If  the 
drive  type  is  -1  or  -2 the destination filename  must  conform  to  standard  Model 
100/102/200  syntax  or  you will not be able to access your  file  from  your  notebook 
computer.   Use  standard  filenames  of 6 characters followed  by  a  period  and  the 
appropriate two-letter extension (e.g. DO, CO, BA).

If  your  PDD  drive type is -W then you must be especially  careful.   Filenames  are 
eight characters followed by the appropriate two letter extension (e.g. DO, DA).



                          
                             


                  The  COPY command should only be  used 
               to  transfer  text files.  Those files  have  the 
               extension  of  DO  on  PDD  disks.   Use  the 
               Xfer  command  to  transfer  non-text   files. 
               files.


                          
                             


                  Don't  WRITE  Dos  files  to  your  archive 
               PDD  disks.  Use a scratch disk  instead.   If 
               you do, be sure that you have a backup disk 
               or backup copies of the files.






       The DOS Command
       
       The DOS Command lets you "escape" to DOS without leaving the program.  You can 
       perform any DOS function, even run another program.  Type EXIT to return to  PC-
       PDD.
       
       PC-PDD runs another copy of the command processor (COMMAND.COM).  PC-PDD 
       remains  in memory while COMMAND.COM is run in the memory above it.   If  you 
       want  to run another program you may not have enough memory to do so.  You  may 
       not  even have enough memory to execute the DOS command.  If so, the  screen  will 
       flash  and  you will find yourself back in PC-PDD.  Make sure  that  the  COMSPEC 
       environment  variable is set to point to an available copy of COMMAND.COM.   See 
       the installation section for more details.
       
       
       The EDIT Command
       
       The  EDIT  command invokes a full-featured text  editor  complete  with 
       word  wrap, block manipulation, and file import commands.   The  com-
       plete list of editor commands is in Appendix D.
       
       
       The LOG Command
       
       The  LOG  Command in the DOS window forces PC-PDD to read a  new  disk  drive.  
       You  only need to specify the new drive letter when prompted.  You should  also  use 
       this command when you change disks in a floppy drive.
       
       
       The PRINT Command
       
       The PRINT Command sends your file to your printer port.  At this time the program 
       only supports LPT1:.  Be sure that you are printing a text file.
       
       On  some  laptop  computers,  such as the Tandy 1400,  the  printer  and  serial  port 
       connectors  are  too  close  to  be  used  simultaneously.   In  this  situation  you   can 
       disconnect the PDD cable while printing.
       
       Note that the print command is not a text formatter.  The Print command will  send 
       your file to your printer exactly as-is.
       
       
       The VIEW Command
       
       The  VIEW Command lets you browse through a text file.  View is not an  editor.   It 
       only  lets you look at your data.  Use the DOS command to access your text editor  if 
       you  need  to  modify  the file.  You may select a portion of your  file  and  write  that 
       section to another file.
       
       View  responds  in  the usual way to up-arrow, down-arrow,  PgUp,  and  PGDn.   F1 
       displays a command help summary.  Pressing the Escape key will return you to  the 
       main window.  The View commands are summarized in Appendix C.  Wordstar  and 
       Borland products users will feel comfortable with the command set.








                                
                     PDD Window Commands





The BANK Command

The BANK Command switches between bank 0 and bank 1 on a PDD Model 2.   The 
WP-2 does not support bank 1.  Each bank can hold 100K bytes and 40 files,  which-
ever  comes  first.   The  WP-2 can hold 200K bytes but is limited to  40  files  in  one 
bank.

Pressing  'B' switches between bank 0 and 1.  To us a DOS analogy you can think  of 
bank  0  and 1 as subdirectories on a PDD-2 disk.  The current bank is  indicated  on 
the  status line is listed the PDD window.  For instance bank 1 is listed  as  P:\1\*.* 
in the DOS style.


The COPY Command

The  COPY  command  transfers  a  PDD file to a DOS disk.   The  PDD  file  will  be 
processed according to the following criteria:

     If the file is from a WP-2 disk then the file header will be stripped,
     the "garbage" characters at the end of the file deleted.

     All files will received Newline processing according to the PC_Newline
     parameter.  If set to CRLF then a LF character will be added to every
     CR.  If set to CR or NONE no Newline processing will be performed.


If  you  want to store a WP-2 .DO file intact, say for backup purposes,  then  use  the 
XFER command.


The INDEX Command

The  INDEX command is a simple PDD disk cataloging function.  You will  asked  to 
provide  a disk name and a DOS file name.  The files on the PDD disk will  be  listed 
in the DOS file.  If the DOS file exists you will be asked if you want to overwrite  the 
file or to append to it.  A catalog of two disks appear on the next page.

PDD-1 Baud Rate

The  PDD-1  can operate at 9600 baud.  This can be an advantage if  your  PC  serial 
port  can  not handle the normal 19200 baud speed.  The PDD-2 operates at  a  fixed 
speed of 19200 and cannot be changed.

Some older and low-end PCs have this problem.  Connecting cables that are too long 
also can slow the effective data transfer rate of your serial port.

Here's what you need to do to run the PDD-1 at 9600 baud:

1.   Set the PDD-1 dip switches to the ON position.  The switches are  underneath  a 
small cover on the bottom of the drive.


                                                       









The  graphic above shows the switches in the ON state.  The switches should  all  be 
in  the  OFF  state  for normal operations.  Put switch #1 in the  ON  state  for  9600 
baud operation.

     9600 baud       SW1      = ON
                    SW2-4     = OFF

     19200 baud       SW1-4     = OFF

2.  Start the program with the -B9600 switch (e.g. PC-PDD  -B9600).

3.   Select  the SETUP command in the program to select 9600 baud  as  the  default 
operating speed.


We Can't Hear You...

The nature of the PDD communication interface makes it susceptible to  "communi-
cation"  errors.  The PDD communicates with the PC over a serial interface.  This  is 
commonly  known  as the RS-232 standard.  A number of factors conspire  to  garble 
data transfers between the PC and the PDD.

Longer cable lengths weaken the RS-232 signal.  If you add additional cables to  you 
setup  you  can  reach a point where the signal is no  longer  reliable.   PC-PDD  will 
start  to  "hang" the PC.  If you have this problem check your cable  lengths.   If  you 
are  using  switch  boxes  or  other connectors, each  one  introduces  a  "delay."   Try 
connecting the PDD directly to the serial port.







       Long  cable  lengths  can also introduce timing delays.  You can  partially  solve  the 
       problem  with the PDD Model 1 by running the drive at a slower data transfer  rate.  
       The Model 2 can only run at the high speed.
       
       Another  common  problem  with  data  communications is  in  the  PC  itself.   Some 
       inexpensive PCs have serial devices which cannot support the 19200 baud operating 
       speed needed by the PDD.
       
       
       A Higher Intelligence
       
       The Tandy Portable Disk Drive is an "intelligent" device.  It has its own  microproc-
       essor  and  its own built-in command set unlike many simple PC  peripherals.   This 
       frees  an application program like PC-PDD from excessive low-level details.   It  also 
       restricts what the program can do since it is limited by the PDD commands set.
       
       The  PDD  Models 1 and 2 differ slightly in the commands that are  available  to  an 
       application  program  like PC-PDD.  The RENAME command is an  example  of  the 
       differing command sets.  The Model 1 does not directly support a rename  operation.  
       The Model 2 does.
       
       
       Thanks for the Memory
       
       The  program  can  exceed  the amount of memory you have  if  you  select  the  DOS 
       operation.   If  you push the 'D' key, the screen flashes, and you are still  in  PC-PDD 
       then you might have insufficient computer memory to "push" to Dos.
       
       The  first  thing  to  check if the COMSPEC  environment  variable  is  correctly  set.  
       Type  SET at the DOS prompt.  If COMSPEC exists and points to the  correct  direc-
       tory  then  go to the next step.  Refer to Section 1 for additional  information  on  the 
       COMSPEC variable.
       
       If  COMSPEC  is set correctly then your PC does not have sufficient memory  to  use 
       the  Dos command.  You can add more memory or you can unload  memory  resident 
       programs.   Programs such as Borland Sidekick and other  terminate-and-stay-resi-
       dent  (TSR)  programs  can  consume a lot of  your  PC  memory.   Installable  device 
       drivers  (specified in the CONFIG.SYS file -- such as disk caches) can also use  a  lot 
       of memory.
       
       PC-PDD  needs  at  least  256KB  free memory to  operate.   You  can  check  this  by 
       running the CHKDSK command.  Look at the last of line of the display.  You should 
       see at least 262144 bytes free reported.  A sample CHKDSK display is shown below.

9-pin Serial Ports

PC/XT  class machines typically have a 25-pin serial port.  AT class  machines  typi-
cally have 9-pin serial ports.  The PDD has a 25-pin connector.

Since  both  PC  and  PDD  connectors are of the plug  (male)  type  you  will  need  a 
socket-socket  (female-female) adapter.  You need to determine how many pins  your 
PC  serial  port  has.   This will determine the type of  adapter  that  you  need.   The 
appropriate Radio Shack part numbers are given below.  Or see your local computer 
dealer.

You  may  write or call us.  We stock slim-line parts for the 25-pin adapter  that  are 
extremely compact.


WP-2 Files

WP-2  document files have an extension of .DO.  You do not have to convert them  to 
an  ASCII form, files with a .DA extension, before transferring them.   PC-PDD  will 
convert them to ASCII "on-the-fly."

WP-2  DO files have a 128-byte header at the beginning of the file.   PC-PDD  auto-
matically  removes this header.  There is a variable number of "garbage"  characters 
at the end of each file.  PC-PDD automatically removes these also.

Lines  of WP-2 text end with a carriage return (CR) character.  Text files on  the  PC 
typically end with a CR-LF (carriage return - linefeed) pair.  PC-PDD  automatically 
adds  LFs  when transferring TO the PC and strips them when  copying  FROM  the 
PC.   You  can  control  "newline" processing with  the  PC_Newline  parameter  (see 
Setup command).



WP-2 Users : Xfer / Copy Cautions

WP-2  users have to be careful when using the Xfer and Copy commands.   Incorrect 
usage  can  cause  you to lose your data file!  Which commands you  use  depends  on 
what task you are trying to accomplish.

DO NOT MIX Xfer and Copy COMMANDS!

Use XFER, in both directions, if you want to use your PC as a backup to your WP-2.

If  you  use the COPY command, make sure that you use the extension "DA"  on  the 
file when copying to the PDD.  By default PC-PDD uses the "DA" extension for  files 
copied to the PDD.  You can override this but do so with care.  Once the file is in the 
WP-2  memory  it is automatically converted to the DO format as soon as you  try  to 
edit the file.

              Appendix A  -  RFI/EMI Interference


The  Portable  Disk Drive is susceptible to interference generated by  some  comput-
ers.   Our  tests  have  shown that locating the disk drive too  close  to  their  PC  can 
cause  the  drive  to send erroneous data.  This can cause  the  PC-PDD  program  to 
behave  erratically.   Before blaming the program for any  problems  please  consider 
the following data.

RFI/EMI  stands  for "radio frequency interference"  and  "electromagnetic  interfer-
ence."   The  CPU  box  is a source of RFI.  Computer monitors  are  sources  of  EMI.  
There may be other sources causing problems.  Radio transmitters, such as amateur 
radio  hobbyists  use,  can  cause trouble.  Locating the PDD next to  a  TV  can  also 
cause problems.

The solution is to locate the PDD further away from the PC CPU box.  Frequently  a 
few  inches  seems  to  make  a big difference.  Power to  the  PDD  should  be  cycled 
before  restarting the program.  Frequently the interference will cause  your  system 
to lock up necessitating a reboot.

The  CPU speed affects the PDD differently.  The completeness of the RFI  shielding 
of  your  computer also affects the PDD.  The PDD seems to be affected by  a  certain 
RFI  frequency range.  Different CPU speeds generates differing amounts of  RFI  in 
that  range.   The RFI shielding in your computer also affects this.  It  may  be  more 
efficient in attenuating certain frequencies than others.

If  the program seems to operate erratically, try repositioning your equipment.   The 
key seems to be experimenting with your particular setup.






                Appendix B  -  Incompatibilities


PC-PDD  is  known  to  have  the  following  interactions  with  other  software   and 
hardware:


No-Squint Cursor         SkiSoft

     No-Squint Cursor causes data input fields to perform strangely.
     This program is typically used with laptop computers.  When
     PC-PDD asks you for input, say a file name, the area that you
     type your response in is displayed in reverse video.  For each
     character that you type the reverse video extends one character
     to the left.  This is purely a corruption of the video display
     and has no effect on the program or your input data value.




TSRs

     Terminate-and-stay  resident (TSR) programs have the potential  to
     interfere  with  PC-PDD.  We have no evidence that this is a problem
     but  it  is theoretically possible.  The PC serial port operates via  
     an interrupt mechanism.  So do TSRs.  There is a possibility of the  
     interrupts conflicting.  If you are having problems, try remove all
     of  you TSRs and see if the problem clears up.  If it does, then add
     your TSRs one at a time to find the one causing the problem.

     If you are using COM3 and COM4, be aware that these devices share
     the same interrupt as COM1 and COM2, respectively.  If you have a
     serial mouse installed on COM1 and try to use PC-PDD on COM3 then
     the potential for conflict arises.  In this particular situation you
     should de-install your mouse driver while you are using PC-PDD.



Traveling Software Desklink

     DeskLink can not be active.  You must reboot your computer to
     remove DeskLink from memory.



Serial Port Drivers

     Any device driver or program which uses the serial port may be
     incompatible with PC-PDD.  You may have to reboot your system
     to remove a driver or to reset the serial port harware.  On
     occcasion we have had to turn the power off to our system to
     reset the serial port hardware.







                Appendix C  -  VIEW Commands


The  VIEW  commands  use  the  editing keys (Home,  End,  PgDn,  etc.)  as  well  as 
Wordstar-like  commands.  The caret (^) symbol signifies that you should  press  the 
control  key  and  the  next  key together.  For example, to  move  to  the  end  of  the 
current  line  you  may  press  either the End key or  ^QD.   ^QD  means,  press  the 
control  key and the Q-key together.  Then press the D-key.  You may hold  the  con-
trol  key  down  while  pressing  the  second key.   In  PC-PDD  ^QD  and  ^Q^D  are 
equivalent.

                  Appendix E  -  Error Messages


Error  and  warning  messages  should  be  self-explanatory.   There  are  a  class   of 
messages  called  "critical  errors" which you should rarely, if  ever,  see.   These  are 
errors in communicating with the PDD.  Under normal conditions they should never 
occur.   If  they  do the usual source of the problem is RFI or  EMI  interference  (see 
Appendix A).

The error messages have the form:

     Critical Error #nnn

After displaying the message the program will then exit to DOS.
