
        CMerge.BA is a BASIC program that performs the functions of merging 
mail.  If you have a form letter that needs to be printed, you can merge a data
base with the form letter, and this program will create personalized letters
for everyone on your mailing list.  It only works with the Chipmunk disk drive.
        To use CMerge, three files are required.  CMerge.BA must be in the 
computer, and LETTER.DO and ADRS.DO must be in the current Chipmunk folder. It
is possible to create an empty folder that just has these two files, allowing 
the creation of up to 22 form letters.
        I included sample ADRS.DO and LETTER.DO files, along with a sample 
printout.  Each letter will be stored on disk with its own name, starting with 
LETTRA.DO until LETTRV.DO, depending on how many entries there are in your 
address list.  These files can be printed by TEXT, or by any text formatting 
program you may already have.
*** Sample LETTER.DO - Cut here - ***
<full name>
<address1>
<address2>

Dear <salutation>,
        We are pleased to hear that you and <friend> are coming to the
apartment picnic.  Please remember that you agreed to bring <drink> and <food>.
We will see you Saturday.

Sincerely,
