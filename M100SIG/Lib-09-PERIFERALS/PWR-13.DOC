                            Your Portable Disk Drive

          Entire books could be written on the subject of disk drives,
          but this short appendix describes only a few matters of
          prudence and simple curiosity.


                               The 3-1/2" Diskette

          Technology has advanced considerably in diskettes for
          personal computers.  The diskettes used in you r PDD have
          more potential storage capacity than 5-1/4" Diskettes (which
          are still the standard for desktop personal computers), yet
          require less than half the area.  A 3-1/2" diskette holds
          about 100 kbytes of data when used in your PDD; other disk
          drives can squeeze as much as 1.44 megabytes onto the same
          diskettes.

          Further, the 3-1/2" diskette is a step forward in ruggedness
          and reliability.  No part of the magnetic surface is exposed,
          as a spring-loaded metal flap conceals the "window" in the
          firm plastic case.  Be warned, however, that these diskettes
          are not hermetically sealed: avoid dust and dirt; do not
          leave diskettes scattered on a desktop under papers, etc.;
          and do not carry them in pockets of clothing that sheds
          (sports jackets, etc.)  The other constant enemy of diskette
          data is magnetic fields.  The wordless warnings on diskette
          boxes show horseshoe magnets, but remember that speakers,
          motors, and office paper-clip holders all contain magnets. 
          You needn't be paranoid, but don't be careless either.


                             The Disk-Drive Hardware

          The PDD comprises two basic moving parts: the motor and the
          head.  The motor keeps the diskette spinning at a constant
          rate.  The head glides over the diskette to read and write
          the data.  The head can be in one of 40 different positions
          relative to the edge of the diskette; each of these 40
          positions is called a "track".  If you examine the magnetic
          surface of a used diskette, you may be able to distinguish
          lines of the tracks from friction with the head.

          Diskettes must be "formatted" before the drive can
          successfully read or write data.  We recommend formatting an
          entire box of diskettes as soon as the are purchased. 
          Formatting uses up some of the diskette's  storage ability
          for magnetic timing marks, so that the drive controller
          hardware can determine where on the track the head is at any
          point.  After formatting, there are 2,560 bytes of capacity
          left on each track of a diskette.  Further, it divides each
          track into two "sectors" of 1,280 bytes each.  (Other drives,
          with more capacity, squeeze more bytes per track).


                            The PDD Operating System

          It may surprise you that your PDD has software built into it
          - and contains both RAM and ROM hardware - in order to
          control the disk hardware.  The PDD is known as an
          "intelligent" disk drive, since it decides on its own which
          sectors are available and which are full, whether a file with
          a certain name exists on the disk, etc.  Thus, the POWR-DOS
          software merely sends codes conforming to those rules to
          allow the computer and the drive to communicate.

          There are advantages and disadvantages to this arrangement. 
          The principle advantage is that code in the computer requires
          less room.  The principle disadvantage is that the disk drive
          is more or less limited by its internal operating system -
          What it's designers intended for its use.  In this case,
          this limitation means that the files on your PDD must be
          primarily sequential rather than random access.  While it is
          possible to do random access, it is far less convenient than
          sequential access.

          There are several other interesting observations about the
          PDD operating system:


             * The PDD O/S uses a "directory" to keep track of files on
               a diskette.  Every diskette has a directory, which makes
               up a sector on the outside track.  Thus, an empty
               diskette holds 79 more sectors (of 1,280 bytes for a
               total of 101,120 bytes)

             * The directory cannot hold more than 40 names, limiting
               the diskette to 40 files maximum, regardless of size.

             * Each file uses at least one sector, no matter how small
               the file is.

             * The PDD does not create "empty" files, i.e., files of
               zero length.  If you open a file for output and fail to
               write to it, it will not appear in the directory after
               closing it.

             * The PDD can only deal with one file at a time, whether
               for input or for output.

             * PDD file names can be longer than six characters and an
               extension.  The actual limit appears to be something
               more like 24 characters, which can also include lower
               case.  However, POWR-DOS limits names to six characters
               for compatibility with your computer's files, and to
               reduce the amount of space required for the POWR-DOS
               software.
