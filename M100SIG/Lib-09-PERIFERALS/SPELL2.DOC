SPELL2.DOC
  SPELL2.HEX is a hex file containing a machine language spelling checker 
program written for the Model 100 running the Tandy portable disk drive #2 and 
utilizing FLOPY2, the operating system that comes with the drive.  This program
will check a file in under half the time it takes for SPLCHK.BA to check the 
same file, and there is no extra DOS to buy.  As an example, I checked this 
file when it was 3542 bytes long with 638 words.  SPELL2.CO checked it in under
six minutes, while SPLCHK.BA took over 14 minutes to check the same file.  Both
found 41 words that were not in the dictionary, eight of which were misspelled.

  To convert SPELL2.HEX to a machine language file you must use CHANGE.BA or 
CHGHEX.BA in the Utilities DL.
  When you are done writing your file save a copy to the disk, load SPELL2.CO 
and place the dictionary disk in the drive.  Go into basic and CLEAR128,57200, 
return to the MENU. Place the cursor over SPELL2.CO and press ENTER.
  The first thing the program does is prepare the file with a built in version 
of the machine language program DCPREP.  (DCPREP by David W. Willman, 75775,202
3/23/86 Copyright 1986).  This will strip the words, throws out duplicate words
& sort the word list.  You might want to read DCPREP.DOC before you run 
SPELL2.CO.  When DCPREP is finished it will call the spelling checker part of 
SPELL2.CO.
  It will verify that FLOPPY is active and check that the dictionary disk is in
the drive.  You will only get one chance to do it right, otherwise, the program
will have to be started over again.
  The program will tell you which dictionary file it is currently checking.  
Any words in the file that are not found in the dictionary will be left in the 
ram file and the file will be renamed to SUSPEC.DO for later review.  (It is 
best not to have another file named SUSPEC.DO in RAM, if there is you will end 
up with two files with the same name.)  When all the words have been checked 
the program will return to the computer's main menu with a beep. 

Dictionary Preparation:

  The disk dictionary files must be on one disk and must be set-up as follows:
 1.  The first 26 files on the disk must be dictionary files and they must be 
sequential and only in Bank #1.
 2.  The four letters of the first file must be 'DICT'.  It is best to name the
files DICT-A.DO thru DICT-Z.DO with only words starting with that letter within
the file.
 3.  The words within the files must be in alphabetical order, all letters must
be lower-case, word must be on separate lines, with no blank lines and must not
contain spaces but may contain a hyphen or appostrophe as long as they are not 
the first character of the word.

 Notes:
  SPELL2 was written in basic and compiled with TCOMP.  It was written for 
Power-Dos but the DSKO$ command (CALL MACRAMC+24, SEC, ADR) doesn't work with 
the TDD2.  I can convert the program to work with the Tandy 200 if I knew the 
calls for inserting and deleting characters from RAM files.  On the Model 100, 
CALL 27489, CHR, ADR  will insert a character and CALL 27551, , ADR  will 
delete the number of characters in C&D registers.  TD2TIP.005 documents the 
CALL I used for the TDD#2.
