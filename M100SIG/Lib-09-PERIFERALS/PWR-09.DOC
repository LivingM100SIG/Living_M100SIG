                                  Data Recovery

          From time to time, the PDD will malfunction and ruin a
          diskette.  By some derivative of Murphy's law, you can
          predict that it will ruin a valuable diskette without a
          backup.  RECOVR.BA is a POWR-DOS utility that can recover
          some or all of the data.  Even better, if you accidentally
          KILL a file, the chances are good that you can recover it -
          provided that you realize your mistake immediately.


                                Basic Procedures

          Before running RECOVR, prepare a diskette to receive the
          data.  RECOVR moves files from the "damaged" diskette to a
          destination diskette, which does not need to be empty, but
          should be formatted and have sufficient room to hold the
          files.

          Once you have the destination diskette ready, run RECOVR.  It
          will prompt you:


          Insert Source Diskette...press key


          Insert the diskette containing the lost data.  After a short
          pause, the program will respond with one of two messages. 
          Either:


          Directory is damaged.

          or:

          Ignore sectors in use (y/n)?


          In the first case, the directory sector itself has been
          damaged.  This is most often the case when an entire diskette
          appears to be "trashed", i.e., you cannot even use LFILES to
          examine its contents.  In the second case, you can look at
          the diskette contents, but perhaps an important file has been
          deleted or cannot be read properly.  Normally, you will
          always want to ignore sectors that the directory has marked
          "in use", so answer the question with a "y".

          The next message will be a series of messages saying
          something like "reading sector 1". Eventually, the following
          screen will appear:

                     ----------------------------------------


          RECOVR knows that there is a series of sectors that could
          make a file, but it is not smart enough to know what sort of
          file it is: DOcument, BAsic, or COmmand.  You can examine
          each possibility and select a type, or choose to ignore the
          file altogether, using [F1] to [F4].  For each different
          file, RECOVR will give some data:


             * For DOcument-type files, the first characters in the
               file;

             * For BAsic-type files, the first several line numbers;

             * For COmmand-type files, the TOP, END, and EXE.


          Normally, it is simple, using this data, to decide which type
          of file.  (If you're not sure, see the notes in the next
          section.)

          Pressing [F1] to [F4] will do nothing except show you the
          option; you can press them indefinitely until you can decide
          which file type to choose.  Once you do decide, press [F5] to
          GO.  If you choose a file type, RECOVR will ask you for a
          file name.  You must specify a full name, i.e., including an
          extension.  Then RECOVR will begin reading the lost file into
          RAM; eventually, it will prompt you:


          Enter Destination Disk...press key
          Chapter 6              Data Recovery               Page 41


          You may need several swaps before the file is completely
          restored to the destination diskette.  Once the transfer has
          completed, RECOVR will look for other "lost" files on the
          diskette; once all files have been recovered or ignored, it
          prints the message:


          All sectors accounted for...
          Recovered:  nn
          Ignored:  nn
          Bad:  nn
          Allocated:  nn
          Empty:  nn
          Press Space Bar for Menu


          You now have recovered all you can from the diskette.  If
          there were any "bad" sectors on the diskette, you should now
          consider re-formatting it.  Use it carefully until it proves
          reliable, otherwise discard it.

          Recovered BAsic and DOcument files will usually have some
          "garbage" at the end.  You should examine them to remove this
          garbage.


                                Notes and Options

                                How RECOVR Works
          THe PDD divides disks into 80 sectors.  The first sector is a
          directory, which keeps track of the following information:


             * The active files on the disk.  For each file, the
               directory also stores the beginning and ending sectors,
               and the length of the file.

             * Which sectors are "in use" on the diskette.  When your
               computer tries to write more data to the diskette, the
               PDD always uses an unused sector for the data.
          Chapter 6              Data Recovery               Page 42


          RECOVR takes advantage of a peculiarity of the PDD: It does
          not store the precise series of sectors in the directory. 
          Instead, the directory only contains the number of the first
          sector of the file; then, the first sector "points" to the
          second, and so on.  The most common way a disks gets
          "trashed" is by losing the directory; this is logical,
          because the directory is being updated constantly, whenever
          any file changes.  Even without the directory, though, the
          other sectors (provided they are still readable themselves)
          can be used to form a chain which contains a file.

          There are several implications to this basic recovery
          procedure:


             * If a file contains a bad sector in the middle, it
               cannot be fully read.  In the case of DOcument and
               BAsic files, RECOVR can still construct a partial file.

             * RECOVR must assume that the first sector of a file will
               have the lowest number.  This is nearly always a good
               assumption, except when dealing with certain cases where
               a DOcument file has been appended to.

             * The precise lengths of DOcument files and BAsic files
               are not available.  COmmand file-lengths can be
               determined from the TOP, END, and EXE values, stored in
               the file itself.


                             Deciding the File Type

          It is usually obvious which file type makes the most sense. 
          One will look "normal", and the other will be nonsensical or
          unfamiliar.  Here are a few quick tip-offs:


             * A file is almost never a DOcument file unless it
               contains readable text.  Graphics characters are usually
               a dead giveaway that a file is not a DOcument file.

             * If there is only one BAsic line number in the first
               sector of a file, or the numbers are not in ascending
               order, the file is almost certainly not a BAsic file.
          Chapter 6              Data Recovery               Page 43


             * If END is lower than TOP, or EXE falls outside the range
               of TOP and END, it probably isn't a COmmand file.  An
               exception is PCSG (CT and CA) files, which will have a
               TOP of 65535, and an END equal to the file length less
               1, and an EXE of 63012 (for the M100).  Unfortunately,
               there is no easy way to tell whether it is a CA or a CT
               file except by trial and error.


          If you cannot decide which type of file a sector series
          should be, it is probably best to ignore it.  It might be
          some leftover data from an old deleted file.


                               Errors and Recovery

          Data recovery is more of an art than a science.  RECOVR will
          work in many cases, but there are cases when it does not.  If
          you cannot recover your data, you may want to save the
          diskette in anticipation of receiving help from someone else
          in the future; however, we cannot guarantee that you will be
          able to recover anything at all.
