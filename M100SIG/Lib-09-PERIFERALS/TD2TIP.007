DSKMGR.100/200 and the TDD2
---------------------------

Contrary to some statements, DSKMGR will work in all its functions (even
Format) with the TDD2.  But there are some constraints and cautions to
observe.

1) Although you can access all 200K+ of the disk, after formatting it in
   the TDD2, you can write no more than 40 files -- and only read the first
   40 if they have been put there with another OS.  This is due to the Bank
   1 directory being in Sector 1 (with the Bank 0 directory in Sector 0).
   The banks are a directory structure, with the additional 158 sectors not
   allocated to a specific bank.

2) So far as I can tell, writing to a disk formatted in the TDD2, with
   DSKMGR and the TDD2, is completely safe.  The danger would be overwrite
   of the Sector 1 directory (assuming you have been using the disk with
   FLOPPY2); so far as I can tell, this cannot happen -- based on
   examination of sector contents using TD2MON.100.

3) Do not try to write to a TDD2 disk with a TDD1.  It will work, but you
   will end up with a disk with limited capacity showing in Bank 0.  The
   first byte in bank 0 of a TDD1 disk is 00h, and in the TDD2 is 16h.
   Writing to the TDD2 disk with a TDD1 puts 00h in that byte -- and the
   sector access mode apparently will write every byte in the sector except
   that one.  So TD2MON cannot be used to undo the damage. Of course, there
   may be a way I haven't yet found!
