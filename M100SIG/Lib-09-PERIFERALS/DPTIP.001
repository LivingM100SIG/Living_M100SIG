DPTIP.001:

Using DISK POWER with acoustic couplers

For  people  owning  acoustic  couplers ONLY,  here is the procedure to load or
save  files  to disk, while in TERMinal mode in TELCOM.:

Files  operations are of two sorts:

DOWNloading files:

Files  are  downloaded  from  the  host computer  first  to  the Model 100 RAM,
and only upon completion of downloading can  the  file be saved to disk without
losing telephone communications.


UPloading files:

Files are loaded from disk to the Model 100 RAM,  and only then can the file be
transmitted to the host computer.


a) Make sure that the acoustic couplers are  properly  connected  to  the phone
port  on  the  Model 100,  and that the switch on the side of the  Model 100 is
in  the "ACP" position. Verify that the disk drive  is also connected properly.


b) Hook up  to  the  host  computer  as usual and when you need to access (load
or save) disk files, go to step c.


c) Go  into  BASIC  or TEXT by pressing function  key <F6> or <F7> as described
in the user manual.


d) If in BASIC,type LOAD "0:[filename]" or SAVE "0:[filename]"  to load or save
a BASIC program in ASCII on disk.

   You  MUST  return  to  TELCOM  using BASIC's <F6> function key.


e) If in TEXT, load or save files using the function keys <F2> or <F3>, and the
   device name 0:, as in the example:

Press <F2> Load from:0:[filename]
Press <F3> Save   to:0:[filename]

   Return to TELCOM by pressing <F8>.

f) From TELCOM,you can also perform the following  to  make  use  of DISK POWER
   while on-line:


        Enter BASIC using the <F6> key
        Go to  the  MODEL 100 Main Menu <F8>
        Enter DISK POWER
        Perform   the    desired   disk operations (loading or saving)
        Go back to the  MODEL 100  Main Menu
        Go back to BASIC
        Return to TELCOM using <F6> key


As you can see, this  method  is not as straight-forward  as  the  rest  of the
DISK POWER program, and is not included as a feature of DP100 but comes free as
a  very  useful   tip.   Absolutely  no hardware modification is necessary, and
you  can   purchase   off-the-shelf  an acoustic  coupler  at  any  Radio Shack
store.   Note  that  this will NOT work with the direct connect modem cable.
