USE OF TANDY DRIVE WITH PG DESIGN 64K
-------------------------------------


A. PATCHING FLOPPY.CO TO WORK WITH PG DESIGNS 64K RAM

This information was provided by PG Designs.  I'm sure the usual 
disclaimers about no liability for loss of data, etc. apply.

1) Load FLOPPY.CO, per instructions (or from disk)

2) Load MENU*.BA per instructions (can be from disk, if other 
steps are done before loading INVISO, or any other Basic progam --
i.e., MENU*.BA must be the lowest program in the * bank; load from
disk must be done BEFORE modifying FLOPPY per the following steps)
.

3) Enter Basic and do the following:

   CLEAR 256,59400
   LOADM "FLOPPY"
   POKE 61571,154
   POKE 61572,249
   POKE 61573,0
   SAVEM"FLOPPY",59400,62959,59400

4) Save this new FLOPPY.CO to disk as NEWDOS.CO.  In my case, the 
original version has been saved on the same disk as OLDDOS.CO.; of
course, this version can always be derived by re-booting using 
IPL.BA.

5) This change alters pointers in FLOPPY.CO to make the DOS load 
Basic programs into RAM without disturbing MENU; presumably, it 
will work as well with SUPERA.


B. HOW I USE THE DRIVE WITH THE 64K RAM

I have dedicated one bank of RAM for use with the drive; FLOPPY.CO
is the only CO program in that bank.  It is loaded permanently 
into the area above HIMEM and run via a 7-byte machine language 
driver, DOS.CO.  DOS.CO was created by entering Basic and doing:

    'SAVEM"DOS",59400,59400,59400'

This is a useful trick for running most machine language programs,
IF you only have only one M/L program per bank.  I think the 
source of this approach is Jim Irwin (PRN100, LAPWRD, etc.)

Having FLOPPY.CO in one bank, and the PG Designs MENU utility 
installed, it a simple matter to load/save with the DOS bank and 
transfer the files from/to the other two banks.  With this 
approach, files as large as 24K or so can be saved or loaded.  Of 
course, you can load the DOS bank up with other files (for more 
portability) -- and kill them when uou need the added space for 
disk operations.

Finally -- I keep a copy of IPL.DO (not BA, so it can't be run by 
accident) in each bank, just in case!
