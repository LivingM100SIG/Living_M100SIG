TDD2PC.2DR (TDD2PC.BA) is a M100/102 disk file copy program for use with POWR-DOS and a 2
drive interface using a TDD and a PC running Traveling Software's Booster-Link
(or a similar program) to emulate a second TDD. It could also be used with 2
TDD's. See 2DRIVE.TDD on building a 2 drive interface in this SIG.

The program allows you to copy files from either drive to the other and to
select the files to be copied by using the MS-DOS wildcard characters, * and ?.


SETTING UP:

Connect your 2 drive interface with a TDD on one port and a PC on the other (or
a 2nd TDD). I usually have the TDD on the MOTOROFF side but it doesn't really
matter. What I call the MOTOROFF side is the port on your interface which is
connected when the relay(s) are idle, when the M100 is in the MOTOROFF
condition.

Activate POWR-DOS on your M100.

On the PC, run Booster-Link in the subdirectory you wish to copy files to/from.
This is explained in the Booster-Link manual. The TDD/PC configuration is
especially useful for backing up your TDD disks onto PC 5 1/4" disks.
Booster-Link allows subdirectories, so you can establish 3 subdirectories on a
PC disk and use it as the backup for 3 TDD 100K disks.


RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

Make sure there are no active machine language programs in high memory. It is
best to have only the minimum number of programs in your M100 since TDD2PC.BA
clears all available RAM for use in the copy process. It can only copy files
which can fit in this free RAM area in high memory. For maximum copy space, try
to have only active POWR-DOS and TDD2PC.BA in memory when you are copying.

When run, TDD2PC.BA first asks you to select the drive to copy files from, the
source drive. Enter A or B. A is the MOTOROFF drive and B the MOTORON drive. If
you press ENTER with no input, the program will reset HIMEM to MAXRAM and stop.
You can then return to the main menu if you wish.

Next, the destination drive is checked to see if any files are present. If so,
you can choose whether to delete all of them or not. If you choose not to
delete them, files you select from the source drive will be copied to the
destination drive. Any with the same names will overwrite the ones on the
destination disk and the others will be added.

The source disk is then checked and you are told the number of files on it. You
are then asked to enter a global file name. Anyone familiar with MS-DOS will be
at home with this concept, if not, here's a brief explanation.

The global file name allows you to select which files to copy. In other words,
you set up a filter to allow the copying of only those files whose names have
characters which match your global file name.

* and ? are used as wildcard characters. You construct a global name in the
standard M100 format, a 6 character name, a period and a 2 character extension.
A ? in any position will match any character in that position in the source
file name. The * on either side of the period allows any sequence of characters
to match on that side of the period.

Let's say you enter:  PWR???.BA
Any file starting with PWR and having a BA extension will be copied.

If you enter:  PWR???.*

Any file starting with PWR and having any extension will be copied.

The global name, *.*, is really the same as ??????.??. Use *.* to copy all
files. Or, just press ENTER at the prompt, *.* will be assumed and all files
will be copied.

If you enter less that 6 characters to the left of the period the trailing
characters will be assumed to be spaces. You should enter either 2 characters
or * to the right of the period since spaces are not technically legal in M100
extensions.

Now you have selected the source drive and the files to be copied and TDD2PC.BA
proceeds with the copy operation. Each file name is shown as the file is copied
and the OK prompt returns when the operation is complete. HIMEM is set to
MAXRAM, a MOTOROFF command is issued and MAXFILES is set to 0.

The program include basic remarks to make it easier to follow its flow and make
modifications to suit your needs. These REM's can be removed to save some RAM.
No GOTO's or GOSUB's land on them.

In operation, the program reserves as much high RAM as possible by lowering
HIMEM. It copies each file from the source disk to this area using the POWR-DOS
calls to MAXRAMC+offset and then copies it to the source disk. By not copying
files to low RAM you avoid the problem of program execution stopping when a
BASIC program is loaded into RAM.
