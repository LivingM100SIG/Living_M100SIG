Since Acroatix didn't see fit to include such a list with the package, here's
a complete listing of the files on the Powr-DOS distribution disk.  Not all
of these files will be on every disk; notes indicate the exceptions:

!!!!!!.!!   10207 -- upgrade purchasers only
COPY  .BA    1685
COPY-C.BA    1810
D-TEXT.BA    5522
DMENU .BA    2478
DOS+  .BA    2387 -- this and all "+" files optional
FORMAT.BA     990
MEM+  .DO     466
PAGE+ .DO     646
PL    .BA     498
PREV+ .DO     410
PRFORM.BA    1225
Powr-D_SYS  10207
RECOVR.BA    3501
RFIL+ .DO     657
SELCT+.DO     530
TINY-D.BA    1910 -- part of the DOS+ package


This information is by no means crucial, but I had to carefully read the
program manual to verify that I had everything.  I'm likely more
interested in this than most because my first copy of Powr-Disk was
incomplete.
