  It was while byte-fighting BACKUP.BA for the TDD2 that I noticed the call: 
CALL 62297,X,Y (CALL 58980 for the 200.)

Where X:

 X=1 Format Disk
 X=2 Write to disk
 X=3 Read from disk
 X=5 Seems to check status of disk?

Where Y points to a four byte location:

First two bytes: Location in memory to load or save from.

Third byte: Sector
Forth Byte: Unknown

After the call is executed:

First Byte: Error Codes

 > 1 Then Error
 = 3 Then Drive Not Ready
 = 5 Then I/O Error
 = 6 Then Write protected
 = 8 Then No Disk
 = 9 Then Hard trouble

  I used this call when I wrote SPELL2.CO and I'm sure there are other things 
I'm missing.  FLOPY2 chould become 'THE' Dos for the TDD2
