Would someone be so kind as to upload IPL.BA into library 9? I lost my Tandy
Disk Drive manual, and without it I cannot load FLOPPY.CO.

Unfortunately, IPL.BA is covered by a Tandy Corp. Copyright, and we may not
republish it.  Sorry.

Well, I managed to find a copy of it on cassette. But I still have one problem
- I have no idea what the DIP settings should be when loading FLOPPY.CO, and
when using it. Could you please tell me the settings by friday night?

Dip switches are marked with an OFF position, which is AWAY from the Tandy
label.  To load FLOPPY.CO, turn the drive off, move all four switches to the
ON position.  Turn the drive over, turn it on, insert the utility disk, and
run IPL.BA.

If successful, remove the disk, turn the drive off, turn it over and move all
switches back to the off position, and the drive is then ready for use.

If NOT successful, the low battery light will blink repeatedly.  Turn the
power off, wait ten or fifteen seconds, and try again.



NOTE:  See the file PWR-02.DOC (Lib. 9), which is part of the POWR-DOS manual,
and which provides the IPL program and loading instructions.
