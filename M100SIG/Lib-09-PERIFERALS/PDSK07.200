This program runs a copy of FLOPPY.CO directly from disk, assuming you have
previously saved FLOPPY.CO to the disk.  Although since POWR-DISK is inherently
superior to FLOPPY.CO, I don't know why anyone would want to do so.  The only function that FLOPPY can perform that
POWR-DISK can't, is to copy files from disk to disk. (backups)

Program requires that a copy of FLOPPY.CO and PD-FLP.CO (PDSK09.200) be on the
disk that's loaded in the disk drive.  PD-FLP loads a version of POWR-DISK into
RAM below FLOPPY.CO so that they can both be in RAM at the same time.
