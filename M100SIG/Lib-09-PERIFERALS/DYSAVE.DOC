        This program is designed for those with TMPC and A&J's operating system
co-resident in memory.  I'm sure that it could be easily modified to work on
the various disk systems, or (ugh!) on cassette.

       The program first saves the DIARY.DO file created by TMPC to wafer tape,
then clears the contents of DIARY from memory, except for 3 bytes, then enters
TMPC.

       After that, each time it is run, it reads the DIARY.DO file from wafer,
appends the current DIARY contents from memory to it, clears DIARY contents
from memory, and enters TMPC.

       I run the program every morning to keep as much memory clear in my 100
as possible.  At the beginning of each month, I rename the old wafer DIARY file
as an archive for the past month, and copy DIARY.DO to wafer to start a new
month.

       -Please note that since the A&J currently does not have an "append"
function, I had to read wafer contents into memory, append them there, then
wirite the new file back to wafer.  During the use of the program, about 2K of
free memory is required.  When done, the program deletes the temporary files
created.-

       To use, start a new month by SAVEing DIARY.DO to wafer as a document
file.  Thereafter, just run DYSAVE and everything will take care of itself.

       Hope this helps some of you with memory conservation.
