Software Control of MENU/0MENU
------------------------------

It is sometimes handy to be able to turn the PG Designs MENU/0MENU
utility on and off via software control.  At the simplest level, a
Basic function key can be set-up to turn the MENU utility on.
With a bit more work, it is possible to make programs turn off
0MENU at entry and toggle it back on again at exit; the file
DSKMGR.PGD installs just this type of patch on DSKMGR to make it
function smoothly with 0MENU.

The calls into 0MENU (make sure vers. 2.0+ is installed!) have
been provided by Peter Van Heusden.  They are:

     0MENU Off: CALL 34080

     0MENU On : CALL 32825

For some uses, this information suffices -- but not for all.  Both
of these CALL's take you back to the M100 main menu after they do
their thing.  When starting a program which needs 0MENU off, you
would rather just continue into the program!

Continuing into a program after disabling 0MENU requires a
different approach.  In creating DSKMGR.PGD, I simply replicated
the 25 bytes of code starting at 8520 hex (34080 dec) and leading
to the exit call.  The exit call was replaced by entry to the M/L
program.  The absolute location of the code in memory will depend
upon the program in question and its type (Basic or M/L).  And
there are two relative jumps to be included.

Fortunately, 0MENU is transparent to most applications, and seldom
will require software control.  In fact, DSKMGR is the only
program I've run across needing the turn-off treatment -- and now
it has been treated.  Now to find a way to make Ultimate ROM II
turn 0MENU on at exit!  Hmmmmm.
