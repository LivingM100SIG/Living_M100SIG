  ADDICT.TD2 adds words from the RAM file SUSPEC.DO to the dictionary files
DICT-A.DO thru DICT-Z.DO and is especially written for the Model 100 or
Tandy 200 with the Tandy portable disk drive utilizing either POWR-DISK or
TS-DOS operating systems.
	
  The disk dictionary files must be set-up as described in SPLTD2.DOC.
	
  The file SUSPEC.DO must be set-up as follows (such as listed by SPLCHK.TD2):
    1. The words within the file must be in alphabetical order.
    2. All letters must be in lower-case.
    3. The words must start with a letter and may not contain spaces, but
       may contain a hyphen or appostrophe.
    4. The words must be on seperate lines with no blank lines.
	
  The first thing the program does is verify that all dictionary files exist
and keeps track of what sequential files are on what disk, if multiples disks
are used. Next the program reads the entire dictionary file to be added to
into RAM, placing the new words in order where they belong. Then the new
dictionary file is written back to disk. When using a multi-disk system you
will be prompted when to change disks and you only get one try to get it
right otherwise the whole program must be run again.
	
  When finnished the program returns to the computer's main menu and does not
kill the SUSPEC.DO file so it can be added to back-up dictionary disks.
	
  WARNING: There must be enough free memory in the computer to contain a
complete individual dictionary file in RAM otherwise an Out of Memory error
is displayed and program execution is halted.
