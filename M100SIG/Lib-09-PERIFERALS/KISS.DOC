>>DOCUMENTATION FOR KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE START-UP) - DVI AND CASSETTE<<

Richard K. Helman 70536,1061

Keep It Simple Start-up is two programs designed to run consecutively
after a Cold-Start in order to reload up to three Basic files and as many
ASCII files as desired.  Names are KISS1 AND KISS2.  Loading and saving of
Basic programs is accomplished through the use of the Function Keys on the
Model 100 (numbers 1-7).  KISS1 redefines the function keys to enable loading
and saving of the Basic programs.  Key 7 runs KISS2 which loads ASCII files
and redefines the function keys to either their Cold-Start value (Cassette) or
to DVI useful functions as an option (Disk users).

--CASSETTE--INSTRUCTIONS--
1.  Download KISS.CAS, separating the two files using M100 text-editing
capabilities at line 600.
2.  Convert to Basic files called "KISS1" and "KISS2"
3.  Edit lines 40 through 50 in KISS1 for the names of your particular
programs.  IMPORTANT: The name of the Cassette file in lines 40, 44 and 48
cannot be longer than 5 characters with no extension (.ba).  This is due
to the fact that the maximum for the Key definition has been reached.
However, the name of the RAM file in lines 42, 46 and 50 can be up to 6
characters (no extension).
4.  Csave KISS1 to cassette.
5.  Csave each of the Basic programs called for in lines 40, 44 and 48 on the
same tape after saving KISS1.  Be sure they are saved in the same sequence as
called for in the program.
6.  Edit lines 100-190 in KISS2 for your particular application.  Length of
the filename may be up to 6 characters in this program.  You may enter as many
.DO files as you wish using lines 100-190.  Three examples are given in the
original program which may be changed or deleted.  If you wish to retain the
examples for reference, use a REM statement at the beginning of lines 110-180.
For example, you may wish to add line 130.
         130 DO$="CAS:MYFILE.DO":DD$="MYFILE.DO":GOSUB500
7.  Csave your edited KISS2 to the same cassette following your other saves.
8.  Csave each of the .DO files on the same cassette in the same sequence as
they are called for in lines 100-190.  Rewind tape.
9.  After a Cold-Start or as a test, run KISS doing the following:
    A. Type---RUN"CAS:KISS1 <ENTER>
    B. When the program requests it, press Function Keys F1 through F7 in that
       order.  Cassette users must press all of them before the second BEEP is
       heard.
    C. After the second Beep, KISS will begin executing.  Sit back or go
       have a cup of coffee while it does its work (saves you a lot of work)!
    D. You will be prompted for Date/Day/Time but can ignore the prompt by
       pressing "y" or <ENTER>.

--DVI--INSTRUCTIONS--
1.  Download KISS.DVI, separating the two files using M100 text-editing
capabilities at line 600.
2.  Convert to Basic files called "KISS1" and "KISS2"
3.  Edit lines 40 through 50 in KISS1 for the names of your particular
programs.  Names may be up to 6 characters in length with no extensions (.BA).
4.  Save KISS1 on disk.
5.  Edit lines 100-190 in KISS2 for your particular application.  Length of
the filename may be up to 6 characters.  Three examples are given in the 
original program which may be changed or deleted.  If you wish to retain
the examples for reference, use a REM statement at the beginning of lines
110-180.  For example, you may wish to add line 130.
           130 DO$="0:MYFILE.DO":DD$="MYFILE.DO":GOSUB500
6.  If you do not desire the KEY definitions in lines 200 and 210, you may
remove them or "REM" them and remove the "REM" in line 230...or make your
own definitions.
7.  Save KISS2 to disk using the name "KISS2" with no extension.
8.  Save all files called for in the two programs to disk.  Basic files
called for in KISS1 should have no extension.  DO files called for in KISS2
should have a .DO extension.  Order is not important, just so they are all
available on drive 0.
9.  After a Cold-Start first load Disk Basic into the M100 then procede as
described below.  You can also test the program by performing the following
steps.
    A. Type---RUN"0:KISS1 <ENTER>
    B. When the program requests it, press Function Keys F1 through F7 in that
       order.
    C. Sit back and watch it work (takes just a short time using disk).
    D. You will be prompted for Date/Day/Time but can ignore the prompt by
       pressing "y" or <ENTER>.

--OTHER INFORMATION--
Don't be overly concerned about program length as each program is discarded
after it is run.

The program allows you to load and save 3 Basic files.  If you only want to
load 2, for example, I suggest you modify lines 48 and 50 in KISS1 as follows:
   48 KEY 5,CHR$(13)
   50 KEY 6,CHR$(13)
Don't disturb line 52!

Don't let line 400 in KISS2 stop you.  Use it to run another program if you
wish.  For example, use it to run a machine language program loader.  I use it
to run a program that will make certain files invisible to the Menu.  I am
sure there are all kinds of uses that could be made by calling another
program at line 400.

Hopefully, KISS will make Cold-Starts much less annoying.  Have fun!
