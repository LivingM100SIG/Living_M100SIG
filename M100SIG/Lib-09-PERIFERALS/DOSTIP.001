     Powr-Dos by Acroatix is an invisible file that must be loaded at the 
bottom of BASIC, UNLESS you are running another program that must be loaded 
first, such as Supera or PG design's bank transfer program, in which case Powr-
Dos is loaded afterwards.

     Therefore, one of the first problems a user of Powr-Dos may encounter is:
     HOW THE HECK DO I LOAD SUPERA WITH POWR-DOS, WHEN POWR-DOS HAS TO BE 
LOADED AFTER SUPERA?!

To load Supera from disk with Powr-Dos (instructions must be followed IN THIS 
ORDER):

1)Load Powr-Dos.
2)Load Supera BUT DO NOT TURN IT ON!
3)Load PL.BA
4)Print the command LFILES OFF in BASIC.
5)Turn on Supera.  If the copyright notice appears, all is well.
6)Run PL.BA to re-load POWR-DOS.
