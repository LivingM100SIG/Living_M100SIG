This program, "D100" is an udate of a
program I wrote before for the DVI.
This program is automatic. It switches
the 100 between the Disk basic and the
100 without the disk basic. Also, it 
has a routine that will create a file
called "DDT" that saves the time, day,
and date when one goes back to disk basic.
There is a slight lag between going 
between the "pure" 100 and disk basic,
so my program should be run a second time
after going to disk basic to "Bump" the
time.

If you are in disk basic, the program
will take you our of disk basic and
put you into the Model 100 without
disk basic.
If you are in the state without disk 
basic, the program will put you in disk
basic. This is where the time is lost 
and my routine restores it, if you run
the program a second time to "BUMP" the
time
