  SPLCHK.TD2 is a spell check program written for the M100 or T200 with the
Tandy portable disk drive and utilizing POWR-DISK or TS-DOS operating systems.
	
  The disk dictionary files may be on one or more disks, but must be set-up
as follows:
  1. Each disk may contain one or many dictionary files, but they must be
     sequential.
  2. The files must be named DICT-A.DO thru DICT-Z.DO with only words starting
     with that letter within the file.
  3. The words within the files must be in alphabetical order, all letters must
     be lower-case, must be on seperate lines with no blanks, and must not
     contain spaces but may contain a hyphen or appostrophe as long as they
     are not the first character of the word.
	
  The first thing the program does is verify that all dictionary files exist
and keeps track of what sequential files exist on what disk number, if multiple
disks are utilized. Next the program displays all active, visible files and
prompts for the file to be checked (.DO extension is optional). This must be a
file in RAM that has been prepared by the machine language program loaded by
DCPREP.
	
  When using a multiple disk dictionary you will be prompted when to change
disks. The program will tell you which disk number to insert. You will only
get one chance to do it right, otherwise, the program will have to be
started over again.
	
  Any words in the test file that are not found in the dictionary files will
be copied into the RAM file named SUSPEC.DO for later review. When all
test words have been checked the original test file will be killed and the
program will return to the computer's main menu.

						Good Luck & Good Spelling
