ERRATA for M100/102 only.
-------------------------
Many Model 100/102 users have come across a conflict when trying to load
or use RAMDSK.CO with FLOPPY (Tandy's TDD2 disk manager) installed.  Go into
BASIC and PRINT MAXRAM.  If MAXRAM is 60000 then FLOPPY is installed.  The
following instructions will convert FLOPPY to FLOPP2.CO and permit
RAMDSK.CO to be used when needed.

You cannot simply rename FLOPPY to FLOPP2.CO.  You have to convert it,
as follows:

1) With FLOPPY uninstalled, boot FLOPPY as usual (see TDD2 instruction manual).

2) Goto BASIC and run this program:

 10 POKE 62116,154:POKE 62117,249
 20 POKE 62118,0
 30 SAVEM"FLOPP2",60003,62700,60003

3) FLOPP2.CO should be on the menu but before you use it, run FREMEM.BA to get
rid of FLOPPY (use FLOPP2.CO to load FREMEM.BA from disk).

4) After running FREMEM and uninstalling FLOPPY you can kill FREMEM.BA and
begin to use FLOPP2.CO exactly as you would use FLOPPY.  Save FLOPP2.CO to
the Datapac for backup.

5) RAMDSK.CO can now be loaded or used as needed.

6) With RAMDSK.CO and FLOPP2.CO in RAM, here is a BASIC utility that will
allow you to select between them.

0 REM DISK.BA (C) 1990 BY P.GLOBMAN
1 CLS:PRINT@50,"1 - FLOPPY DISK"
2 PRINT@90,"2 - NODE RAMDISK"
3 PRINT@170," Esc/Select =>":X$=INKEY$

5 IFX$="2"THENCLEAR99,61681:RUNM"RAMDSK
6 IFX$=CHR$(27)THENMENUELSE3

This program can also be used with the original FLOPPY.CO (TDD1) if line 4 is
changed to:

4 IFX$="1"THENCLEAR99,59400:RUNM"FLOPPY
