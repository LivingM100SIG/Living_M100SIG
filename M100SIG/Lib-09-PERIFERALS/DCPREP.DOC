    DCPREP.LDR is a program which loads a machine language prep program
anywhere in memory.  This prep program takes a document file in RAM, strips
the words within the file, throws out duplicate words & sorts the word list.
This is all done within the specified RAM file in preparation of running a
spelling-checker. As you should be able to surmise the original RAM file will
be destroyed, so unless your just trying to build up your dictionary, you
will want to back-up the file before running the m/l program on it.
    DCPREP.LDR will not allow you to load over memory above MAXRAM, but
gives you the option of loading over locations above HIMEM and will reset
HIMEM to protect the m/l program being loaded. It also optionally allows you
to define a function key to run the m/l program that will remain resident in
your M100 until a cold-start is performed or until HIMEM is set above the
start location or until another program writes over its locations.
    Once DCPREP.LDR is run it can be killed, remembering to keep a back-up
in case you have to re-load. The m/l program can be run either by using the
defined function key or by calling its start location. WARNING: Because of
the nature of the routines called by the m/l program, it CANNOT be called
from within a Basic program.
