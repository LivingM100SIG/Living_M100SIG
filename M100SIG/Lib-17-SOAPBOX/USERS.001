         PHILIP FRANK,
         PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA
             Philip Frank initially bought a NEC PC-8201 to teach
         himself BASIC, a goal he continues to work toward today.
         Meanwhile, he's been pleasantly surprised by the computer's
         versatility, particularly since he added Ultimate ROM II
         from Traveling Software.
             Frank reports that he used the 8201 constantly during
         three years of on-the-road systems analysis and
         productivity-improvement consulting, when he found the
         computer "indispensable for telecommunications."
             When the traveling became tiresome, Frank gave it up to
         take a job coordinating meetings for the University of
         Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "I don't really miss the
         traveling I did on my old job, but I do kind of miss getting
         messages on the 8201," says Frank.
             At Wharton, Frank deals with corporations coming to give
         lectures, secures meeting rooms, contacts the appropriate
         professors and arranges catering services. The 8201 has
         taken a back seat at his new job, where he uses it only
         occasionally as a peripheral to his desktop computer. But
         the laptop still figures prominently in the businesses he
         runs from his home, where he uses it with an Epson HX-80 to
         write business letters and print invoices.
             "I handle mailing lists for guest houses in the
         Philadelphia area," says Frank. "Since most of them don't
         like to relinquish their registration books, I need to do
         on-site data entry. In enter all the names and addresses on
         my 8201 and dump the data to my desktop when I get home."
             When he's not coordinating meetings or working on
         guest-house mailing lists, Frank is cooking up a new
         project: He's hoping to sell templates that go with stock
         databases that would set up reservation and registration
         systems for guest houses. "I've already completed one
         template for the Apple II," Frank says. "And I'm working on
         another for IBM-compatibles."
         
         PHILIP CARACENA
         COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
             Philip Caracena, Ph.D. gets called away from his private
         psychotherapy practice more and more lately. Carrying one of
         his two Model 100s, he visits recently-hospitalized
         psychiatric patients to administer a variety of diagnostic
         tests at the request of the patients' treatment teams.
             "Treatment planning meetings happen quickly after a
         psychiatric patient is admitted," explains the clinical
         psychologist. "The patients are in there for acute reasons,
         so the team needs information fast. I administer
         psychological tests, enter the scores on the 100 and send
         them over TELCOM to an interpretive service."
             Caracena's use of a computer in his psychological work
         is part of a growing trend. "There's a movement in the field
         toward using straight computer testing without complementing
         the data with subjective observations," says Caracena, who
         feels strongly that such tests should not be given by
         untrained people. "The human factor is important in giving
         psychological tests," he explains. "Psychological tests have
         limitations. Many statements they make apply to a group, but
         a variety of additional factors must be considered when
         testing an individual."






             Caracena incorporates the results sent back to him into
         reports he writes on the Model 100. "I get fast results for
         people who need fast consultations," he says. He hopes that
         his fast turn-around time will keep him competitive with
         others who provide computer-administered tests without the
         context of a complete report.
             One of Caracena's favorite tests is the Rorschach ink
         blot test, in which people look at an ink blot and say what
         they see. While psychologists' interpretations of their
         clients' responses used to be very subjective, says
         Caracena, now the test is much more empirical. "A
         psychologist used a computer extensively to compile test
         results and to improve the scoring system," he says.
             Caracena records patients' responses with a character
         set of 25 or 30 numbers and symbols. Meaningless by
         themselves, when sent to an interpretive service in
         Minneapolis via TELCOM the responses can be compared with
         thousands of test results whose subjects have known
         psychological characteristics.
             Caracena finds this testing method to be so useful that
         he's working on a manual for its use which he hopes to
         publish within the next year. Part of the effort, he says,
         is to "find better ways to assemble consultation reports."
         He hopes that psychologists like himself who invent or use
         computerized tests don't use the computers' responses
         perfunctorily, but remember to incorporate the computer
         feedback creatively into treatment programs.
             An ex-ham radio operator, Caracena says the Model 100
         also meets some of his hobbying needs. "The 100 is a hobby
         in itself," he says. "It's a game to see how far I can
         stretch its use." He's pushing the machine's limits by
         trying various programs and games, and keeping up with new
         products.
             Caracena doesn't anticipate outgrowing his 100 until he
         intensifies efforts in his Rorschach manual-writing project
         this summer. Meanwhile, he has an IBM-PC compatible desktop
         computer that sits quietly in his house, collecting dust.
         
         WALTER SCOTT & KAREN MORTON
         KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE
             You may remember Dr. Bunson Honeydew and his assistant
         Beaker from the Muppets, the stars of public television's
         Sesame Street who went on to Hollywood box-office fame.
         Namesakes of Honeydew and Beaker reside in the Knoxville
         home of Walter Scott. The Knoxville Beaker -- who looks a
         lot like a Model 100 -- assists Scott in telling Dr.
         Honeydew -- who looks a lot like a Heath H-8 minicomputer --
         how to adjust his home control program.
             "Dr. Honeydew wakes me up in the morning, turns the heat
         on in the bathroom about 10 minutes before I need to use it,
         and starts the coffee maker. He checks the mailbox and tells
         me when mail has arrived, alerts me to the arrival of
         visitors at our front gate, controls the air conditioning,
         and reminds me of birthdays and anniversaries," explains
         Scott.
             Beaker accompanies Scott and wife Karen D. Morton on
         their frequent business and recreational travels. Dr.
         Honeydew stays home, of course, turning lights on and off to
         deter potential house thieves. Scott utilizes Beaker's
         telecommunications abilities to tell Dr. Honeydew when to






         turn on lights or air conditioning for their arrival back
         home.
             Beaker serves many other purposes, says Scott, an
         electrical engineer with the Tennessee Valley Authority.
         Scott's current focus at work is the Atmospheric Fluidized
         Bed Combustion Demonstration Project; that is, he's helping
         design a coal-fired power plant that will burn
         high-sulphur-content coal efficiently and cleanly, without
         the need for expensive scrubbers. "I use Beaker for writing
         memos and for a lot of the tedious number-punching in my
         programming design work," explains Scott. Uploading data
         from the 100 is far more cost-efficient than entering it
         directly into the TVA's Chattanooga mainframe, he adds.
             "For technical writing," says Scott, "I use the 100
         almost exclusively." Scott takes notes on Beaker in business
         meetings. "Nobody has objected to my using the 100 in
         meetings," Scott says, "but I do get some raised eyebrows.
         Some guys tease me about taking notes that way, but a couple
         have been inspired to get their own laptop computers."
             Beaker has a counterpart Model 100 named Cassandra that
         accompanies Karen Morton, a programmer and technician who
         works with dBASE II. Cassandra isn't much help in dBASE II
         programming, but does earn her keep at home, where Morton
         uses her for writing science fiction.
             Married about a year ago, the couple had met at -- you
         guessed it -- a computer users group meeting. "The computers
         are our kids," says Scott, who claims that Dr. Honeydew
         hasn't misbehaved in a couple of years. "We're very pleased
         with our computers -- and very dependent on them. Honeydew's
         system has been evolving since about 1981. He runs
         continuously now, doing about 16 different tasks. A few
         years ago he turned the lights out when I was outside at
         night, and once he turned on the air conditioning on just
         about the coldest day in winter. Otherwise, he hasn't been
         any trouble at all."
         
         RICHARD WENER
         MAPLEWOOD, NEW JERSEY
             Consulting environmental psychologist Richard Wener
         researches the influence of physical design on people living
         or working in various types of spaces. His clients include
         jails and prisons that have incorporated a new type of
         architecture called "direct supervision." These innovative
         designs eliminate the need for bars, glass or cement block
         walls that separate inmates from the officials supervising
         them. The new designs often resemble dormitory rooms that
         open onto group living areas and facilities. Supervisory
         staff members mingle with inmates in these communal living
         areas.
             "You might expect that the staff would be at risk in
         such a setting," says Wener, "but my observations indicate
         otherwise. The innovative designs encourage better
         communication between inmates and officials. With the proper
         training provided to jail and prison officials, the level of
         tension, violence and vandalism in these modern facilities
         is significantly less than in conventionally designed
         institutions."
             To aid in his research, Wener uses his Model 100 with a
         program of his own devising that allows him to code
         behaviors and types of physical spaces. "I can use a code to






         note what someone is doing and where he is doing it,"
         explains Wener. "The 100 stores and analyzes this
         information."
             Wener can then use the data in several ways. "I can
         print out the raw data, cross-tabulate behaviors by types of
         physical spaces, or look at the range of behaviors that
         occur in a particular type of space."
             Wener has yet to introduce the 100's role in research to
         the graduate students he teaches at Polytechnical University
         in Brooklyn, New York. "I only have one Model 100," he says,
         "and it's fully loaded with data." He hopes to purchase
         several more laptops soon for teaching purposes.
             The 100 does go with him to the school's library for
         taking notes, as well as on plane trips and to other
         consulting jobs he does for private companies. "Employees in
         large firms usually have no control over designing their own
         work space," Wener says. "My job there is to interview
         employees, observe how they work and get them to participate
         in redesigning their own work environment."
             When using his Model 100 on the road, Wener sometimes
         finds himself the object of other people's behavioral
         observations. "The 100 is a good conversation starter on
         planes and trains," notes the psychologist, "although it's
         becoming less of a phenomenon as laptops become more
         popular."
         
         DENNY THOMAS
         HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA
             Denny Thomas, an electrical engineer at Capitol Records'
         Hollywood headquarters, discovered the Model 100 after
         getting burned out on 10 years of high-pressure professional
         programming at the mainframe level. "This would be a cute
         little guy to mess around with," he thought when he saw a
         100 on sale about a year and a half ago. He bought the
         machine, obtained a subscription to CompuServe and has been
         a Model 100 zealot ever since.
             Thomas joined Capitol's crew of engineers to help build,
         repair and maintain the company's three recording studios,
         six editing rooms and two disc mastering rooms. When the
         manufacturer of Capitol's minicomputer showed him how they
         run diagnostics using the Epson Geneva laptop computer as a
         terminal, Thomas caught on quickly and wrote similar
         utilities on a Model 102. "Instead of buying a Geneva, which
         I consider a useless machine, I rewrote the diagnostic
         programs on the machine I was already familiar with." Thomas
         also uses the 102 to write technical manuals for Capitol's
         complex CD equipment.
             Two Model 100s keep Thomas busy at home. "I use one with
         a Chipmunk disk drive as a desktop computer for programming
         and for communicating with CompuServe and several bulletin
         boards," he explains. The other goes with him in his
         briefcase, along with a Tandy Portable Disk Drive. "The
         Tandy (disk drive) is a better deal than the Chipmunk for
         travel because it weighs less," opines Thomas.
             Thomas serves on the Club 100 BBS advisory board, where
         he's working to get permission from programmers to upload
         their work. His vast experience with the 100s allows him to
         assume what he calls "a guru posture" on the BBS -- he helps
         out others more than he receives assistance himself -- and
         mostly he does it, he says, because it's a lot of fun.






             Thomas dreams of becoming self-employed. But expanding
         his horizons in the music field would probably mean moving
         to Nashville, New York, Los Angeles or perhaps London --
         moves he wouldn't relish. "And I can't get excited anymore
         about the mainframe environment," he says, after having
         looked into learning higher-level languages in order to
         qualify for corporate programming projects.
             Programming for laptops, on the other hand, has captured
         his interest: "The challenge is to make them do something
         that doesn't seem possible, to create software like
         Traveling Software's T-Word, which I think is the best word
         processor on the planet."
             Thomas says he misses the creativity involved in
         programming. "Previously, I did my own system analyses,
         wrote and researched my own applications, assembled whole
         packages. That was back in 1975 when no standards like Lotus
         [1-2-3] existed. I'm more interested in doing the whole
         system than just nuts and bolts." So what holds him back?
         "The idea of starving," he laughs.
         
         A. ALAN POUND
         LILBURN, GEORGIA
             What does Alan Pound do with his laptop? "It would be
         easier to tell you what I don't do with it," he replies. A
         salesman with a nationwide organization of manufacturers'
         representatives, Pound lists at least 20 tasks he
         accomplishes with his 100 before I can't keep up with him.
         "It's my notepad, alarm clock, typewriter, telephone book,
         calendar... It's sitting on my lap right now. I was just
         entering some personal expenses when you called," he says.
             Pound rarely pulls the 100 out of his briefcase during a
         sales call, since his hunt-and-peck typing style interferes
         with maintaining eye contact with his customers. "I'll only
         take it out to check my schedule or consult a customer's
         file," he explains.
             Outside the customer's office, however, the 100 is
         almost always at his fingertips. "I have 20 years of
         experience selling," says Pound, "and for 17 of them I wrote
         lots of notes that got lost. I couldn't keep track of
         customers' orders, phone numbers, addresses or anything
         else. That inspired me to get into computing."
             His goal in purchasing the Model 100 three years ago was
         "to look like I'm always in an organized office, even though
         I spend two to three days a week on the road.  With the 100,
         I think I've come close to achieving that. I'm much more
         organized now -- though some people might dispute that!"
             About a year ago Pound left his sales position to become
         his own boss, and now he feels a need to be more organized
         than ever. "The Model 100 has helped me to survive that
         move," he says.
