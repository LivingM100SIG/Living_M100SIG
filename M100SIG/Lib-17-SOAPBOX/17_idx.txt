  Copy of a letter to the editor I sent to 80 Micro protesting their
  treatment of non-MS-DOS Tandy owners, and laptoppers in general, such as
  dropping laptop coverage without notifying us and not telling anyone how to
  cancel their  subscriptions when 80 Micro went MS-DOS only.

  This set of messages starts up where the thread FUTURE.THD left off,
  under the topic "Laptop Brain Drain".  Views on the impact of the upcoming
  Tandy MS-DOS laptop on the future of the Kyocera (M100/102/200) are
  presented. This is not the first THD file on this, nor the last.  After

  The future of the Model 100 family is always of interest to members of
  this Forum.  A recent thread in the IBMHW Forum started with the premise
  that the soon-to-be-released Toshiba T1000 will "kill the Model 100".
  Doubtful -- but clearly machines which approach the Model 100/102 in weight
  and size, with much more power, are on the way.  These messages discuss the
  future of the Model 100.

  Talks in general terms about designing a new ROM for the M100/102 --
  either to replace the current chip, or to work in the optROM socket.
  Describes some difficulties in re-tooling current software to run from an
  optROM, and gives some insight on how Mike Nugent fixed the notorious M100
  date bug.
  This thread is high on idea content, a little sparse on technical detail.
