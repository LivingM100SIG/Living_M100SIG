Dear Editors:

I am writing to express my disappointment in your treatment of Tandy laptop 
computer  owners.   You  never  actually notified us that you  had  stopped 
covering  our computers until a cryptic comment in the November issue  that 
mentioned that you had "picked up and discarded" the Model 100 family.

Since  that was news to me,  I grabbed the top handful of magazines off  my 
pile of back issues,  and went through them one-by-one,  starting with  May 
1986,  which  featured  a Model 100 on the cover.   Each of the  next  four 
issues  had  at  least  one review and/or  feature  article  featuring  the 
portables  and products for them.   The September 1986 issue didn't mention 
the portables in the "battle plan," but there was no mention that they were 
being dropped, either.

Sure  enough,  in  at least eight of the next twelve issues (I  don't  know 
about  the  June 1987 issue because there was  a  subscription  fulfillment 
problem.   When I notified you,  I was told I would be receiving the issue, 
but several weeks later I was told I wouldn't,  and I didn't.),  there were 
either  Express Checkouts,   New Product  announcements,   Reviews,  and/or 
articles about the Model 100 family.   Two others had Model 100 information 
in  the Feedback Loop section,  though I would expect that to be  the  case 
even if the portables were formally dropped elsewhere.    Even the December  
1987 issue had a Model 100-related New Product announcement.

You obviously didn't notify the advertisers,  either, as Model 100-specific 
ads appeared in at least every issue through September 1987.

You  also  did not tell your readers who don't own MS-DOS computers how  to 
cancel their subscription and get a refund for unmailed issues.   This hurt 
the TRSDOS owners, as well.  All in all, we have just witnessed some of the 
most  irresponsible actions by a magazine that I am aware of.   Considering 
how valuable 80 Micro has been to its readers, it is quite a shock.

Enclosed  is  the copy of the January 1987 issue which is  useless  to  me.  
Please promptly refund the last six months of my subscription.

Sincerely,



Neil Smith

PS   I  am  also disappointed that the TRS-80  Support  Monthly  Newsletter 
advertised in the January 1987 Classifieds,  is not included in the list of 
1/III/4 magazines on page 8 of the same issue,  as I assume that's where it 
belongs.
