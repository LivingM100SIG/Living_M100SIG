	Millipede! is a machine language game based on "Centipede".  You start
with 5 missile launchers, but earn an extra one every 100 points.
	Use the left & right arrow keys to move your launcher, and press
the spacebar to fire.  Your score is displayed in the lower left corner of
the screen, and the number of millipedes you have killed is displayed in the
lower right corner.  The game gets tougher as you kill more of them.  My
best score  is 417.  Press CONTROL-X to exit the game at any time.
	MILLIP.SRC should be a text file named OBJT.DO, and MILLIP.LDR is a
Basic program.  Run the Basic program to create MP.CO, then delete OBJT.DO and
the Basic program.
	MP.CO is less than 1400 bytes long, and is located just below
BOUNCE.CO, which is also available from SIG Access.  The loader program sets
HIMEM to 60400.  If you run a program that sets HIMEM (the second number in a
CLEAR statement) to a value higher than that, it will almost certainly bomb
Millipede!.  Running MP.CO may then kill all your files!  If you want to save
the game on cassette, save OBJT.DO and the loader program.  I haven't gotten
good results saving MP.CO directly.
	Millipede! was assembled using M. Henning's ASM.100.  The loader
program was adapted from his LDASM.100.
