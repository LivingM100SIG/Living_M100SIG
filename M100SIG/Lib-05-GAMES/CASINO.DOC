     CASINO.DOC  by Don Zeikel 75775,1430

     This is the companion file to CASINO.CA.  It includes instructions on how 
to download the program.

     To run CASINO.CA, you MUST have a Lucid ROM installed and operating on 
your Model 100.  For purposes of these instructions, I will assume that you 
have learned the basics of running a program on Lucid.

     You also must have the program CHANGE.BA by Rick Perry, from DL4.

     CASINO.CA has three separate programs built into one .CA sheet:

       1) An Executive Decision Maker.
           A simple "Yes/No" picker.

       2) A pair of dice.
           They roll and the total is
           printed out.

       3) A roulette layout.
            Very elementary (No black/
            red or "0" and "00"), but it
            selects a number, marks it
            with a "%", and prints it.

     This program has a few good points:
       1)  The directory at A1 makes use of the "bounce" feature; several 
programs can be moved to with the ">" command, and a second press of the ">" 
returns you to the directory.

       2)  All three programs make use of the TBL feature.

       3)  Since I didn't use "$" on any of the cell references, the three 
programs can be copied (or cut) and pasted onto another sheet, as long as each 
program is kept in its entirety.  The Ranges are:  

         Decision Maker - A7:H11
         Dice - A15:K22
         Roulette - L25:Y37

       4)  It is a good test of the capability to upload and download .CA 
sheets.

           TO LOAD THE PROGRAM:

     1)  Save ANY files you don't want to lose on cassette.  There is a 
possibility of a cold start with any machine language loading.

     2)  Download the hex file CASINO.CA.  Delete any extraneous carriage 
returns or characters at the beginning and end of the program.

     3) Save the file to tape, in case of a cold start.

     4)  KILL any machine language programs, and CLEAR 0, MAXRAM.

     5)  Run CHANGE.BA.  Position the cursor over the text file you have 
downloaded from CASINO.CA.

     6)  Press F2 ("BIN").  At the prompt ".CO output file" enter "Casino".
     7)  It will start loading the program.  This takes over three minutes; get
a cup of coffee.

     8)  At the prompt "Kill hex input file?"  Type "Y".  You are done with the
text file (and you have it on tape, if needed).  If, for some reason, you want 
to keep it, type "N".

     9)  You will see a new file on the menu, "CASINO.CO".  Position the cursor
over this, and press F3 ("CA").

     10)  That's IT!  Exit to menu, and you can treat CASINO.CA like any .CA 
sheet that you had created.

     Many custom written spreadsheets contain confidential information.  
Perhaps this idea of writing recreational sheets with techniques we have 
discovered (such as the directory I used in this program) will be one way to 
share uses of this exciting new tool.
     I'd appreciate any comments and suggestions.
