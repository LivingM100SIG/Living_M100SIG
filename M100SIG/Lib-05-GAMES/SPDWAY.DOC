You have played Turbo, Pole Position, Night Driver, and you did well. But now 
comes the ultimate challenge...
--------THE CRAZY MONTY SPEEDWAY-------
First...download this file (SPDWAY.DOC) and then download (SPDWAY.100). Get 
your Spdway.100 into a basic file.  Then go to the menu (F8) and go to TEXT, it
will ask you for a file name. Type "SCORE" (do not write the quotes!) the 
cursor will appear, simply type 0, and hit return, you have now established 
your hi score file, unless you delete it or damage it in anyway, you do not 
have to ever access this file or change it again!
Next, how to play: Use left and right arrows to steer, and up and down arrows 
to to speed up and slow down. You may also use A and L to steer left and right,
which I find far easier to use. If you have knowledge of how the Inkey$ 
function works, then you can easily change the key settings to what you wish.
The object of the game is to drive as long as you can without crashing, as you 
drive the road will slowly get narrowed and your speed will climb, you can 
control your speed up until your score reaches 150.
When this happens you hit "TURBO" and you go maximum speed, you cannot slow 
down here.  At 200 is the real tough part. You have to see just how narrow that
road can get!
My high honestly is only 209, one short of the maximum of 210, once you reached
210 you have achieved Crazy Monty status.  Please tell me when you have done 
it. Once you have achieved it, you may modify the program to go longer, it is 
not hard to do. Important: You can only receive Crazy Monty Status if you 
choose to take one life only, taking greater than one life is okay, but it wont
earn you Crazy Monty Status.
Suggestion/comments/criticisms welcome-Seth Kaplan[72256,744]. Please note this
program is made in mind that many people only have 8K, it is small yet 
entertaining, enough to have something to play but leave enough room for 
serious business.
