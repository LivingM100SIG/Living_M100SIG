===== RULES FOR CRIBGE.BA1 =====
 
     CRIBGE.BA is a two-handed Cribbage game between the Model 100 (referred to
as "I" on the display) and the player ("you").  A game is won by whoever
reaches 121 points at any point in the game.
 
     You and the M100 DRAW for the deal, the lowest card dealing.  Ace is
always low and King high.  After the shuffle (which takes 13-15 sec.), six
cards are dealt alternately to each the non-dealer and dealer.  Both DISCARD
two of these cards into the CRIB (which always belongs to the dealer), trying
to keep a good Hand while discarding "good" cards (if it's your Crib) or "bad"
cards (if not your Crib).  The M100 discards first (29-31 sec.) then you
discard by pressing the number above the cards you select.  The non-dealer then
cuts for the STARTER, which the dealer turns up.  If the Starter is a Jack
("HIS HEELS") the dealer scores 2 points.  The Starter is not used during play
of hands.
 
----- PLAY OF HANDS:
 
     The non-dealer always PLAYs the first card (the M100 prompts show whose
play it is) then the dealer plays and you alternate play thereafter.  The total
of the cards played is displayed on the bootom left corner of the screen.  [Ace
always counts one point, "T"(10) and Face cards count ten and the numbered
cards count their face value.]  The total of the cards played must not exceed
31 (the M100 won't let you play such cards).  If all of your cards would bring
the total to over 31, you must press "G" (for GO).  After one player GOes, the
other must play any cards which stay under or equal 31.  The cards played are
then withdrawn and play begins again until no cards remain unplayed.  The
player who called GO plays first.
 
----- POINTS DURING PLAY OF HANDS:
 
     FIFTEEN - if then card played brings the Total to 15, 2 points are scored.
 
     PAIRS - if the card matches the rank of the last card played, score 2
points.
 
     TRIPLET - if the card matches the rank of the last two cards played (i.e.
a pair), score 6 points (three pairs).
 
     FOUR - if the card matches the rank of the last three cards played (i.e. a
triplet), score 12 points (six pairs).
 
     RUNS - if the card played and the cards previously played form a sequence
in rank of at least three, score 1 point for each card in the run.  Examples:
 
 J 9 T --> 3-card run (Nine Ten Jack)
 
 4 3 A 5 2 --> 5-card run (if the first five cards played, these would count 5
points for the run and 2 points for the 15 play total, a 7 point score)
 
 4 5 6 5 7 --> 3-card run (Five Six Seven - the first 5 stops the run - there
are no double runs in the play of hands)
 
 A K J Q --> 3-card run (Jack Queen King - face cards, though counting 10
points each, still must be considered by rank for runs; the Ace is always 1 and
never counts in runs with face cards)
 
     LAST CARD & 31 - the last card in a GO scores 1 point (if the play total
equals 31 then 2 points are scored)
 
     DEAD CARD - if you press GO when still able to play cards without going
over 31, then when you play those cards the M100 disallows them and scores 2
points for each
 
----- SCORING OF HANDS & CRIB:
 
     The non-dealer's hand is always scored first, then then dealer's hand and
last the crib.  Unlike scoring during play, you must enter the scores of your
hands.  If you enter too high a score, the M100 lets you know.  On the third
try the M100 scores for you - this is strictly against etiquette but is useful
for learning Cribbage.  If you forget to score any points, after your score is
entered the M100 will diplay "MUGGINS" and score the points you overlooked.  Be
sure to find your error before continuing.  (The blinking down arrow means
"Press any key to continue").  The Starter is included in counting each hand
and the crib, so each consists of 5 cards.
 
     FIFTEENS - each combination adding up to 15 scores two points.
 
 7 3 K 5 8 --> 7+8 scores 2, K+5 scores 2, and 7+3+5 scores 2, for 6 total
 
     PAIRS - each pair scores 2 points.
 
 Q Q Q 3 Q --> 1st & 2nd Queen, 1st & 3rd, 1st & 4th, 2nd & 3rd, 2nd & 4th and
3rd & 4th Queen each score 2 points, totalling 12 points (four of a kind -
triplets score 6 points)
 
     RUN - as in scoring during play, except that multiple runs are allowed.
 
 J 9 9 T 4 --> a double run, scores 2 runs of three each (1st Nine Ten Jack
scores 3 points, and 2nd Nine Ten Jack scores another 3 for a total of 6
points; the pair of 9s scores 2 for a total of 8 points for the hand)
 
 2 3 1 3 3 --> a triple run, scores 15 including runs & pairs
 
 T J J T Q --> a double double run scores 16 including run & pairs
 
     FLUSH - if all four cards in the hand are the same suit then 4 points are
scored; if the Starter is the same suit then 1 more point is scored; in the
Crib the flush cards must match the Starter so only 5 points can be scored
 
     HIS NOBS - if a Jack in the hand or crib matches the suit of the Starter,
then 1 point is scored
 
 5 5 J 5 5 --> (where the Jack is "His Nobs") scores 29 points, the highest
possible score (12 points for 6 pairs, 16 points for 8 fifteens & 1 point for
Nobs)
 
     "NINETEEN" - it is impossible to score 19 points, so Cribbage players say
"nineteen" to signify zero points (25, 26 & 27 are also impossible scores)
 
----- END OF HAND & GAME
 
     After scoring, three function keys are available: press F1 to see the Deck
as it was when the hand was dealt; F4 toggles the Sound on & off; and F8 quits
the game.  The deal alternates with each hand.  After a GAME is won by reaching
121 points, the loser deals the first hand of the next game.  If the loser
fails to reach 61 points, then he/she/it(!) is LURCHED and the winner wins 2
games instead of 1.  I've found that playing a match of, say, 3 games out of 5
is more likely to bring your skill to the fore than fewer games.
 
Hope you enjoy playing CRIBGE!
