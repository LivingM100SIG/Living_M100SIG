Casino Blackjack was designed to simulate the quarter blackjack machines at
Las Vegas.  It features graphic display of the cards using the Model 100
character set.  There is one deck of cards which is shuffled when less than 40
cards remain.  The dealer must hit on 16 and stay on 17.  If the dealer has a
soft 17 he must hit ( a soft 17 means an ace is used with a value of 11 to 
reach the 17 score).  You may double down ( double your bet and get only one
hit ) if you have a score of 10 or 11.  If the dealer is showing an ace you
will be asked if you want insurance, which is half of your bet.  If the dealer
has a blackjack you lose nothing, otherwise you lose your insurance money.  The
program plays just like the Vegas machines accept splitting is not supported.
Have fun.
