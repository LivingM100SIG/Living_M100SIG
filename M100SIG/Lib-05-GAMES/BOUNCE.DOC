	BOUNCE by Mike Berro [75765,374]

	BOUNCE is my first venture into assembly language on the Model 100.
As such it is fairly crude.  I used M. Henning's excellent assembler (in
XA 4) to assemble it, and the loader program (BOUNCE.LDR) is adapted from
his LDASM.100.  Since the program is in Basic, there is not much room for the
source code, so this program has as many features as I could fit.  Besides, it
takes 28 minutes to assemble each time!
	As soon is I find a machine language assembler I'll work on 
STARFIGHTER.

Loading the Game
----------------

	Download BOUNCE.SRC and call it BOUNCE.DO.  Download BOUNCE.LDR.  This
program takes the data from BOUNCE.DO and pokes it into memory.  The prgram
starts at D000 (53248) and is 970 bytes long.  I don't know what will happen
if you already have a program there, so don't do it if you can't afford lose
anything.  BACKUP YOUR FILES BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING.  <<< I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR COLD STARTS! >>>

Playing The Game
----------------

	The object is to score the most points in 60 seconds.  There is 1 ball
and you have one paddle.  A hit is worth 1 point normally, or 2 points during
"bonus time".  A miss costs 1 point, although you can't go below zero.
	The title page appears first. Press any key to get to the game.  The
playing field (such as it is) will then appear.  The number in the upper right
is your score.  Below that is the high
score.  In the lower right corner is the time remaining.  The dollar sign near
the score means to press the space bar to begin play.
	The paddle is positioned using the top row of keys.  The ESC key moves
the paddle all the way to the left, the zero key all the way to the right.  The

ball always starts from the same place, so it is possible to remember the
correct sequence for an almost unlimited game.
	After four consecutive hits you are in bonus time. The clock stops, and

all hits count two points.  Bonus time ends the first time you miss the ball.
Also, the paddle shrinks, eventually disappearing entirely.  When you miss
and are back on normal time, the paddle returns to normal.
	If you beat the high score, enter two initials.  If not the cursor
will appear next to the time remaining. Press the space bar to prepare for the
next game.
	Press CONTROL-X anytime except when entering initials to return to
the menu.
