Documentation for WRDSCH.100

	Though adapted specifically
for the TRS-80 CGP-115 printer, this
Wordsearch Puzzle generator should
work on any printer that can handle
the width. If color change is not
wanted &/or not possible, delete all
CHR$(29). It was re-written in order
to generate many different puzzles
with the same word list.
	Words of your choice are to be
entered in DATA lines 8-10. They must
be in CAPITAL letters, though lines
98 to 105 will list them in lower case.
Change DIM statements **AND** necessary
lines 98 to 105 if you use more/less
than 23 words.
	On Run, screen will list back
your words in lower case for you to
check spelling errors. It then takes
about 15 minutes to think & print one
puzzle. It will then start over & print
another DIFFERENT puzzle using the
same words. Listing of words under the
puzzle will be in alphabetical order
no matter how they are listed in the
DATA lines 8-10.
	Am not at all satisfied with
lines 98-105; suggestions for a better
way to get the same result welcome.
