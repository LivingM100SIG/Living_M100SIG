      LIFE 2 :The Conflict
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   This game is based on Life.100.  To play you MUST be familiar with the rules
presented in Life.doc.

   This game (which is based on a game in the book "Basic Computer Games" by 
Creative Computing) brings a new dimension to the game of life.  TWO people 
play, each placing his "organisms" on the board so as to "kill off" the other 
player's oganisms by overcrowding or isolation.  This game illustrates the 
"genetic competition" for survival among all forms of life.

       THE RULES:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. All previous rules from Life.100 apply.
2. The playing field is a 5x5 grid.
3. Each player has a special symbol for his or her organisms.
4. On the first move each player is asked to enter the coordinates of three 
pieces.
5. When an empty cell is surrounded by exactly three pieces, a new organism is 
"born" as in Life.100. However, the new organism is of the same type as the 
player with the majority of surrounding pieces. For example:

     1 2 3 4 5
   1  *
   2  *
   3   #
   4
   5

    In this situation, a piece of the type '*' will be born in cell 2,2 because
there are 3 organisms around it and 2 of them are '*'.
 
6. After the players enter their 3 pieces, the board is adjusted to the new 
'generation' and displayed.
7. Each turn both players place one more piece on the board, it is adjusted by 
the computer, and the resulting generation is displayed.
8. Play continues until one player has no live pieces on the board.  The 
computer displays the final board and declares the winner.

    The game is very fun to play, and requires quite a bit of stratagy to win. 
It may seem hard to understand at first, but after a few plays it will become 
clearer.
    I would like to thank all those who take the time and trouble to upload to 
this SIG, without them we all would suffer.  To all those who downloaded my 
first program, Life.100, thanks.  It makes me feel good to know that almost 600
people have downloaded it.
    GREAT THANKS ARE IN ORDER TO JOHN CONWAY (inventor of the original version 
of Life) and Creative Computing for publishing the original program.
