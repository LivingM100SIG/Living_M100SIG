 MYSMZE.100 is a confusing adventure
 game for the 24k MODEL-100. You are
a daring adventurer in a maze (taken 
from ZORK I) full of twisty little 
passages leading to death, dead ends
or victory! You pick up objects and 
solve the mystery of the MYSTERY MAZE.
The mystery of course is to get out 
alive!
 OBJECTS:
---------------------------------------
 To pick up an object such as a cup, 
simply type: GET CUP.
 The cup might be introduced into the
game as an active object by appearing
in a sentence like this:
 There is a gold CUP here.
Notice CUP is capitilized that means in
order to get the CUP all you need to 
type is GET CUP not GET GOLD CUP, you
see if gold were to be capitilized you
would have type: GET GOLD CUP.
 To drop any object simply type: DROP 
CUP.
 MAPPING
---------------------------------------
 It would probably be wise to map the 
maze as you go through it. Even though
there are only about 10 rooms and 3 
objects it is a pretty complicated and
confusing game!
 LOADING GAME
---------------------------------------
 Download the game from CIS in any .DO
file then save the game to a cassette
and load it into BASIC directly. There
is not enough mem. in the 24k 100 to 
load from the .DO file into BASIC.
 COMMANDS
---------------------------------------
To move about the Maze you may use:N
for North, S for South, W for West, E
for East, SE for Southeast, U for up 
and so on.
INV - what you are carrying.
LOOK - Description of Room, If items
       are in the room.
GET - To get an item.
DROP - To drop an item.
 Also, there are a few secret commands
 TIPS
---------------------------------------
 This is my first adventure game, let
alone my first attempt at a game on the
100 so, if you have and suggestions for
 me, please let me know.
 NOTE: Use capitols only.
