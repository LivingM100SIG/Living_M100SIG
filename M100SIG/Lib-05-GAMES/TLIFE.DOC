CONWAY's game of LIFE.
----------------------
LIFE demonstrates that games with very
simple rules can yield complex
situations.

LIFE is played on a boundless grid.  A
computer implimentation uses a wrapping
grid which forms a torus.

LIFE starts with an initial pattern of
cells containing life.  Each generation
is calculated from the previous one in
the following manner:

    - A life cell having zero or one
      neighbors dies of loneliness
    - A life cell having two or three
      neighbors lives on
    - A life cell having four or more
      neighbors dies of overcrowding
    - An empty cell having exactly
      three neighbors spawns new life

These rules are applied simultaneously
to all cells in the grid.

Famous CONWAY life forms:

    block (stable): xx
		    xx

    flasher (generation n): xxx

			     x
	  (generation n+1):  x
			     x

    glider (flies SE):  x
		         x
		       xxx


    spaceship (flies E):   x
			    x
			x   x
			 xxxx

Use a simple BASIC program to set up
the initial life map.  Or use the
blinking dot and the arrow keys.  Press
the space bar to blank out the cell.
Press any other key to put life into
the cell.  Press carriage return to
start.  BREAK will get you out.  PAUSE
will stop the action and let you change
cells again.  Have fun!
