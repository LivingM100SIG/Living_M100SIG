DRAW POKER 1.1 Documentation
BY KARL CHASE [70536,253]
	Play follows standard rules. The deal rotates among the 6 players and 5 cards are dealt to you and your 5 opponents. 
Before each deal each player antes $50 for a total pot of $300. The player next to the dealer may choose to open first. The 
opener Must have a pair of JACKS or better to open. The opener opens the hand by betting a dollar amount. If no one can open, 
the hand is thrown in and another deal commences.The other players need not have this good a hand to "stay". Each player, after
the opener, may fold by typing "F", may call the bet (match the amount previously bet) by typing "C" or may raise by betting a 
dollar amount (the computer a amount necessary to call. For example, if the calling amount is $50 and you enter "20" then the 
total bet will be $70.)  The computer will advise you how much is necessary to call. Raises are limited to $200 and there may 
be only 3 raises.
	After all players have Called or Folded the draw commences. The computer will suggest cards for you to discard, but you
actually choose your own discards. As each active player discards and is given replacement cards, the number of his discards is
printed. These card numbers are valuable clues in your subsequent betting.
	After the draw, the opener bets first, each player may Fold, raise or Call (this would be a check if no money is yet in
the pot and you want to see someone else open). Again there may be 3 raises of up to $200 each. After all players have Folded 
or Called, the computer determins the best hand and will award you the pot if you have won. 
	The 5 opponents will try to play their best according to their hands. That is they will be aggressive with good hands 
and timid with weak hands. 
But they will try to deceive you with their bets in order to encourage you to bet into their strength or to scare you out of an
easy win. Also they will false discard occasionally to mislead you about their strength. For example they will usually draw 3 
cards to a pair but sometimes they will draw 1 or none and then bet like crazy hoping that you will think that they have a very
strong hand and will fold. Watch out for the cagey devils trying to draw to a four-flush and then bluffing when they don't get 
their card. 
	You should also bluff on the right sort of hands and they do not know for sure if you are bluffing because they do not 
know what cards you have but they soon learn if you are a bluffer and adjust accordingly. If you bet strongly and everyone 
folds, then they will suspect. Also if you bet strongly and then lose with a weak hand they will know. Some opponents are 
bolder than others and if you can sort them out , then you can profit. 
	An added feature is that you can draw even if you fold before the draw just to see how your hand might have developed 
if you had not folded.
