CRAPPS.100 is a full-featured Crap game for your Model 100 or 102, including a 
machine-language crap table that your bets are placed on.  It supports almost 
all casino bets, including Pass, Don't Pass, Come, Don't Come, Hard Ways, and 
the other Proposition and Place bets.

If you are not familiar with the rules of craps, don't worry.  These 
instructions, while not intended to be a detailed rule book for the game, will 
get you started, and you will find that you can learn the rest as you go along.
  All of the bets are driven by menus, and are very easy to follow.

Additionally, if you are new to the Model 100, and have not done a lot of 
cassette loading or saving of machine language before, these instructions will 
tell you everything you need to do.

                            GETTING STARTED

First, a warning:  These programs use machine-language code, which might result
in a cold start on your 100.  Therefore, before running any of them, SAVE THEM 
TO CASSETTE OR DISK.  Also save any other files you have in Ram that you want 
to retain.

There are two files required to play CRAPPS.100.  They are:  CRAPPS.100 and 
CRAPPS.QIK.


CRAPPS.100 file

This is the BASIC program you will run every time you play the game.  Please 
note that in the form you download it, it is very long!  You will need almost 
all of your 32K of Ram cleared to transfer it from a .DO file to a .BA file.  
If you do not have enough room, SAVE the .DO file to cassette or disk, then 
kill it from Ram and LOAD it into BASIC directly from the cassette or disk.

To do this with cassette, first delete any extraneous garbage from the 
beginning and end of the file, then save it to cassette as you would any .DO 
file.  Then, go into BASIC and type
KILL CRAPPS.DO
Rewind your cassette, set it up for playing, and type
CLOAD "CRAPPS.DO" [ENTER]
and, at the OK prompt, type
SAVE "CRAPPS.BA

CRAPPS.QIK file

CRAPPS.QIK creates the machine language file CRAPS!.CO, necessary for running 
CRAPPS.100.  It is a major improvement in the graphics of this game, as the 
playing table no longer dissappears, as it did in earlier versions.

To create CRAPS!.CO, you must use RLCLDR.BA from DL7.

First, name the .DO file containing CRAPPS.QIK "CRAPS!.DO".  CRAPS! has to be 
the name of the final .CO file, and this is the easiest place to name it.

Before running RLCLDR, you must clear memory.  If you have no other machine 
language programs in high memory, enter

CLEAR 256, 60991.

Otherwise, use a lower address instead of 60991.

Then, run RLCLDR.  Answer the first prompt with 1 (for LOAD).  When it asks for
a .DO file, enter CRAPS!.  When it asks for start address, enter the memory you
cleared earlier (just the last 5 digit number, not the 256).  The program will 
finish the job itself, and when it tells you it is DONE, you are almost ready 
to play!

If you would like to save CRAPS!.CO as a .CO file on cassette, go into BASIC 
and enter LOADM "CRAPS!" , and write down the three numbers that appear on the 
screen (Top, End, Exe).  Ready your recorder, and enter 
CSAVEM"CRAPS!.CO",xxxxx,xxxxx,xxxxx
where the xxxxx's are the three numbers you copied.

You can check your CSAVEM by rewinding the tape and entering: CLOADM?

The next time you want to load the program from cassette, the command will be:

CLOADM "CRAPS!"

After it is loaded, immediately type:

SAVEM "CRAPS!",xxxxx,xxxxx,xxxxx

using the numbers as above.

 EDIT line 263 of CRAPPS.100, changing 58267 to whatever start address you used
above.  The number appears twice on that line; change it in BOTH places.

If you are using an address lower than 60991 to protect some higher-memory 
program, you may also EDIT line 45; change MAXRAM to

HIMEM+1968



                      HOW TO PLAY

Now that you have gone through the above, you should have CRAPPS.BA and 
CRAPS!.CO in Ram.  You are ready to enjoy the game.

Run CRAPPS.BA.  The first screen gives you two optional ways of running the 
game. You can use one, both, or neither.

THE OPTIONS:

Manual Dice:  The program is designed to run with the built-in computer dice, 
and it is EXTREMELY unlikely that any two games would ever be alike.  However, 
if you want to use your own REAL dice, type M.  When you are prompted to roll 
the dice during the game, roll your own and enter the two numbers.  The 
computer dice will still roll, but the numbers they roll will be the ones you 
entered.

Manual Screen:  The program will show messages about roll results, etc., for a 
few moments each and then move on to the next message automatically.  If you 
would like to play at a different pace, you can control the screen manually 
throughout the game by entering S at this opening prompt.  Each message will 
have [ENTER] at the bottom, and will not move on until you press ENTER.  This 
might be of particular interest to beginners of the game, who want to follow 
the betting a little more slowly.


PLAYING:

All bets are menu-driven, with the letter you must push in reverse video.  
Pressing ENTER will move you up to the previous menu. YOU MUST BE AT THE TOP 
MENU, AND HAVE MADE A PASS OR DON'T PASS BET, TO ROLL.

You will be able to watch the chips laid on the table as you make each bet.  
The minimum bet is $5 and you are playing with $1 chips to facilitate odds 
betting.  You will be prompted as to minimum bets and any other requirements as
you play (for example, you must bet $6 or a multiple of $6 if you want to bet 
on Place 8).

The main bet of Craps is Pass (or Don't Pass).  All other bets are side bets 
and help contribute to the excitement of the game.

On the come-out roll (the first roll of each series), a natural (7 or 11) wins,
craps (2,3, or 12) loses, and any other number becomes a "point."  If you roll 
the point again before rolling a 7, you win.  If not, you lose. The point will 
be highlighted in negative video.  "Don't Pass" is just the opposite, except 
that 12 is a standoff, not a win.
You will see how many rolls you have made, as well as your wins or losses, 
prior to each come-out roll.

There are three types of side bets:  Come (and Don't Come), Place, and 
Proposition

Come bets are like Pass bets, except they are made during other than come-out 
rolls.  Place bets stay on the board, paying off, until a 7 is rolled.  
Proposition bets are good for one roll only, except for Hard 4, 6, 8, and 10, 
which stay until a win or loss.

Odds other than 2-1 are posted where space on the screen allows.  Some other 
odds:  on a Craps/11 win, half the bet is lost and the other is paid at the 
Craps (or 11) odds.  On the Field, 2 or 12 pay 3 to 1.

TO END: Press [ESC] key at any menu prompt.  You will see your final win/lose 
results, and then go to the menu.  It also returns to you the memory used by 
CRAPS!.CO.


PROGRAM CREDITS:

Three utilites were essential in creating this program:

CRAPS!.CO was written in BASIC and changed to machine language with SAVLCD (in 
DL7) by Neil Wick [71056,613].  The program was converted to uploadable format 
with Neil's RLCLDR.

The many circles (in both the BASIC and .CO programs) are generated by 
CIRCLE.BAS by Jay Holovacs [74756,413].

Thanks also to Denny Thomas [76703,444] who was instrumental in improvements in
earlier versions of the program, and to Mike Weiblen [72506,2072], whose TCOMP 
was used in earlier versions of the game.
I hope you win!  Your comments will be appreciated.
