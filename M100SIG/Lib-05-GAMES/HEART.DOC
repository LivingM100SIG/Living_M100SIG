- HEARTBREAKER - 100/200 -
--------------------------

     In this game, your goal is to break as many hearts as possible within the
allotted time.  The amount of time you have is determined by the difficulty
level you choose.  This will be explained in more detail later.
     When the program starts, you are asked to input your Last and First name
in that order, with a comma and a space directly after your last name (i.e.
Doe, John).  If you wish to skip the title screen you can type "PASSWORD" as
your name.
     You will then see the title screen, with our "rapid screen graphics". 
Next, you are asked if you want to activate sound.  Answer the sound option
with Y or N.  Do not hit <ENTER>.  You then can choose what level you wish to
start at (1 to 5, 5 being the hardest).  Once agin do not hit <ENTER>.  You
then have the option to see the three Hi-Score files (SCORES, MAIDS and WDDNG).
     After you have responded to the questions, you will see the instructions.
We have used the first four function keys, at the top of your keyboard, as an
interupt to speed user input.
 The F1 key will randomly place you on the screen.
 The F2 key will fire an arrow at the heart dirrectly below you.
 The F3 key will move you one step to the left.
 The F4 key will move you one step to the right.
     We have added a rap-around feature, so that you can break hearts up to one
end of the screen, keep going, and come out on the other end of the screen.
     If you complete up to level five (by shooting all of the hearts in the
allotted time) and have a score higher than that of the lowest score in the
SCORES file, you will be included in the Hall of Fame.  If you run out of time,
yet have a score that is higher than the lowest score in the MAIDS file, you
will be included in the Old Maids file.  If you get hit by cupids arrows, up to
your resistance level, and have a score which is higher than the lowest score
in the WDDNG file, you will be included in the Wedding file.
     You have to look out for moving hearts.  Hearts can move at any time
durring play.  You may shoot at a heart only to find that it disappeared and
reappeared at another part of the screen.
     The program includes 3 rather long sets of DATA statements for sound.  The
program can be shortened if these were removed.
