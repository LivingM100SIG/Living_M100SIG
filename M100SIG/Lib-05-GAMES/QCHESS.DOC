QuikChess for the Model 100 to be compiled by Tcomp.121 or above.

How to compile:
	1 Load QCHESS & TCOMP.121 from the database.
	2 Save & delete any other files in your machine.  This compilation 
requires almost all 32K.  Be sure to save copies of Tcomp & QChess (Just in 
case).
	3 Run Tcomp using the following: Start=56700, End=<enter>, .BA 
File=QCHESS, .CO File=<enter>.  Now go and find something to do for about 10 
minutes while Tcomp does its thing.
	4 When Tcomp is done, kill QChess & Tcomp (this is why you save it!).  
Then type in SAVEM "QCHESS",56700,MAXRAM,56700.  This creates a .CO of the 
compiled chess.  Now you're all set!

Playing:
	Play is very similar to that of the original Chess program except that 
you do not have to hit <enter> to make your move.  As soon as the 4th character
of your move is entered, the machine starts its play.  The columns are 
identified as A thru H from left to right, although the labels are not on the 
screen.  A common opening move is D2D4.  The backspace key does work if you 
make a mistake & you can exit the game at any input by hitting <esc>.  The 
board editting features of the previous version are not included in QChess 
because of space limitations.  They will be added (along with a few other bells
& whistles) in the future.
