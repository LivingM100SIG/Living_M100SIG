NUMBERS.100 is a numbers game played
on a 7 x 7 grid.  The object of the
game is to accumulate more score than
your opponent ( or the computer).
     The "*" is a suprise value, the
others hold face value.  Player #1 may
only move horizontally (the arrow keys
on the Mod 100 are used), and player
#2, may only move vertically. The game
ends when one player has no more places
he can move. A "(" indicates that a
number has already been chosen.
     It is simple, and great to teach
youngsters how to add. You can work to
trap your opponent to low values and
win.
