   The   program,   TWENT1.100[75665,1045],   was   designed
especially  for  use on the TRS-80 Model 100 computer.   The
rules  of  the  game  were  adapted from the book, "Beat the
Dealer", by Edward O. Thorp, Vintage Books, 1966.


The Pack

  Four packs of cards shuffled together  are  used.   Before
dealing,  if  there  are  less  than 30 cards remaining, the
packs are reshuffled.


The Deal

   The player gets two cards face up.  The  dealer  receives
one card face up and one card face down.


Betting

   The  player  places  his  bet before any cards are dealt.
The bet may range from $ 1.00 to $ 10000.00 in increments of
$ 0.50.


Naturals

   If  the  first two cards dealt either to the player or to
the dealer consist of an  Ace  and  a  10-value  card,  they
constitute  what  we  shall call a "natural" or "blackjack".
If the player has a natural and the  dealer  does  not,  the
player  receives 1.5 times his original bet from the dealer.
If the player does not have a natural and the  dealer  does,
the  player  loses  his  original  bet.   If both player and
dealer have naturals, no money changes hands.


The Draw

   The player looks at his  hole  cards  and  may  elect  to
"pass"  (i.e. "stand");  otherwise he can request additional
cards from the dealer, which are dealt face  up,  one  at  a
time.
   If  the  player  "busts"  (goes  over 21), he immediately
loses his bet to the dealer.  After the player has drawn his
cards,  the  dealer turns up his hole card.  If his total is
16 or less, he must draw a card and continue to  draw  cards



                           -1-


until his total is 17 or more, at which point he must stand.
If the dealer receives an Ace, and  if  counting  it  as  11
would  bring  his  total to 17 or more without exceeding 21,
then he must count the Ace as 11 and stand.


The Settlement

   If the player does not go over 21 and  the  dealer  does,
the  player  wins  an  amount equal to his original bet.  If
neither player nor dealer busts, the person with the  higher
total  wins  an  amount  equal  to  the  original bet of the
player.  If dealer and  player  have  the  same  total,  not
exceeding 21, no money changes hands.


Splitting Pairs

   If  the player's hole cards form a pair, he may choose to
treat them as the  initial  cards  in  two  separate  "twin"
hands.   The original bet goes on one of the split cards and
an equal amount is  bet  on  the  other  card.   The  player
automatically  receives  a  second card on each of the split
cards.  He then plays his twin hands,  one  at  a  time,  as
though   they   were  ordinary  hands,  with  the  following
exceptions:  In the case of split Aces, the player  receives
only  one  card on each Ace.  Further, if a face card or Ten
falls on one of the split Aces, the hand is not counted as a
natural  but only as an ordinary 21.  Similarly, if a player
splits a pair of face cards or Tens and then draws  an  Ace,
it counts only as an ordinary 21.  If a player splits a pair
and receives a third card of  the  same  value,  he  is  not
permitted to split again.


Doubling Down

   If  the  player's  hole  cards total hard 10 or 11 he may
elect to double his bet and draw one,  and  only  one,  more
card.   A  player who splits any pair except Aces may, after
receiving an additional card on each  of  the  split  cards,
double down on any twin hand which totals hard 10 or 11.


Insurance

   If  the  dealer's up card is an Ace, the player may place
an additional side bet  equal  to  half  his  original  bet.
After  the player has decided whether or not to do this, the
dealer checks his hole card.  If the dealer has  a  natural,
the  side bet wins twice its amount.  If the dealer does not
have a natural, the side bet is lost and the play continues.
The  original bet is settled in the usual way, regardless of
the side bet.

The Program

   The program keeps tract of the total amount of money  won
(or lost, if this total is negative).  When the game begins,
and after each shuffle, the player must enter his  bet.   At
the  end of a hand, if you wish to continue without changing
the amount of your bet, hit ENTER.  If you  wish  to  change
the amount of your bet for the next hand, hit the space bar.
When entering your bet, type the letter "q" (or "Q") to  end
the  program.   Type  the letter "r" (or "R") to perform the
POWER OFF, RESUME function.
   An escape mechanism has been built into  the  program  to
enable  the  player  to  change  the value of his bet or the
value of his winnings in the middle or at the end of a hand.
This  was  not intended to be used as a method of "cheating"
but rather as a means  of  easily  correcting  for  keyboard
entry  errors  (such  as  entering  750 instead of 7.50 as a
bet).  To use this mechanism, hit the escape key, ESC.   You
will  then  be  prompted for new values of your purse (total
amount won) and bet.  A null entry will  leave  the  current
value unchanged.
