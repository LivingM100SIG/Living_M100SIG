        =======================

  MICRO-INVADERS IS A SHOOT-EM-UP TYPE ARCADE GAME. THE MICRO-INVADER MOVES
ACROSS AND DOWN THE SCREEN. IF IT REACHES THE BOTTOM, THE GAME IS OVER.
IF A BOMB  HITS YOU, THE GAME IS ALSO OVER.
  YOU, THE PLAYER, MUST DESTROY EACH INVADER BEFORE IT LANDS. AT THE FIRST
LEVEL, IT TAKES ONLY ONE HIT TO DESTROY THE LITTLE VARMINT. AT LEVEL 2 YOU
MUST HIT IT TWICE, AND SO ON. YOU CONTROL THE LASER CANNON AS FOLLOWS:

     KEY  FUNCTION
========  ===========
      ,    MOVE 1 SPACE LEFT
      .    MOVE 1 SPACE RIGHT
      <    MOVE 5 SPACES LEFT
      >    MOVE 5 SPACES RIGHT
      L    MOVE TO CENTER
<SPACE>    FIRE LASER STRAIGHT UP
  <ESC>    FIRE INVADER-SEEKING LASER.

  YOUR STATUS IS DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN AS FOLLOWS:
 LOWER LEFT = CURRENT SCORE
 UPPER LEFT = # OF HITS TO DESTROY 
UPPER RIGHT = TIME REMAINING
LOWER RIGHT = # OF SHOTS <SPACE> LEFT
         OR = # OF SHOTS <ESC> LEFT

  USE THE <ESC> KEY ONLY IN EMERGENCIES. IT AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYS THE INVADER,
BUT YOU START WITH ONLY THREE SHOTS. EACH LEVEL YOU PROGRESS TO EARNS YOU ONE
MORE INVADER-SEEKING SHOT. IT TAKES 10,000 POINTS TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT
LEVEL.

  DON'T HOLD ANY KEY DOWN, BECAUSE THE AUTO-REPEAT FUNCTION OF THE KEYBOARD
WILL CONFUSE THE PROGRAM (NOT TO MENTION YOU!)

  THE PROGRAM STORES THE THREE HIGHEST SCORES IN A FILE NAMED "INVHS.DO".
THESE SCORES ARE DISPLAYED IN THE LOWER RIGHT CORNER OF THE TITLE SCREEN.

  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY BUGS, OR IF YOU HAVE ANY
SUGGESTIONS. IF YOU HAVE ANY SNIDE REMARKS, JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU GET WHAT
YOU PAY FOR!

HAVE FUN!
