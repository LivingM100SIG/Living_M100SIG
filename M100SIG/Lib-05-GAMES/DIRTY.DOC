INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIRTY DOZEN

THE GAME IS A SOLITAIRE PUZZLE WITH
COMBINATIONS & COMPLEXITY EXCEEDING
THE CUBE. IF YOU ENJOY MATH & A REAL
CHALLANGE, PLEASE TRY IT.

UPON RUNNING, THE COMPUTER WILL CRATE
A RANDOM 5X5 GRID WITH 25 NUMBERS
BETWEEN THE VALUES OF 1 AND 99. YOUR
JOB IS TO GET THEM ALL TO 12.

THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CHANGING WHOLE
COLUMNS OR ROWS BY ADDING, SUBTRACTING,
MULTIPLYING OR DIVIDING WITH NUMBERS
BETWEEN 1 & 9.

RESTRICTIONS: YOUR ANSWERS MAY NEVER
EXCEED 99 OR GO BELOW 1. YOU CANNOT
CREATE FRACTIONS.

THE COMPUTER WILL KEEP TRACK OF TURNS.
A SCORE OF 60 OR LESS IS VERY GOOD. BUT
SCORES OF UNDER 50 HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED.

WHEN INPUTING THE <ENTER> KEY IS NOT
NEEDED. ALL ERRORS ARE CAUGHT BY THE
COMPUTER (WITH A COORESPONDING MESSAGE).
THE SUBROUTINE AT LINE 600 IS EGO FLUFF
& CAN BE ELIMINATED. (OR ADDED TO YOUR
OWN PROGRAMS!)

COULD BE MADE FASTER IN ML, BUT IT SEEMS
TO BE FAST ENOUGH IN BASIC.

I ORIGINALLY WROTE THIS PROGRAM FOR THE
ATARI SIG & HAVE TRANSLATED HERE FOR
YOU.

ANY QUESTIONS OF COMMENTS ARE
APPRICIATED.

GOOD LUCK (IT'S TOUGH TO DO)
