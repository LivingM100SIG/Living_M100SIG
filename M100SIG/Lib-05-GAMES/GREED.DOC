The object of GREED is to be the first to score 10,000 points using the six 
computer dice.

POINTS ARE SCORED AS FOLLOWS:

Fives are 50 points
Aces are 100 points
Triple Ace is 1000 points
Triples of numbers 2 to 6 are the number times 100 (3 3 3 = 300)
A straight (1 2 3 4 5 6) is 1500 points

If you roll a triple, any other die of the same number will count as 50 (4 4 4 
4 = 450) whether it's thrown on the same or subsequent rolls. Otherwise the 2 3
4 and 6 have no value.

HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED:

After the first throw you select the dice you want to keep and your points are 
totalled automatically. You then have the option of throwing the remaining dice
for more points or keeping what you have and passing the dice to the computer. 
If you opt to throw and don't score any points then you lose the points 
accumulated on that roll ONLY and play passes to the computer. If you are lucky
enough to use all six dice in one or more rolls then you can throw all six dice
again to score more points. This is where you have to be careful not to get too
GREEDy!

You must score atleast 500 points to begin the game. After that you can stop 
with any number of points you like.

The four arrow keys and <ENTER> are used to tally your dice. The up arrow is 
for triples, the left is for 100's, the right is for 50's and the down is to 
roll the dice again. The <ENTER> key will pass the dice to the computer. You 
must hit the correct arrow key for EACH 100 and/or 50 you want to keep. For 
each triple you only have to hit the key once.

Each player gets an equal number of turns. If you should reach 10,000 first and
were the first to roll then the computer will have a last chance to beat you 
and vice versa. If you're both over 10,000 then the highest score wins. Since 
there is an advantage to going second if you are behind, the starting player 
will be alternated automatically as each new game is played. To help you 
remember who went first in the game an asterisk will be shown next to the 
player that started the game.

The computer will assist you by doing the following:It will...

1. Let you know if you have 50's, 100's or triples and which keys to use. It 
will also tell you if you don't have anything.
2. Remind you of any triple from a previous roll and prompt you if you should 
have a match.
3. Question you if you want to pass and still have points on your roll.
4. Alert you if you press the wrong key and won't let you roll if you have 
points and haven't taken atleast one die.
5. Roll the dice for you and keep track of how many you have left.
6. It will NOT stop you from rolling if you have taken atleast one die and left
other points on the remaining dice. Why? Because many times it's a good 
strategy to keep aces and/or triples and throw a five in hopes of getting an 
ace. By having more dice to throw it will increase your odds of getting another
ace or triple.
SPECIAL NOTE: The dice are "thrown" in a random order. They are arranged in 
ascending order before displaying to aid in viewing and totalling scores.

SUMMING IT UP:

The computer already knows it's strategy. You will develop yours as you play 
more often. It is a game of luck as well as skill in knowing when to stop and 
when to risk it all. In any given game you have just as good a chance as the 
computer to win.

The computer is programmed to play the way I would play. It's strategy covers 
as many situations as I could think of. Since there's virtually an unlimited 
number of ways various combinations of throws could affect the game, you may 
run across a case where the computer is not too bright. (Especially in the end 
game). I welcome any comments or suggestions that would make the computer play 
as humanly as possible. Good Luck and most of all, HAVE FUN!!
