.
.PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
.-------------------
.This program plays exactly like George Dunsay's fine original BOX.BA in this 
data library.  Refer to BOXING.DOC in this DL for play instructions.
.
.NEWBOX.BA Differences with BOX.BA
.---------------------------------
.1. SCORING: The BOXING.DOC file posted a table that described the scoring 
system the program is to use for various blows and defensive manuevers.  The 
original BOX.BA program failed to account for the following conditions:
.a. When ducking a jab, the table indicated that zero (0) SHOULD be the points 
deducted to account for avoiding the blow, however, the original program 
deducted 1 point (-1) anyway as if the the duck never took place.
.b. According to the same table, the fighter who ducked into an upcoming body 
blow should get 5 pts. deducted.  The unmodified program only deducted 3 points
(-3) as if the blow was a normal body blow.  A body shot to a guy who has his 
head ducked down there should receive more injury than if he didn't duck.
.
.2. The CAPS LOCK requirement has been removed.  Although the original program 
does remind the player(s) to use CAPS LOCK during run time, it was unnecessary 
and inconvenient; the extra coding for the message and screen time delay used 
additional memory.
.
.3. The logic in the scoring was not totally correct.  The program upon 
finishing the last round of the bout, skipped the last round score evaluation 
routine.  All one round fights were always drawn; all multiround fights showed 
correct intermediate scores after each round but the final score were  always 
overlooked and because of this, the final score (and decision) were based on 
tallies up to round before the last round.
.
.4. The text material has received a face lift by getting upper/lower case 
text.  The original program used only uppercase throughout.
.
.5. The one player mode as been modified to prevent the computer generated 
opponent from cheating!  George Dunsay has apparently incorporated an 
unannounced routine that took an extra point off the human player for each blow
the computer made.  The human had a very hard time of winning.  Line 386 of 
this modified program has been commented out to undo the cheat routine.  Any 
user who wishes to play with the handicap can reactivate line 386.
.
.There may be other minor program adjustments like slight code compresion 
implemented in NEWBOX.BA that may have been overlooked.  In any case, this is a
fine amusing game that offers competitive real time slug out between two human 
opponent.
