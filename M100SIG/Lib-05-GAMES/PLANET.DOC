Documentation for Planet Protector!
===================================

	You are hovering above your home base on the planet TRS-80.  Aliens
have landed on your planet!  Eight of their bases have been established.
You must seek them out and destroy them, but each one is protected by a tiny
heat-seeking missile.  After you destroy all eight, they are re-built, and
faster missiles protect them.  However, they only have enough supplies to re-
build four times.  If you destroy all five sets of bases, you are proclaimed
the hero of TRS-80!

====================
	Download PLANET.SRC, and save it as PLANET.DO.  Download PLANET.LDR,
and save it as LOADER.BA.  Run LOADER, and it will create the file PLANET.CO.
(It takes about three minutes.)  Delete PLANET.DO and LOADER.BA, and run
PLANET.CO.
	PLANET.CO is 2674 bytes long.  It is located at 56000 to 58673.

After you load the game, it should be safe to re-load your Basic and Text
files.  (I hate cold starts!)

====================
	When you run the game, the title page will appear.  Press any key to
continue.  Your ship appears in the upper-center of the screen, above the
words "Press the SPACEBAR to begin".  Your difficulty level is in the lower-
right hand corner of the screen.  The vertical line next to it is your fuel
gauge.  The refueling base is on the surface of the planet right below your
ship.  There are no alien bases in sight.
	To move your ship, use the I, J, K and M keys.  Pressing one of these
four keys activates a thrust rocket to propel you in the approriate direction.
Use reverse thrust to brake.  You can go as high as you like, but there are no
aliens up there.  The planet is round, so you can go left or right until you
return to your starting point.
	The force of gravity on your planet is weak, but those wily aliens
have found a way to increase it as you destroy more of their bases (nasty
little suckers!)
	To dock with the refueling base, you must slowly descend between the
guide-rails until a beep sounds.  You are then refueled.  Don't linger, or
the fuel will explode!
	You have a laser on your ship, but it only fires downward.  You must
be immediately above your target to destroy it.  You do not get any points
for getting the little homing missiles, but once you destroy one, it will not 
return until the next level.
	Hints:  Practice docking with the base at the beginning when you are
already over the base.  Also, you may want to kill the little homing varmint
near the base right away, so it won't bother you if you have to refuel.
	If you succesfully destroy all the alien bases, the game ends and
something rather peculiar happens.  The first person to tell me what happens
will get the first scenario of a "Wizardry"-type game for the Model 100
mailed to them free.  I will change the program description to announce the
winner.

====================
	This program was assembled using Custom Software's excellent assembler
program.  The speed of this program and the ease of it's use allowed me to
write this game from scratch in less than a week.
	Please let me know what you think of this game.  I am always
interested in changing and (hopefully) improving my programs.  If you have
any ideas for a game or utility let me know.  All my Model 100 programs are
available through the SIG.
