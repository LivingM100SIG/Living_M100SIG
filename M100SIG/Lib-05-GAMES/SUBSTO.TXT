             The Nuclear Submarine Adventure

      Due to the growing threat of Communist expansion and nuclear 
proliferation, the U.S.S. Nautilus has been reactivated from the mothball 
fleet. The Nautilus has been totally refitted with modern equipment, including 
16 missile tubes carrying the new Trident-1 nuclear missile, a water-cooled 
reactor, 2 torpedo tubes armed with MK-48 torpedoes, and totally new submarine 
quieting, mobility, and self defense systems.  For the crew there is a new and 
separate health room, and an easy access passageway in the fore and aft 
sections of the ship.

      You are a new crewman aboard the Nautilus, and although you have received
extensive training before you started your tour of duty, experience is the best
teacher, and you will learn much during your stay onboard.

      You are currently aboard with a skeleton crew, testing to see if and how 
the ship can be operated safely if most of the crew somehow became 
incapacitated.

      Good luck, and remember, you, as a member of the United States Submarine 
Corps, are helping to ensure that the United States continues to maintain a 
credible, survivable deterrent to nuclear war into the 21st century.
