GENERAL OUTLINE
---------------
This game is a simulation of a Boxing
Match. It allows you to fight a human
opponent or one generated by the
computer.

Unlike most sports games, this one
allows you to plot your strategy for
the round and then sit back and
graphically watch the action unfold.

While at first appearances the game
will seem to be controled by chance,
more play will show you that your
strategy will determine if you win or
lose!

PLAY PROCEDURE
--------------
When you first run the game the
computer will ask you a series of
questions to determine how you will
play. Answer each to determine the
basic ground rules.
#1) If you play the computer answer
    1 person.
#2) Input the amount of rounds (1-15)
#3) Round scoring indicates 1 point for
    winning a round and 0 for losing.
    10 point must is a boxing term for
    awarding 10 poits to the winner of
    a round and less to the loser 
    depending on how well he fared.
#4) Input the name of your boxer. If
    playing against the computer it
    will pick a name for your opponent
    otherwise the 2nd player selects a
    name for his boxer

The M-100 will then ask you to input 50
moves. Using the chart displayed on the
left of the screen, use the letter that
indicated which move you want to make.
No return key is needed. If you are 
making a series of the same move, just
hold the appropiate key down. A tone
indicated move input while another 
sound tell you that you have picked an
illegial code and must choose again.

After you have picked your 50 moves the
2nd player selects his. If playing the
computer you will be told what mode the
computer will fight that round (normal,
defensive or aggressive). The M-100
then selects it's moves. by the way it
plays fair and does not refer to what
you have inputted before making it's
selections.

If you are playing the 2 player mode 
your 2nd player would input his/her
moves here. It is suggested that you
do not watch each other input so as
to give no advantage to the person
selecting 2nd.

FIGHTING THE ROUND
------------------
At this point the computer will display
both fighters and graphically show you
the round. Sit back and enjoy the
action!

It would seem that all you have to do
is initially input punches until you
have hit your opponent enough times to
knock him down. It's not that easy!

The computer keeps track of a number of
statistics that limit what you can do.

CONDITION-At the beginning of the fight
you start with 100 Condition Points.
Each time you throw a punch you lose
some of these points. Each time you
move or avoid a punch you regain
conditioning. If you allow your
Condition Poits to go to 0 you will
be too tired to punch. A chart at the
end of this section shows how points
are added and subtracted.

INJURY POINTS - This is the key to
winning the fight. Again you start with
100 points. Each time you are hit you
lose some. The amount is determined by
the type of punch and what your current
position is. (e.g. if you are in a
blocking or ducking mode you can
reduce the impact of the punch)

The boxers must also be in next to
each other to punch. If you are too far
away and you have programed in a punch
the computer will change that move to
a forward move and move you closer to
you opponent.

You are allowed to back away to avoid
being hit but are limited to the size
of the ring. You cannot move into
your opponent so the computer will
not allow forward moves when you are
next to him.

As you watch the round you will see
your injury & conditioning changing
depending on the action. A clock is
located in the lower right to let you
know how much time is remaining.
Beneath the boxers id displayed there
last move.

KNOCKDOWN
---------
If your Injury Points go down to 0, you
are knockeddown. The ref starts to
count & your opponent is sent to a
neutral corner.

Sometimes you get up and sometimes you
don't. It depends on how many times 
you've been knocked down previously &
how late it is in the fight.

If you get up, you are give some injury
points & your opponent regains some 
conditioning.

END OF ROUND
------------
When the round is over, the computer
tells you who won that round and the
current score of the fight. You also
regain some conditioning and injury
points. (but not a lot). Look
carefully at your opponents current
condition & injury. This will help you
determine how to fight the next round.

WHAT EACH MOVE IS & IT'S EFFECT
-------------------------------
F - FORWARD
Moves your boxer forwrd 1 space.
Condition +1
All punches are converted to this if
you are too far away to hit.
Forward move is limited to opponents
position

R - REVERSE
Moves your boxer back 1 space.
Condition +1
Limited by size of ring.

D - DUCK
A defensive move. Prevents you from
being hit by certain punches(see chart)

K - BLOCK
Another defensive move. Also prevents
you from being hit. But acts
differently than duck
Do not use "B" as this command means
something else.

J - JAB
Soft punch. Only causes small Injury.
Does not use much Conditioning.

B - Body
Medium punch. Uses moderate
Conditioning, but can cause a lot of
Injury.

H - HEAD
Hardest punch. Uses most conditioning.
Usually causes most Injury.

INJURY CONDITIONING CHART
-------------------------
MOVE OR   CONDTNG  INJURY CREATED
PUNCH     +/-      FRJBH   K   D
---------------------------------
FORWARD    +1        -     -   -
REVERSE    +1        -     -   -
BLOCK      +1        -     -   -
DUCK       +1        -     -   -
JAB        -1       -1    -1   0
BODY       -3       -3     0  -5
HEAD       -5       -5    -3   0

This chart shows the relationship
between moves/punches and conditioning
and injury.
e.g.- If you throw a HEAD punch and
your opponent has DUCKed. You use 5
conditioning point and he lose 0 injury
If he had been punching he would get
lose 5 injury points.

The game appears more complicated than
it really is. Try it, you'll find
playing and experimenting the best way 
to learn.
