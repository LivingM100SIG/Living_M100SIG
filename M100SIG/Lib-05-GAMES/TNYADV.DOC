    STORY

        An adventure game is like a novel: it has a plot and an ending. Your
    goal is to reach the ending and along the way to discover the plot. Unlike
    a book, in an adventure game you create the plot as you go. And the end
    you reach depends on the moves you make along the way. The author has
    created the scenario, but you supply the action.
        In this game, there may be a million dollars hidden somewhere inside
    an old house. Your goal is to find the money and get it back to the
    starting point. How you accomplish that (if you do) is up to you! The clues
    and tools you need are accessible. However, be careful! They may get you
    into trouble!


    COMMANDS

        You create the action by issuing commands to your character. In this
    game, that consists of a one or two-word entry at the ">" prompt. The
    format is VERB OBJECT (uppercase required); which performs the named action
    upon the named object. Two-word entries must be separated by one space.
    Use the full word(s), spelled correctly. For example, TAKE FLASHLIGHT
    makes the character pick up and carry the flashlight if it's visible
    at his location. Some actions require only the single word entry of the
    appropriate verb. LOOK causes the items visible at the present location to
    be listed. Your character moves from one location to the next with a single
    letter entry of N, S, E, W, U, or D (for North, South, East, West, Up, and
    Down). There is another verb that also causes a movement at the appropriate
    location. Some of your most powerful verbs are used to provide clues about
    objects and their environment. EXAMINE DOOR will tell something useful
    about the door. LIST will list the items carried by your character (he can
    carry up to five at the same time), WHERE prints the current location, and
    QUIT ends the game. This game recognizes 21 verbs and 48 objects. Half
    the fun is figuring out which words work, but if you get frustrated, the
    verbs are listed in lines 3320-3322 and the objects in lines 3298-3304.


    MESSAGES

        The messages you receive are important clues. Do not ignore them! On
    the other hand, don't let them lead you astray, either! Other messages may
    be printed if you use a word the game doesn't recognize, if you need some-
    thing you don't have, if the object is not visible, or if the action cannot
    be performed. For example, if you tell your character to take something,
    but the message says he can't, maybe that item is still hidden, or maybe
    his arms are full and he just needs to drop something first!
