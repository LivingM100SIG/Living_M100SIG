   MICRO-STARFIGHTER IS A SHOOT-EM-UP
TYPE ARCADE GAME.  BECAUSE IT IS
WRITTEN IN BASIC, IT IS NOT A FAST-
MOVING GAME.  HOWEVER, IT IS EXCITING,
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK AHEAD 4 OR
5 MOVES IN ORDER TO PLAN AN EFFICIENT
ATTACK.
                                 --->>>
   THE MICRO-ENEMIES MOVE FROM RIGHT TO
LEFT ACROSS THE SCREEN. THE OBJECT OF
THE GAME IS TO DESTROY AS MANY OF THEM
AS YOU CAN WITHIN 200 SECONDS.
   YOU, THE PLAYER, TRY TO DESTROY EACH
ENEMY BEFORE IT GOES OFF THE SCREEN.
YOU LOSE 20 POINTS FOR EACH ONE YOU LET
BY.                              --->>>
 THE SCORE FOR DESTROYING EACH ONE
DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE ON THE SCREEN,
AND THE TYPE OF ENEMY YOU HIT. THE
FURTHER RIGHT THAT YOU ARE, THE MORE
POINTS YOU GET. ALSO, THE FASTER
ENEMIES ARE WORTH MORE, AND ADD TIME TO
YOUR TIME REMAINING.
                                 --->>>
   THE FASTER ENEMIES ALSO HAVE LASERS,
BUT THEY SHOOT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.
DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON THEM!  IF YOU
GET SHOT, OR YOU COLLIDE WITH ONE,
YOU BECOME DISABLED FOR 10 SECONDS.

YOU CONTROL YOUR SPACE SHIP AS FOLLOWS:
                                 --->>>

========  ===========
   A  Z   MOVE 1 SPACE UP OR DOWN

   YOUR STATUS IS DISPLAYED ON THE
SCREEN AS FOLLOWS:
        LEFT = CURRENT SCORE
 MIDDLE LEFT = HIGH SCORE
MIDDLE RIGHT = LEVEL OF PLAY (-1 TO 5)
       RIGHT = TIME REMAINING

                                 --->>>
   THE GAME STARTS AT LEVEL 0, WITH 3
ENEMIES ON THE SCREEN.  EACH 100 POINTS
INCREASES THE LEVEL UNTIL LEVEL 4, WITH
7 ENEMIES ON THE PROWL.  LEVEL 5 OCCURS
AT 1000 POINTS.  ABOVE 2000 POINTS,
HITTING A FAST ENEMY DOES NOT INCREASE
THE TIME REMAINING.  (MY HIGH SCORE IS
2,466).                          --->>>
STRATEGIES:
1> STAYING TO THE LEFT IS SAFER, BUT
   YOU GET MORE POINTS IF YOU STAY MORE
   TOWARDS THE RIGHT.
2> AT HIGHER LEVELS, CONCENTRATE MORE
   ON THE FAST ENEMIES, AS THEY ADD
   TIME TO YOUR TIME REMAINING.
                                 --->>>
3> TO MAKE USE OF EVERY MOVE, YOU CAN
   PRESS KEYS IN ADVANCE.  BE CAREFUL
   THOUGH, YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK A MOVE.
   DON'T HOLD ANY KEY DOWN, BECAUSE THE
   AUTO-REPEAT FUNCTION OF THE KEYBOARD
   WILL CONFUSE THE GAME (NOT TO
   MENTION YOU!)
                                 --->>>
  THE PROGRAM STORES THE THREE HIGHEST
SCORES IN A FILE NAMED "STARHS.DO". THE
PROGRAM CREATES THE FILE AUTOMATICALLY
IF IT DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST. THESE
SCORES ARE DISPLAYED IN THE LOWER RIGHT
CORNER OF THE TITLE SCREEN.

IT FOR DEBUGGING ANY CHANGES YOU MIGHT
MAKE TO THE PROGRAM.
