Instructions:
	Most responses to prompts are
on INKEY$ so that reaction is quick.
The exceptions are when asked "Where
to ?" or "Room # ?" which must be ans-
wered with nn and <ENTER>.
	First question, "Cave #" sets
the difficulty level. See descriptions
below. From that point your object is
to find & shoot the Wumpus before you
run out of arrows &/or some disaster
befalls you. It is suggested that you
not shoot until you smell or bump the
Wumpus; but then ......

Cave Descriptions:
	#0 Dodecahedron. Rooms are on a
	   12-sided object, each 
           forming a pentagon. Rooms
           are at the corners & each
           has tunnels leading to three
           other rooms.
--
	#1 Mobius Strip. Two rooms wide
	   and 10 rooms around (like a
	   belt with a half twist).
--
	#2 String of Beads. Five beads
	   in a circle. Each bead is a
	   diamond with a cross-bar.
	   The right & left corners
	   lead to neighboring rooms.
--
	#3 Hex Network. Imagine a hex
	   tile floor. Take a rectangle
	   with 20 points inside (4x4).
	   Join right & left sides to
	   make a cylinder. Join top &
	   bottom to form a Torus.
-----------
	Above Caves are regular in that
each room goes to three other rooms &
tunnels allow two-way traffic. Next are
some irregular caves.
-----------
	#4 Dendrite with Degeneracies.
	   Pull a plant from the ground
	   & roots/branches form a den-
	   drite; ie. no looping paths.
	   Degeneracy means a) some
	   rooms connect to themselves,
	   b) some rooms have more than
           one tunnel to the same other
	   room.
--
	#5 One-way Lattice. Here all
	   tunnels go one way only. To
	   return, you must go around
	   the Cave - about 5 moves.
--
	#6 Design your own Cave. The
	   computer will ask you the
	   rooms next to each other in
	   the Cave.     Example:
	     Room #1     ? 2,3,4
	     Your reply of 2,3,4 means
	   Room 1 has tunnels going to
	   Rooms 2, 3, & 4.

	Editing: Animation may be
speeded up by reducing time delay in
the T FOR....NEXT loops; especially in
lines 791-792 where the Wumpus ambles
along flicking his tongue(?). Deletion
of lines 25-49, 285-290, 315-325,
790-821 and 845-855 will remove the
animation but have no effect on the
play of the game.
