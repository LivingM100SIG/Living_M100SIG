                       RED DOG !!!  RED DOG !!!!  RED DOG !!!!

          This is  the old game of Red Dog that  was played by Doc Holiday,
          Wyatt Earp, etc.  It is now being featured at Los Vegas as the
          hottest thing out.

          It is also know as Acey-Ducey, In Between, Double Middles and
          many others depending on if you lost or won.

               You play as follows:

          Enter the names of up to four players when asked, and also how
          much money they want in their poke.

          At each play, there is an automatic ante of $1.00

          The dealer draws two card and places them on either side of the
          table in their appropriate spaces.  You wager that the third card
          drawn will be between the other two and not the same as either of
          them. Ignore suits, only the number counts.

          Aces are always high.

          The number of cards between the two turned over determines the
          odds.

                                 Spread    Odds
                                    1      9-1 
                                    2      4-1 
                                    3      3-1 
                                    4      2-1 
                                   5-11    Even (1-1)

          After seeing the two cards and checking the odds, you can raise
          $0-9.

          Press Enter if you don't want to raise. Otherwise, enter the
          number.

          A pair of the same size is a push bet.  Your bet is cancelled. 
          However, if the pairs is Jacks or higher, then a third card is
          drawn.  If this is the same (now three of a kind) it pays 11-1 on
          your $1.00 ante.

          All consecutives (5-6, etc) are a push.  Bets are returned.

          If neither of the above occur, a third card is turned over.  If
          the card is between the other two, you win and your bet,
          multiplied by the odds is added to your poke.  If you lose, you
          lose you ante and raise (if any).

          At the end of each game, all players pokes are displayed.  If you
          want to continue, press ENTER or any other key.  If you want to
          quit, press (Q).

          If you think these odds are bad,you should have seen some of the
          others offered at Los Vegas.
