  The programs 'JBADV1.BA1' AND JBADV1.BA2' are two halves of a 21k 
portable text adventure. You should download JBADV1.BA1 as a .DO file, 
convert it to BASIC and resave it, then download the other and merge the two. 
Also download DATA1.DO, the data file for the adventure.
  JBADV1 is an advanced BASIC text adventure which accepts FULL ENGLISH 
SENTENCES. Thus, the user can enter commands such as OPEN THE DOOR THEN WALK
TO THE SOUTH or TAKE THE PAPER AND EXAMINE IT or GET THE FOOD AND THE WATER
OR DROP EVERYTHING. Upper and lowercase do not make a difference, and IT can be
used to refer to the last object mentioned. Commands such as STEAL 
LIGHTER are also accepted. 
Unfortunately, the translation routine is not extremely fast, so short commands
such as GET LIGHTER take less time to translate. In future adventures, I hope 
to fix this. Also, words are only recognized for their first three 
letters, thus TAK PAP is the same as TAKE PAPER.
  I hope to contribute adventures of this type regularly to this data base, 
so look for the keyword JBADVENTURE. I hope to be able to upload maybe one or 
two a month, and they will of course become progressively harder, smaller, 
and hopefully more advanced.
  This particular adventure, the first JBADVENTURE, places you inside an old 
house, and you must figure out how to get out. You start on the front porch. 
Getting in is easy: just open the door. The front door can always be used, but 
the point of the adventure is to find your way through the entire house.
  When you solve the adventure, please leave me a message through EasyPlex 
which includes the verification code (given at the end of the adventure), 
comments, and your name. I am trying to see relatively how hard this adventure 
is so I can design the next ones accordingly.
  If you like this adventure, keep watching for more JBADVENTURES! I hope 
to have more coming!
