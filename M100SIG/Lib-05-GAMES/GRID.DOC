INTRODUCTION: 
This is a high-resolution game of 
barriers and entrapment.  If you have 
seen the movie TRON or played TRAP.100, 
then you know the game already. 
A pixel belongs to each player and the 
cursor arrows direct its course.  The 
pixel moves at constant speed and the 
object is to cause the opponent to 
crash into either a trail or a wall. 
In two-player mode, the cursor arrows 
are duplicated for player A with keys 
F1-F4.  In one-player mode, player A is 
automatic, played by the "GridBug". 
At random intervals, the screen is not 
cleared when a round begins to add a 
little more complication to the game. 
--------------------------------------- 
SCORING: 
Scoring is handled by counting down 
from 100 points for each round, 
deleting one point for each three grid- 
marks covered, and yes, the score for a 
round can go negative.  In that case, 
the better course is to back up on 
yourself and give the negative score to 
your opponent. 
A full game might be to play until one 
player scores over 1000.  There is no 
code to handle this, so it is up to the 
player(s) to decide what makes a game. 
-------------------------------------- 
PLAYING THE GridBug: 
A human and the bug are two different 
animals, so the strategy differs.  The 
bug has better reaction time and can 
shave a wall every time, but he is 
blind to the whole grid and can only 
sense his immediate neighborhood. 
If there is anyone out there who beats 
the gridbug consistently, let me know 
your strategy. 
-------------------------------------- 
BEGINNING PLAY: 
The screen will be blanked (most of the 
time) except for two pixels.  One will 
be blinking, that is player B.  Press 
any key to begin.  If it is a cursor 
key, that command will be ignored.  The 
direction of travel starts up randomly, 
so if your pixel begins against a wall, 
there is a real chance that you will 
immediately run into the wall.  If you 
hit a direction without looking where 
you are going, you can also back up 
onto your own trail and shoot yourself 
in the foot.  Watch out. 
-------------------------------------- 
TECHNICAL NOTE: 
I wrote this game in response to my 
horror at the lack of a PPOINT function 
in BASIC.  Using SCDUMP as a starting 
point, I developed the subroutine in 
line 36.  It works, but I would like 
something a little faster and something 
that doesn't blink the cursor. 
The subroutine tests the pixel at x,y 
and sets z=0 if that bit is dark. 
The game as a whole has been 
extensively tested (played) in the one- 
player mode.  After all, this is 
definitely a one-person computer, but I 
have confidence that the two-person 
game is reasonably functional.
