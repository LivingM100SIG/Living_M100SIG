         This set of basic program lines add the feature of having the computer
 "Scan"  your Bingo cards for a possible winning pattern and alert you to which
 one has which pattern. Since the scan is time  consuming  and  not  all  Bingo
 games  are  "straight"  Bingo; ie... 4 corners, big or small picture frame, X,
 etc.; allows you to select which patterns you wish the program to search  for.
 Additionally,  I  have  included  the  provision  to enable / disable the scan
 during play, again, to save time.
         As with most gains in life, there are usually losses: To  keep  it  as
 simple  as 8 F-keys allow, I dropped the "Mask" portion of the program, seeing
 it as a redundant feature if the  "Scan"  is  being  used.  Also,  the  memory
 requirements are a little larger now.
         Now, to add it to your current COVER.106 program:
                                  !!!WARNING!!!
 If  you  have  modified  your  COVER.106  program the COVMOD probably WILL NOT
 WORK!!! Suggest you Download COVER.106 again and start fresh if you  want  the
 scan routine.
         1. Download "COVMOD.106"
         2. Store as "COVMOD.DO"
         3. from Basic: LOAD"COVER.BA" (your "COVER.106")
         4. from Basic: MERGE"COVMOD.DO"
         5. wait......
         6.  when  the  OK  prompt  returns,  save the resulting program out of
 memory to a storage device (just in case!). This is your "New, Improved  COVER
 with Scan program".

         Operating the program:
 COVER should work the same as before in all respects except:
         1. in the play menu, the "Mask" under F-7 has been replaced by "Scan".
 Selecting F-7 will show a prompt for
 "Toggle  pattern  on/off with ##, ESC to Exit" and a line of numbers from 0-14
 above the prompt. This section accepts input the same as the  new  card  entry
 portion  does... press two keys to input a number: 01,07,11, etc. By inputting
 numbers, the program either marks that  pattern as something to look  for  and
 turns  that  number  on in reverse video or ignores that pattern and turns the
 number back to normal video. the pattern/number table  follows:  (The  "O"  is
 ignored)

 Pattern 00    01    02    03    04
         XXXXX OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO 
         OOOOO XXXXX OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO 
         OOOOO OOOOO XXXXX OOOOO OOOOO 
         OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO XXXXX OOOOO 
         OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO XXXXX 

 Pattern 05    06    07    08    09
         XOOOO OXOOO OOXOO OOOXO OOOOX 
         XOOOO OXOOO OOXOO OOOXO OOOOX 
         XOOOO OXOOO OOXOO OOOXO OOOOX 
         XOOOO OXOOO OOXOO OOOXO OOOOX 
         XOOOO OXOOO OOXOO OOOXO OOOOX 

 Pattern 10    11    12    13    14
         XOOOO OOOOX OOOOO XXXXX XOOOX 
         OXOOO OOOXO OXXXO XXXXX OOOOO 
         OOXOO OOXOO OXOXO XXOXX OOOOO 
         OOOXO OXOOO OXXXO XXXXX OOOOO 
         OOOOX XOOOO OOOOO XXXXX XOOOX 
                     small black four
                     frame -out  corners

         Suggest  you  print  and  save  a copy of the above patterns for quick
 referance - to save memory, I removed the Pattern  display  routine  from  the
 program.
         2.  While  in  "Call"  (F-4),  the additional prompt "S-Toggle "[Scan]
 appears under the time  display.  This  turns  the  Scan  routine  ON  ("Scan"
 appears  in  reverse  video)  or  OFF  ("Scan"  disappears). When ON, the scan
 routine will wait until after you have entered a  call  and  then  search  all
 cards  for  a  match with one of the selected patterns. With the pattern chart
 above, the "O" is ignored, Scan only compares against "X" - matching all "X"'s
 in a selected pattern (from F-7) will sound a  BEEP  and  display  that  cards
 contents  and  serial  number  in the card window. If more than one card has a
 match-up with a pattern or more than one pattern is present  on  a  card,  the
 Beep  will sound at every match and the window will show only the latest match
 (Right, Bottom card scanned last).

         Hints and tips:
         Playing 30 cards and all 14 patterns and scanning after each call  can
 cause  a "backlog" on the computer. (and lots of confusion). Suggest selecting
 only the patterns required to construct the  winning  pattern  for  the  game.
 Large  X  =  10 & 11, large frame = 0, 4, 5 & 9, etc. and, if playing a lot of
 cards or the caller goes fast, turn the  Scan  "OFF"  with  "S"  at  the  call
 routine.  Turn  it  back  on only after a reasonable number of calls have been
 completed. (Blackout can't happen in < 24 calls).

 Any problems, bugs or suggestions??? Let me know! Don't  know  when  I'll  get
 back to you since I've been using this for 4 months without posting it, but...
