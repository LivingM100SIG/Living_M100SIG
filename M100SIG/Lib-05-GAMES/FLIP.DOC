Instructions for FLIP.100


     FLIP.100 is a version of an old dice-and-flipper game.  It is 
traditionally played in a box with flippers marked "1" to "9" and an area to 
roll dice.  The players begin with the flippers up, and lower them as play 
progresses.  For the Model 100 version, the numbers in POSITIVE video represent
the flippers up, and in NEGATIVE video represent the flippers down.

     You are playing against the computer.  You always roll first.  Press any 
key to roll the dice.  You then press ONE or TWO buttons, which are number keys
that add up to the TOTAL of the two dice.  For example, if you rolled 3 and 4, 
you could flip [7] or [1 and 6] or [2 and 5] or [3 and 4], as long as none of 
the buttons you push has already been flipped.  If flipping two numbers, you 
can press them in either order; they will not be flipped until you press the 
second one.

     Continue rolling the dice until you roll a number you cannot match.  The 
total of the remaining un-flipped numbers is your score.  The LOWER the score, 
the better.

     Then the computer will have it's turn.  You don't have to push any buttons
while it plays.  Just watch!

     At the end of a round,if the player OR the computer has a score equal to 
or greater than 45, that is a LOSS, unless both are equal to or greater than 
45, in which case the low score WINS.  Ties over 45 are scored as TIES.  You 
can watch the cumulative scores progress on the bars at the bottom of the 
display.  Press [SHIFT] [BREAK] to end the game.

     The game is much easier than it may sound at first reading.  Load it, and 
have fun!
