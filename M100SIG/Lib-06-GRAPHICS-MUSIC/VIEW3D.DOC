VIEW3D will display a stereoptic pair of a three dimensional object as seen 
from any desired direction. It'll run in 8K. Checksum=134,195.
To create the stereoptic effect, two views of an object are displayed, one for 
each eye.  Each is calculated with a small horizontal offset, first to the 
left, then to the right. When each eye sees its view, your brain uses the 
slight differences between the views as cues to relative distance.
Included in this program are data for displaying a truncated cube.
To view the object, you must enter two sets of X,Y,Z data: the place you want 
to look from (called 'EYE') and the point you want to look at (called 'COV' for
Center Of View). These two entries are used to determine a viewing window onto 
which the object points are projected.
One other entry is required for display; that is MAG. This is just a simple 
multiplier to adjust the size of the images. Entering 1 causes no adjustment.
For your first view, try:
EYE: 100,40,40
COV: 0,0,0
MAG: 2
After that, EXPERIMENT! Move around and see what it looks like from different 
positions.
VIEW3D is setup to be viewed using a stereopticon or by letting your eyes drift
walleyed. Additional details on viewing stereoptic images can be found in 
STEREO.DOC in XA3. (A note to the frustrated: About 8% of people cannot see 
stereo images. Sorry 'bout that.)
After the stereo pair is displayed, a blinking cursor will appear in the upper 
left corner of the screen. Pressing ENTER will display your previous view data 
and allow you to enter new data for another view.
When specifying EYE points, try not to get too close to the object. The 
differences between the views at a close distance are very great and it is 
nearly impossible for your brain to fuse them into one image. If you get REALLY
close (inside the object), you will get a message to that effect. (Projecting 
points that are behind EYE will be done in a future version.)
I hope you'll try creating your own objects. An object is described by two data
tables: at line 800 is a list of points in 3-space (X,Y,Z coordinates) and at 
line 900 is a list of pairs that specify which points are to be connected by a 
line (From-To). The program is currently setup to handle 25 points.
If you have any ideas, comments or neat objects, I'd like to hear from you!
