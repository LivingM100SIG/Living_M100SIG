Just a couple of notes regarding HURON.100 and HURON.DAT:

   HURON.DAT file must be in RAM saved as HURON.DO.  File should begin with
??77  Delete everything before this.  (File ends with a quotation mark (").)

   All keys are disabled while the program is running.  The only ways to stop
it are to
 1) wait till it's done or
 2) push the reset button on the back of your computer.

   If you do stop it, (say by adding a STOP statement, DO NOT type CONT or
attempt to call the routine after the screen has scrolled.  Machine language
subroutine is stored in the first 2 lines of the LCD character memory.

   Best to run the program by entering from the main menu.  If you've changed
the program without going back to the menu afterwards, you will sometimes see
random "snow" instead of the proper graphics.  This should not disturb anything
in memory, but is nevertheless undesirable.
