               COALA.100 (revised instructions 5/1/86)
               by Don Zeikel [75775,1430
     COALA.100 is a graphics program that turns your model 100 keyboard into a 
graphics palette with 8 cursor keys and 18 different brushes!

     Although written in BASIC, it is far too slow when run as a BASIC program.
  Therefore, before using it, you should convert it into a machine language 
program by using the program TCOMP.110 (or any later version of TCOMP).  TCOMP 
is available in the DL4 database of the Compuserve Model 100 SIG.

     The following instructions can be used for loading and saving the program 
to the highest memory with TCOMP.  If you want to load the program elsewhere in
your Model 100, see the TCOMP documents, also available in DL4.

TO TURN COALA.100 INTO A MACHINE LANGUAGE PROGRAM:

     NOTE: Version 121 of TCOMP (and, perhaps, later versions as they are 
released) takes up a great deal  of RAM.  Combined with COALA, there is too 
much RAM used for TCOMP to automatically save COALA.CO.  These instructions are
modified to accomodate that fact.

     Additionally, different versions of TCOMP need a different amount of RAM 
cleared to load this program.  The number that changes is the one represented 
by "59778" in these instructions.  If the program fails to complete the 
compilation, try a lower number.

      1) Save any important files in your Model 100 to tape, as dealing with 
machine language programs can occasionally result in cold starts.

     2) Load COALA.100 and TCOMP and save them to RAM as you would any other 
BASIC programs.

     3) CSAVE both programs to cassette, so that you will still have them in 
the event of a cold start.

     4) Run TCOMP.  In answer to the first prompt, type
          59778 [ENTER]
In answer to the second prompt, press
          [ENTER]
In answer to the third prompt, type
          COALA [ENTER]
In answer to the fourth prompt, hit
          [ENTER]

     5) Wait.  It will take several minutes for the program to be compiled.  
However, this should be the only time you ever have to do this!

     6) At the "OK" prompt, you are done.  Four numbers will appear on the 
screen.  If you are using version 121 of TCOMP, the first three numbers will be
59778,62690,59778, and the last number will be 0.  If you are using another 
version of TCOMP, write down the numbers that appear, and use THEM in the 
following steps.

     7)Exit to MENU and then into BASIC.     8)Type SAVEM 
"COALA",59778,62960,59978.

COALA.CO will now be on your menu.  It is now READY TO RUN!  If you wish, you 
may KILL COALA.BA and TCOMP.


TO SAVE COALA.CO TO TAPE:

        In BASIC, type
          CSAVEM "COALA",59778,62960,59778


TO LOAD COALA.CO FROM TAPE:

     1) In Basic, type CLEAR 0,59778
     2) Type CLOADM "COALA"
     3) After the transfer is complete, type
          SAVEM "COALA",59778,62960,59778


OPERATING THE PROGRAM:

     The complete diagram at the end of this file will help you get around.
     After the title page, you will see a single dot in the center of the 
screen.  This is where drawing always starts, although by using the white keys 
you can start drawing anywhere.

SOME CAUTIONS:
     The CAPS LOCK key must be UP at all times.

     Except as noted below, DO NOT PRESS MORE THAN ONE KEY AT ONCE.

     You will hear a tone if you reach the edge of the screen, and a different 
tone if you push a key that is not a part of the program.

     You cannot see the paint brush move if painting white on white or black on
black.  The tone will tell you if you have reached a border, or you can briefly
revert from white to black or vice versa to see where you are.


THE CURSOR KEYS:

     "i" moves the brush up,
     "m" moves it down,
     "j" moves it left,
     "k" moves it right,
     "u","o","n", and "," move it toward their respective corners.

     You can hold a cursor key down continuously or tap it.  Alternately 
tapping two keys (such as "k" and "o") can create interesting effects.


THE BRUSHES:

     Pressing any brush key will allow you to draw with that brush until 
another brush key is pressed.  The brush that is in operation when the program 
begins in the "a" brush.

     BLACK BRUSHES:

     "a" and the row from "z" to "b" are solid black brushes of increasing 
widths.
     "s" is a double black stripe and "d" is a triple black stripe.

     WHITE BRUSHES:
     The white brushes mirror the black brushes.  "q" is the white equivalent 
of the "a" brush, and the row "1" through "5" is the white equivalent of the 
black row "z" through "b".
     Likewise, "w" is the double white stripe equivalent of the black "s" and 
"e" is the triple white stripe equivalent of the black "d".


CHECKERBOARD BRUSH:

     "f" will print a checkerboard over BOTH WHITE AND BLACK.  When painting 
diagonally with this, it may look like the double stripe brush "s", but, unlike
that one, it will cover white AND black areas.


SPECIAL BRUSH:

     "r" has two different effects.  After activating it, if a cursor key is 
held down continuously, it creates a ribbon-like look.  If the cursor key is 
tapped intermittently, it creates a random dot pattern.  Like the checkerboard 
key, the "r" key paints over black AND white.


ENDING THE PROGRAM:

     As a safety measure to avoid crashing a masterpiece prematurely, you must 
press TWO keys at once to end the program.  They are
          [GRPH] and "p"


     That's all there is to it!  Experiment and have fun!
