POOL is a machine-language pixel graphics demo based on an idea of Ken Marks's 
(see "Designer Screens" in the June '84 issue of 80 Micro): you watch the path 
of a perfectly elastic pool ball as it bounces around a rectangular table. Two 
"gimmicks" give the resulting graphics surprising complexity:

 1) While the ball moves in the northwest screen quadrant, mirror images of it 
also move simultaneously in the other three quadrants. When the quadrants 
overlap (you choose the size), the resulting "interference" patterns can be 
astonishing.

 2) The balls "flip" the pixels in their paths: that is, they turn "on" pixels 
"off", and vice versa.


POOL is a BASIC program - just RUN it & respond to the prompts. It creates a 
machine-language subroutine below HIMEM, so it shouldn't interfere w/ other ML 
programs. CAUTION: POOL is written for the M100 - DO NOT attempt to use it on 
the M200!


While the balls are moving, the following keys are active:

  ESC: hit "ESC" to return to the BASIC program.

  s: hit "s" (lowercase!) to "freeze" the display. The display will remain 
frozen until you hit "s" again, or ESC to return to BASIC.

  1-9: POOL can move the balls at one of 9 speeds. Hit a number key to change 
the speed. Speed "1" is the slowest, and CRAWLs. The speed roughly doubles from
each number to the next; speed 9 is really too fast to follow. The program 
begins at speed 6.


Hint: choose the table dimensions so that the quadrants overlap; also helps to 
make the horizontal dimension ALMOST a multiple of the vertical dimension.

If you find a particularly breathtaking configuration, share it!
