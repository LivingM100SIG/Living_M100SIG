	    MERRY.100 is a basic program created by the BASBLD.BA series of
    programs (which are excellent!) that loads the machine language program
    'MERRY.CO'.  This program is a TRUE multivoice or polyphonic music
    program producing three voice music.  Unfortunately, the primitive
    piezo speaker of the M-100 can't produce more than two voices...  so
    the output of this program is channeled through the cassette port.

	    To operate the program, first download the program ,load it
    into the M-100's BASIC interpreter and run it.  This should create the
    file 'MERRY.CO' available from the main menu.  Second, connect the
    cassette cable to the M-100's cassette port and plug the larger gray
    plug on the other end into a cassette recorder or an external amplifier
    (I prefer the latter, a small 9 volt RS#227-1008 B...  works great!).
    If a recorder is used, the music can either be listened to directly
    through headphones or a monitor feature OR recorded and played back.


	    Finally, select the program from the menu and enjoy the tune!
