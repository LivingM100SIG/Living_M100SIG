Documentation to gprint.cgp

this program uses files made from the
grfx.100 program in xa3 and draws them
on the radio shack cgp-115 color
graphic printer.
the following function are in use:

	2)draw line
	3)draw box
	6)draw circle
draw box filled; wasn't used to the
time involved & greatly decreased pen
life file 'gp-1' shows that the cgp-115
will draw past the bountries of the
model 100s' screen and even draw
figures not shown on the screen.
this is accomplished by drawing a
figure using the grfx.100 program and
using the 's' command "shift x,y" and
'shifting' the figure off the screen.
but the figure can still be printed by
the cgp-115 and the figure can be
merged with other figures using cut &
paste in the text mode.

if there are any questions, please use
email.  my work doesn't allow me to
'sign-on' every day.
...happy printing.
