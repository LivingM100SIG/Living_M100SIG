                 Canvas
        Model 100 Drawing Program

   Run the program, type a filename, do not include prefix, RAM: will affixed
automatically.  Even if you don't plan on saving on your file, type a filename
anyway just in case.  To simply draw, note the blinking dot in the center of
the screen, this will be your drawing cursor.  To move up hit E, to move down
hit X, to move left hit S, and to move right hit D.  This makes an ESXD diamond
on the left side of the keyboard.  To move diagonally hit W,Z,C, or R.  The
direction the diagonal is in respect to the corner of the diamond, i.e. R is off
of E and D.  So hitting R will take you up/right.
   Next, if you want to erase, hit the esc key, and move respectively.  As
well as cursor movement, when the erase function is active it works with the
other functions as well, box, line, and frame, which will be explained shortly.
   To stop erasing and start drawing again, hit esc again.
   To draw a frame, select one corner of the frame by moving towards it, and
stopping there.  Hit F.  Now you must move to the opposite corner of the frame
you desire.  By opposite corner the computer expects the DIAGONALLY opposite
corner.  Once you have reach the opposite corner hit F again.  Voila!  A
frame has appeared.  The frame can be as big, little, narrow, or fat as you
like.  To do a box (a filled in frame) do the same thing, except hitting B
instead of F.  To connect two points, the line function, it is a similar
procedure.  Select your point by moving there, hit L, then move to your other
point, hit L again.  They should now be connected by a line.  NOTE: When using
these functions, erase mode will be active when moving to your second point,
BUT the box, line, or frame will be drawn in the esc mode it was in when you
 selected the first point.  If you were in erase mode then the box, frame, or
line will be in erase mode, or vice versa.
   Hit [GRPH-C] to clear the screen.
   To create a framed equilateral triangle,
hit T.  Type a two digit size.  Example: If you want a size 7 triangle, type 07.
  If you want a size 15, then type 15.  Size 20 is about the maximum size.
   To activate the mirror function, hit M.  Imagine you now have have two
screens, separated by an imaginary line passing through the original center
point.  Everything you do one screen is duplicated on the other.  To shut it off hit M again.
   To create a filled in triangle follow the same directions for a framed triangle, except hit K, instead of T.
   To thicken and thin your brush, use the up and down arrow keys.  Up
thickens, and down thins the brush.  Brush thickness is limited to 32 pixels,
or until you hit the edge of the screen, whichever comes first.  Once the brush
is thicken, drawing, will not be one pixel wide, but however thick you want
it.  NOTE: Line, box, and frame are NOT affected by brush thickness.
   To write text on screen, first hit [CTRL-T].  Then indicate which line of
text you want to begin writing on, 1 upwards to line 7.  Tab, backspace, and
return will work fine, as will any graphics characters.  To stop writing,
hit [CTRL-T] again, and then you may continue drawing.  If you attempt to
write or tab or return past the 7th line, you will be returned to the first.
  To inverse the screen, that is turn it all black or all white, hit I.  To
reserve it, hit it again.  NOTE: Screen inverse erases what is on the screen,
it merely "blackens" or "whitens" the screen.
  Since the it can be tedious moving from one end of the screen to the other,
there is a direct coordinate access function.  Hit O, then type the x value,
and y value of your choice.  NOTE:  X must be THREE characters in length.  If
you wanted an X value of 52, then you would have to type 052.  Y must be TWO
characters in length, if you wanted a Y value of 1, you would have to type 01. 
Example: Coordinate wanted X:23 Y:34  What you type: 02334.  Your cursor will
now be in that position, this is extremely useful with the line, box, and
 frame commands.
   To save a program hit [CTRL-U], that will save it under your filename
 indicated in the beginning of the program.  HAVE PATIENCE, it is very
 slow, and memory consuming, sorry about that, but right now, the only pixel
 testing method I know of is not that fast.
   To load a file, when you run the program type the file name used before
 and hit [CTRL-L], the file will load.  This is very quick, it won't take nearly
 as long as a save.
   To printout a picture, hit [CTRL-P]. Select a printing method 1 or 2:
 Method 2:The dump is for a Gemini printer, but
 will probably work with most Epson compatibles,if not the printer codes are
 on line 190, and the codes I sent were a condensed code (15), and the line feed
code (27,51).  Adjustment for your printer should be simple.  The printout is
medium speed, be patient.
   Method 1: By user request, SCDUMP has been incorporated into the program.  BUT I do not know much about SCDUMP.  Yes, it is much faster, and yes it is more accurate.  But, I do not know how well it will work with this particular program, or how it will affect it.  Try it once and see what you think.  I make NO guarantees with the SCDUMP.
   To escape the program hit TAB.  You will have to type Y to verify exiting.
   Well that about sums it up, a
reference card is at the bottom, and I would like to point out that although I
made every precaution to trap errors, and miskeyed commands, I am sure if one
trys hard enough they can screw up the program.  I made this error proof, not
idiot proof, that is as long as you follow directions, you won't have any
 problems.  Also, don't ever worry about going off the screen, you will just
stop at the edge, no harm done.  I also realize it is impossible to explain some
 things, experiment!  I would appreciate comments, and constructive criticism.
