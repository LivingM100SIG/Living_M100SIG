INSTRUCTIONS FOR "FACES.100"
by Don Zeikel [CIS 75775,1430]

CAUTION!  THIS PROGRAM WILL RUN ON A MODEL 100 OR 102 -ONLY-.

If you make faces at your computer, now your computer has a chance to make 
faces at YOU.  This machine-language program contains menus of silly face parts
that can be combined to make 1,048,576 different faces.  You can even use it 
for police artist composite sketches, as long as the suspect is REAL GOOFY 
LOOKING.


LOADING THE PROGRAM

First, download FACECO.RLC.  You will also need RLCLDR.BA from DL7 to convert 
the file to a .CO file.  Because FACECO.RLC is over 15000 bytes, and the final 
.CO file is 7407 bytes, you will have to take a few extra steps to convert it. 
However, once you have the .CO file, you will only need FACECO.RLC if you want 
to create a copy at a different address, so you will only have to go through 
this lengthy process ONCE.

First, save FACECO.RLC, and any other valuable RAM files, to disk or cassette, 
as dealing with machine language files creates the possibility of a cold start.

TO CREATE FACES.CO COMPLETELY IN RAM

Load FACECO.RLC and RLCLDR.BA into RAM.  FACECO.RLC should be named FACECO.DO. 
If you are not going to be loading any other machine language programs at the 
same time you run FACES.CO, clear memory by entering BASIC and typing

CLEAR 256, 55552 [ENTER].

Otherwise, change 55552 to a lower number and make a note of it.
Then, run RLCLDR.BA.  At the first prompt, enter L or 1 for "load."  When it 
asks for a file name, enter FACECO.DO.  When it asks for start address, enter 
55552 or whatever number you jotted down.  It will start running.  The process 
will take several minutes, so you can go practice making faces in the mirror to
get in the mood.
Eventually, the program should beep and say "Done" followed by ?OM Error.  The 
latter is because of the lack of memory.
Type
KILL "FACECO.DO" [ENTER].

***
Type

SAVEM "FACES",HIMEM,HIMEM+7407,HIMEM [ENTER]

Go back to the MENU and you will see 	FACES.CO.  You can save the .CO file to
disk or cassette.  To save it to cassette, type

SAVEM"CAS:FACES",HIMEM,HIMEM+7407,HIMEM [ENTER]

To load it back later type

LOADM"CAS:FACES" [ENTER]

You can now skip to "RUNNING THE PROGRAM" below.


CREATING THE PROGRAM FROM DISK OR CASSETTE

If you want to use a FACECO.DO from disk or cassette (which would only be 
needed if you want to load it at a very low address), you MUST make one change 
in RLCLDR.BA.  This is PARTICULARLY important if you are using a Tandy Disk 
Drive with an operating system

Edit line 9 of RLCLDR by deleting EVERYTHING IN THE LINE AFTER
"DONE":
and adding END

Then, run RLCLDR.BA as in the instructions above.  When it beeps and says 
"Done," go up to the *** above and follow the same instructions.


RUNNING THE PROGRAM

Use function keys 1 through 5 (in any order) to choose menus of face parts.  
Move the cursor with the arrow keys, and press [ENTER] to select face parts.

End the program by using function key 8 or the ESC key.

Have fun!
