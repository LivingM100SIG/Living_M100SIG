Draw by George Saladino. 
.
Draw is a drawing program in machine 
language. It was written in basic and
compiled with TCOMP. It has a draw mode
which is turned on by pushing "D" and a
erase mode turned on by pushing "E".
.
The "CTRL" key draws up and the "SHIFT"
key draws down. The "<" draws left and
the ">" draws right. The "C" key clears
the screen. The "S" key restarts the
program. The "ESC" key ends the program 
and brings you back to the menu.
A combination of pushing down the 
direction keys produces Diagonal lines.
(Note: The erase dot shows only when the
direction keys are held down.)
.
The pushing of the "F" key when starting
produces super fast drawing. Mostly
to show how fast a compiled program 
speeds up operations. (A bit fast for
ease in drawing)
.
Pushing the "N" key when starting puts
the program in the normal speed of
drawing. This speed allows you to draw
with ease.
.
The erase feature is slower in both fast
mode and normal mode.
