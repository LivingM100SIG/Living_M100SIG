This text is written for those people
who would like to write their own
simulated multivoice music. It assumes
you can understand some basic music
terms as well as read music.

My two Xmas music programs in XA3 were
written shortly after I created this
technique. It is not that old and I
hope that it can be improved by others.
Please refer to those pieces to see
how it is augmented.

#1) DEFINING THE NOTES
To simplify calling up the notes in
sequence and conserve memory I set up
a 1 dimsnl array called S(x), where
x varies from 1 to 48. This defines 4
octaves of notes from low f# to high
g#. See Model 100 manuel page 180 for
chart. Since each octave has 12 notes
(including # and b), the 48 notes give
you a range of 4 octaves. So your
program sould start as follows:
10 Dim S(48)
15 For X=48 To 1 Step-1:ReadS(X):NextX
20 Data 415,439,etc.
Continue to write data lines to include
all the pitchs on page 180 (from 415
to 6269)

You now have 4 octaves to choose from.
Your selections are as follows:

       HIGH.................LOW
NOTE  OCT#1  OCT#2  OCT#3  OCT#4
F#,Gb S(48)  S(36)  S(24)  S(12)
F     S(47)  S(35)  S(23)  S(11)
E     S(46)  S(34)  S(22)  S(10)
D#,Eb S(45)  S(33)  S(21)  S(9)
D     S(44)  S(32)  S(20)  S(8)
