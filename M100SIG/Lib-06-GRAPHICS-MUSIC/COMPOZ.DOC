For those of you who've been trying to figure out Ron Johnson's COMPOZ program, I offer the following hints.  These may seem less 
cryptic if you first read my SOUND.DOC file on XA3.

COMPOZ is a translator program.  It converts a file (SONG.DO) (presumably supplied by you) into a file (any legal name) for MUPLAY 
to read/play.

It won't work right if you download it in uppercase-only.

You have to provide SONG.DO.  This requires that you code some song.  Notes on format follow.

COMPOZ uses the M100 SOUND generator charts, except:
  flats, not sharps
  four notes are added at the bottom		(E-flat and up)
  octaves are labelled 0 to 5
  the bottom note in each octave is		E-flat

COMPOZ expects SONG.DO to begin with an indication of tempo.  Any (positive) decimal number will be accepted (ie, 1.32 is legal), 
but 2.0 is too high.  Smaller values are faster.  Try 1.0 to start, and experiment.

Follow "tempo" with a comma.

Most notes can be represented with three characters. C2Q is a quarter note, (middle) C (octave 2); b1W is a whole note, B-flat (
octave 1); etc.  FORMAT: p0d, where p=pitch, 0=octave, & d=duration.  A thru G, as usual (but note where the octaves break),; flats 
are lower-case; T(hirty-second),S,E,Q,H,W(hole).  Clear enough?

Notes must be separated by commas.

R0x will generate a rest of "x" length.

Dotted and irregular rhythms can be generated by addition.  (Really!)  D3H+Q is a dotted half, D; e0W+W+W is a three-measure tied 
note (almost certainly out of bounds, by the way), E-flat.  Get the picture?

COMPOZ translates this notation into a file which MUPLAY reads/plays.

That should get you started.

LOVE.CPZ is an example of what SONG.DO should look like.  It's "What Wondrous Love is This" from Walker's SOUTHERN HARMONY, for you 
shape-note singers.


Compare my SINGER.100 for a different solution.
