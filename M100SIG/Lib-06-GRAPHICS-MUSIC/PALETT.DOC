                        PALETTE
           A graphics program for the M100
               -----------------------
        PALETTE combines the abilities and concepts of three outstanding M100 
SIG programs: CANVAS.BA by Seth Kaplan, CIRCLE.CO by Jon Diercks and QIKDMP.BA 
by George Flanders. These programs integrate to provide a powerful, 
comprehensive and EASY TO USE graphics program which:
-
        -DRAWS lines, boxes, triangles, frames and circles automatically 
anywhere on the entire screen.(CANVAS/CIRCLE)
-
        -SAVES instantly and storably ALL 15360 pixel addresses for immediate 
recall or future use in 1932 byte .CO files. (QIKDMP)
-
        -PRINTS out current or saved graphics in under a minute. (QIKDMP)
-
        Please read ALL these instructions before you use PALETTE. They're not 
complicated and they are logical but PALETTE is a comprehensive program and 
you'll be lost if you don't know what's going on. Refer to these instructions 
often.
-
SETUP:
        To use the program you'll need three files; PALETT.DOC (this file), 
PALETT.100 and PALLDR.100. Download the files and edit all the garbage. 
Checksum them as .DO files using the checksums in the file DES. SAVE a .BA 
version of PALETT. Split PALLDR.100 at line 259 into two programs and run each 
to create QIKDMP.CO & CIRCLE.CO. (Save the loaders for future use. These are 
the same programs available elsewhere on the SIG.) 
        QIKDMP.CO runs from addresses 54000 to 54239 and uses 54245 to 56164 as
a storage buffer. I use 56165 to 56170 for storage of information relative to 
PALETTE's use of each graphic file.
        CIRCLE.CO runs in the ALT/LCD buffer so should not conflict with 
anything (other than displacing another ALT/LCD program).
        PALETTE therefore uses addresses 54000 to 56170 and needs 1932 bytes of
space for each saved graphic so give it some RAM running space and be sure to 
eliminate any M/L conflicts before you run it. PALETTE will let you know if you
are out of additional graphic file storage space when you run it. All stored 
graphics files use a ] as the last character and ONLY those files will display 
on the directory of loadable files when you run PALETTE. Be sure and have all 
three files: PALETT.BA, QIKDMP.CO and CIRCLE.CO in RAM when running PALETTE; 
you'll use them all. (Of course you would ALSO need in RAM whatever screen 
print program you use if NOT QIKDMP. See below.)
-
Using PALETTE:
        When you run PALETTE you will first come to it's main menu. Press <N> 
to begin a new graphic; enter a new name, 1 to 5 characters, and PALETTE will 
add the final ] for you. <P> will display all suitable graphics files currently
in RAM and prompt for a filename. The first time you run PALETTE, the space 
after the "Graphic name" prompt will be blank; type in your title. Each 
subsequent use will show the name of the LAST used graphic. Press ENTER to load
that file or type your choice (ALWAYS include the ].)
        If you've selected <N>ew then you'll see a blank screen and the built-
in pixel finder will flash at location 120,32. If you've chosen a <P>revious 
graphic it will display immediately with the pixel finder at your last drawing 
location.
-
        To DRAW you'll use keys W E R, S D, Z X C to move the pixel. You can 
press Q anytime for the Quick reference chart or use the one below for their 
directions: they're fairly ergonomic.
        You can move the drawing pixel around the screen three ways:
        -You can draw with it by dribbling it across the screen leaving a trail
of set pixels in your chosen design.
        -You can press TAB and leave a trail of "reversed" pixels until you've
stepped your way to your desired location where you'll press TAB again and do 
something at the new location.
        -You can do a "pixel jump" to pre-chosen coordinates by pressing O and 
typing in the new X,Y coordinates.
-
        (NOTE: keys  shown with a (t) in front of the description are TOGGLES; 
just press the key again to turn the attribute on or off. Use UPPER-CASE 
letters for all control sequences; ANY character when in PALLETTE's TEXT mode. 
If you try to do something that won't work PALETTE will flash "OUT OF RANGE!, 
beep and resume. I suppose it is possible to frustrate the error routine and if
that happens see the remarks under CTRL X for saving your work.)
-
    (t) TAB toggles between "white" and black pixels. This works on all 
routines. If you press TAB BEFORE you leave a desired design it will erase the 
last location. (This is useful when "jumping" from a location where you DON'T 
want to leave a dot behind.)  Use it also to erase entries.
        Creative use of BLACK/WHITE pixels and shapes will let you do all kinds
of overlays and effects; black circles inside white shapes, white letters on 
black designs etc. Use your imagination!
-
        UP/DOWN arrow keys (above DEL/BKSP) control the size of your "pixel 
brush". Sizes are 1 pixel wide to 43, in increments of 2, operationally limited
only by the distance from the brush's center pixel to the closest screen edge 
parallel to your brush movement axis. (huh?)
        When using the diagonal pixel movement keys, W R Z C, the orientation 
of a thickened brush will match the last direction of vertical or horizontal 
movement. (Try it, you'll see.)  Brush width will remain at the chosen 
thickness when doing frames, lines and circles; the center line of the pixel 
brush is the coordinate used by the drawing routines. Triangles are one pixel 
wide; manually thicken them to taste.
-
        P - will show you where the drawing pixel is at any time by flashing
 circles at your last pixel location and displaying it's coordinates.
-
    (t) Q - will display a mini help screen to remind you of key functions.
-
        O - Use to jump directly to a new location. (Pixel locations run in X,Y
format from 0,0 which is the upper left corner to 239,63 at the lower right.) 
At the X prompt enter THREE characters; 002, 02sp or 2spsp are all OK. At the Y
prompt enter TWO characters. (X<240 and Y<64!). Confirm your choice with Y or N
and away you go.
        Note: When drawing Lines, Boxes and Frames a reminder of the routine 
you're using will display on the left side of your screen and "dribbles", 
although they show your path to the other coordinate if you don't "jump" 
directly, will not be recorded.
-
        L - Press L when at one end of a desired LINE. Dribble or jump to the 
other end, press L and there's your line. You'll then HEAR a reminder to press 
Y (yes) or N (no) about keeping what you just drew.
-
        B - To draw a solid box locate one corner, press B, move to the 
opposite corner, press B, and behold; a box. Respond Y or N and continue.
-
        F - Frame is drawn the same way: locate a corner, press F, locate the 
other corner, press F, then Y or N.
-
        T or K - Press to draw an open (T) or closed (K) triangle. Choose the 
location for the center and press T or K. You'll be prompted for a size: enter 
TWO digits from 1 (0n or Nsp OK) to 62 pixels high (at Y=32); then press Y or 
N.
-
    (t) I - Reverses all pixels and switches pixel color.
-
        H - This will draw a circle and/or fill it in. Answer the r? with a TWO
digit radius (again 0n or Nsp OK): at the audio prompt you have THREE choices; 
Y/N/F (to Fill in the circle).  When you're satisfied, press Y.
-
    (t) CTRL T - You can enter text and ANY graphics characters directly on 
your graphic at the cursor location nearest your drawing pixel. Choose pixel 
color, press CTRL T, verify the location (CTRL T out and try another location 
if you need to), and type. Only DEL/BKSP and CR will work as usual. Press CTRL 
T when done.
-
        NOTE: The Border and Guide routines described below can work together 
but they set their pixel colors independently. Keep toggling them until you 
achieve the desired effect.
-
    (t) CTRL B - This will place a solid Border around the screen with reversed
pixels. Keep in mind that graphics along the edges will be lost if you toggle 
in and out of the border.
-
    (t) CTRL G - This will display a reference Guide frame with pixels reversed
beginning at 0,10 / 10,0 and at 10 pixel intervals to X250,Y60. When used with 
Border described above you can serrate a solid border.
-
        CTRL K - This will SAVE your graphic to a 1932 byte .CO file for future
use and return you to PALETTE's main menu. USE IT OFTEN! Although PALETTE is 
constantly writing your graphic to it's screen buffer, YOU must save the buffer
to a discrete .CO file. You can quickly return to your graphic by pressing <P> 
at the main menu then <ENTER>; voila'.
-
        CTRL X - This takes you directly to PALETTE's main menu WITHOUT saving 
your screen to a file. If you should press it by accident DONT'T PANIC! To save
the graphic to a file, go to BASIC and type SAVEM"name ]",54245,56170 <ENTER>. 
(remember the last ] .)
-
        GRPH C - This will reload your current file AS STORED at the last CTRL 
K. It's useful if you just want to start over with a graphic.
-
        CTRL P - This calls the printer dump of QIKDMP.CO on line 202 of 
PALETT.BA. Verify edge of screen attributes (Border or Guide) BEFORE you print.
What you see is what you print!
        You MUST read George Flander's complete discussion of setting up QIKDMP
for YOUR printer which is contained in QIKDMP.100/DL6. The loader I've included
in this package has all of George's codes as supplied, so find the setup codes 
he discusses and change whatever you need to. (Line 360 of PALLDR.BA)
        The printer routine operates INDEPENDENTLY of the LCD routine so you 
can use PALETTE right away while working to make your printer compatable. If 
you use another graphic dump routine you can call it at line 202. (e.g.Users of
Gene Nestro's XCOPY.CO (DMPDMP.BA/DL7), substitute RUNM"XCOPY" for CALL54053.)

CREDITS:
        Seth Kaplan wrote the original CANVAS.BA in 1985 and it's been a 
popular program on this SIG. I've heavily modified it for PALETTE and added 
bells and whistles. I've made extensive use of George Flander's advice and 
QIKDMP screen routines in addition to John Dierck's CIRCLE.CO. Any credit goes 
to them. THANK YOU!
        Send comments and problems to me at 73267,552. HAVE FUN!
