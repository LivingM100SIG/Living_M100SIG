	The MUSIC program allows you to 
easily make songs on the Model 100 using
the SOUND command.  Musical notation is 
entered into a document file in a form 
that can be read by the computer.  It is
then compiled by the MUSIC program which
generates a basic program that plays the
music.

	The MUSIC source file has the 	
following format:

N[S]<^I>	O<^I>		L[.]<^M>

Where:					

Open characters are required.

Characters inside of brackets ([]) are 
optional.

Required unprintable characters are 
shown as control characters between the 
less than (<) and the greater than (>) 
symbols.

N is a letter A through G, uppercase or 
lowercase that corresponds to the note 
you want.  An uppercase or lowercase S 
can follow the note to indicate that it 
is to be sharp.  An F or any other 
letter can follow the note to indicate 
that it is flat.  The note >MUST< be 
followed by a control I (TAB).		

O is a number 0 through 5 that indicates
the octive of the note.  If you wish to 
have a rest in the music, type a valid 
note in the note column and type a 0 for
the octive.  The octive >MUST< be 
followed by a control I (TAB).

L is a number that corresponds to the 
fractional portion of the length value. 
If the note or rest is a one-quarter 
value, type 4; if it is a half-rest, 
type 2; if it is a thirty-second note, 
type 32, ect.  The number may be 
followed by a period to increase the 
length value.  A dot will add one-half 
the length value to the length.  For 
instance, a three-quarter rest would be 
a 2., and a dotted sixteenth note would 
be 16., ect.  The length value >MUST< be
followed by a control M (ENTER).

Any line that is incorrect will be made 
a comment line in the finished program. 
It is a good idea to mark measures and 
lyrics this way.

	Here is an example of a music 
document file:

CS	3	1
Ds	3	1
B	3	1
b	2	1
GF	2	1.

	And here is an example of the 
program document file that was generated
from it:

 10 SOUND 2216 , 64 
 20 SOUND 1975 , 64 
 30 SOUND 2484 , 64 
 40 SOUND 4968 , 64 
 50 SOUND 3321 , 96 

	For easier typing, press the NUM
key until it locks so you can enter the 
numbers faster.  The program will take 
both upper and lowercase, so you don't 
need to press the SHIFT key.
