	Have you ever wanted to say something about yourself in a message, but
weren't quite sure how to? 

	Back when I worked in academic computing, I used a mainframe computer
network called the Because Its There Network (BITNET). When Bitnauts (as we
called ourselves) sent personal Email, we'd close with one of these:

:-)     I'm happy

:-(     I'm sad

<:-)    I feel stupid

;-)     Wink!

:-#     Oops -- shouldn't have said that

:-$     I feel sick...

:-&     I'm angry

:-*     Kiss!

:-[     I'm very sad

&:-)    I have curly hair

@:-)    I have wavy hair

:-*)    I've got a mustache

%-)     I've got a headache

:-D     I've very happy

B-)     I'm Batman!

8-)     I wear glasses
