	PEEKCH.100 is a short (1293 bytes) BASIC program which receives 
keyboard entry of any printable ASCII value in the M-100 character set, and 
produces a three-part display that analyzes the pixel makeup of that character.
(Checksum=109,589). The program is a "seeing is believing" tutorial on how 
characters are printed on the screen, written as an aid to those who are 
working on applications which involve reading bytes under the cursor as 
reported in high RAM locations -20 to -15; e.g., screen dumps, bit mapping and 
the like. If you are helping a youngster learn, you'll especially like 
PEEKCH.100. After each character entry, the following elements appear on the 
LCD:

	(1) On the left third of the screen, the values held in locations -20 
to -15 are displayed and the CHR$ value being polled is recorded. (2) At center
screen, a large 6 x 8 pixel representation of the character appears. (3) At 
right, the binary equivalents of each of the six bytes which describe the 
character are presented in vertical format, duplicating the center graphic.

	Each byte is reproduced slowly enough in all three displays to aid 
comprehension. To slow the sequences even more, increase the range of the D 
loop in line 6 beyond 300. Happy PEEKing!
