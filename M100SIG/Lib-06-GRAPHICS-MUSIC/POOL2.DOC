POOL.100 is a fine little program.  
Significant improvements were made in 
POOL.101  I found some other things to do
to make 
POOL.102  The differences come in the 
file handling department.  The program 
used to open PATS.DO for append 
regardless of whether you wanted to save
any patterns.  Now PATS.DO is only 
appended when you want to save a 
pattern.
An additional selection has been added 
to the menu as well.  You may now LOAD a
pattern saved in PATS.DO  If you select 
the "L" option, you will be asked for a 
pattern number to load.  This is the 
line number in PATS.DO that you want to 
run.  If you select a number greater 
than what is in the file, the menu will 
return with no error message.  If you 
select to load a pattern and PATS.DO 
does not exist, you will receive an error
message, and then the menu again.
  Because of the load feature, the 
structure of PATS.DO has been changed.  
What were slashes ("/") as data 
separators, are now commas.  Because of 
this I have also included a sample 
PATS.DO in the new format.
  Have fun and write me if you have any 
problems
