 *Most of the time if you don't want to change any information then just press [
ENTER] and it will keep it the same as before.

[F] File procedures
 [1] Load & Append graphic primitive
  File name? .do file
  Graphic primitive name? example (CUBE, TRIANGLE or PYRAMID)
  Offset image? Y/N    Scale image? Y/N
   If primitive not found try searching the file [2] else check capitol letters.

 [2] Search file
  File name? .do file
   Searchs file and displays each name of graphic primitive, lines per 
primitive. Example: Cube  18 lines
 [3] Save file
  File name? .do file
   Don't save to main graphic primitive file it will write over the file and you
will lose all the other primitives.  Save to dummy file.  Move by pasting 
primitive to main primitive file.  Try to round [C][5] off before you save file,
cuts down on file size.
 [4] Reset counter
  New counter? nn (0-99)
   To change counter or reset for new image (load doesn't set counter to 0 
instead appends primitive to image file)
[A] Enter linepoints & reset counter
  C? 1=starts a new line  0=endpoint  9=exit
  X? -119 to 119  Y? -32 to 32  Z? -50 to 50
   Example: draw a line from x=10 y=10 z=10 to x=-10 y=10 z=10 to x=-10 y=-10 
z=10 (draws a L) would be:
    1, 10, 10, 10
    0,-10, 10, 10
    0,-10,-10, 10
   To make a square add:
    0, 10,-10, 10
    0, 10, 10, 10
   Y is vertical, X is horizontal and Z is depth
[B] Same as Add except doesn't reset counter
[C] Change image
  [1] Insert line
   Line number? 1 to End
   C, X, Y & Z?
    Inserts before the specified line number.
  [2] Delete lines
   Starting line number?
   Number of lines?
    Deletes from starting line number to starting line plus number of lines.  If
starting plus number is larger than counter then delete to end of file.
  [3] Offset lines
   Starting line number?
   Number of lines?
   X offset, Y offset & Z offset
    Offsets from starting line to starting + number.  Move lines depending on 
x,y & z offsets.
  [4] Scale lines
   Same as Offset except it scales the lines.
  [5] Round off file
   Used so the file will be smaller when saved.
[D] Edit image file
  [Up arrow] Reverse listing
  [Down arrow] Forward listing
  [V] Move listing forward once
   List linepoints in image file
  [Left arrow] Column left
  [Right arrow] Column right
   Change cursor position horizontal to be used with [C] (see below)
  [C] Change C, X, Y or Z depending on line number & column position *.
  [D] Display image file (see [E] Display image below)
  [E] Edit line.  Can change entire line.
  [N] New line number
  [R] Rubber band
   Line number?
   Change X, Y or Z
    Can change all lines which are at one given point to another different 
point.
  [S] Draw specified lines from starting line to starting + number of lines.
  [T] Change Image (Go see [C] change image up)
  [Q] Exit
[E] Display image
  [I] [O] Rotate on Z axis
  [K] [L] Rotate on Y axis
  [<] [>] Rotate on X axis
   Rotates & draws resulting image.  Doesn't clear screen (compare last image to
new image)
  [C] Clears screen & redraws image
  [M] Change display parameters
   [1] Angle of rotation
   [2] Reference points to rotate around
   [3] Point of view
    To get best image keep Z from -50 to around -200.
  [N] Clears screen only
  [Q] Exit

Notes on graphic primitive files.
  PRIM.DO used as file name
  All primitives must have a name (CUBE, PYRAMID, TRIANGLE) 1 to 8 characters.
  Each primitive must have as an end 2,0,0,0
  Example:c,x,y,z
SQUARE
1,10,10,10
0,-10,10,10
0,-10,-10,10
0,10,-10,10
0,10,10,10
2,0,0,0

  Between each primitive an [ENTER] must be present except at start and end of 
file.
  There are many improvements that can be made like hidden line removal, window 
clipping and maybe speeding the line drawing up (spends around 66 percent just 
drawing the lines).
  If the coordinates lies outside of the screen then it will not display the 
line (no window clipping).
  If file doesn't load check primitive name (has to be exact) or see if enough 
data in file.
