	ORGAN.CO turns your Model 100 into a real, useable
single-voice musical instrument.  Each note sounds for as long as
you hold down a key.  It has a range of nearly five octaves.  The
keys are laid out in an arrangement that is easy for piano players
to use.

	HOW TO INSTALL ORGAN.CO:

	1.  Save all your important files to tape in case of cold
start.

	2.  Download CHANGE.BA by Rick Perry from DL4.  Save it on
tape.  It's very useful.

	3.  Download ORGAN.CO.  Check to make sure there are no extra
garbage characters at the beginning or end.

	4.  Run CHANGE.BA.  Position the cursor over the text file you
downloaded from ORGAN.CO.

	5.  Press F2 (">BIN").  At the prompt ".CO output file?"
enter "ORGAN".

	6.  Wait 3 minutes or so.  (Go play a record.)

	7.  At the prompt "Kill hex input file?" type "Y".

	8.  Hit F8 ("Menu").  You're done.

	HOW TO SAVE ORGAN.CO ON TAPE:

	HOW TO PLAY THE ORGAN:

	Try the following keys:  ESC, TAB CTRL a z s x d c v g b h n 
j ,
	Now hold down SHIFT or CAPS LOCK and try them again.
	Now try 1 q 2 w 3 e r 5 t 6 y 7 u i o p [ = BKSP with and without
SHIFT.

	z is middle C, s is C#, x is D, d is D#, c is E, and so on,
like the black and white keys on a piano.  F and K don't do
anything because there's no black key there.

	A TUNE TO TRY:

	(Note:  <ESC> is the ESC key, <TAB> is the TAB key. Don't use
the SHIFT or CAPS LOCK key for this tune)
