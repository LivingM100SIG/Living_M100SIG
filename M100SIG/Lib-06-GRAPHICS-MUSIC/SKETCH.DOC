Docmentation file for SKETCH.BA, GRAFIX.CO, and LDGRFX.BA by Robert

SKETCH.BA and GRAFIX.CO work together to provide dot-by-dot M100 LCD screen
pixel editing, 12 sizes of screen dumps (for Epson 9 pin or compatible
printers), saving of screen images to PICTUR.CO filenames assigned by the
user, and retrieval/re-editing of any of those PICTUR.CO files from RAM.

The PICTUR.CO files created by SKETCH/GRAFIX have a 0 execution address so
they will return you to the M100 main menu if accidently loaded
(inadvertantly using the cursor bar on them).  The machine language program
GRAFIX.CO will be 2809 bytes long (including a 1920 byte buffer for the
PICTUR.CO saving function).  The resulting saved PICTUR.CO files are
each only 1920 bytes long.

The GRAFIX.CO program is CALLed by SKETCH.BA as a way of providing
graphics screen prints in any of 12 different Height and Width
combinations.  The 1 wide X 1 high printout is great for printing a small
logo at the top of a page with a letterhead.  The 4 wide X 4 high
printout will almost fill the paper and is great for scientific graph
printouts.  GRAFIX.CO does not reset all the printer settings so, when
finished, you will not have to reset your margins, bold, etc.  Hitting
Shift-Break while printing will return control to the M100 program but your
printer may be locked in graphics mode requiring you to turn it off and back
on to completely clear it.

LOADING:
--------
Download LDGRFX.BA in .DO format.  In BASIC, type LOAD"LDGRFX".  When loaded,
type SAVE"LDGRFX".  Then with LDGRFX.BA created and stored in RAM, you may type
KILL"LDGRFX.DO" to recover some memory space.

Run LDGRFX.BA to create the GRAFIX.CO program.  LDGRFX.BA asks you to choose
where in memory GRAFIX.CO will always load and run.  If you don't want it up
under the current HIMEM, choose a starting address so the required 2807
bytes of memory will not conflict with any other machine language program
which you may wish to have active at the same time (like your Disk Operating
System).  When the loading is complete, you are offered two user determined
configuration choices:

1.  Want Linefeeds sent to your printer upon printouts <Y/N>?  Some people set
their printers to automatically throw in a linefeed every time it sees a
carriage return.  If so, then chose <N>.  If you want the program to supply the
needed linefeeds, choose <Y>.

2.  Set printer linespacing value.  Most Epson compatible printers use 24
(actually 24/180 inch).  Printers using other values for their graphics
vertical line spacing include the Gemini-10X which uses 16.  If you don't know
about your printer, use the "24" default value and see if the printouts have
spaces or overlaps in the print.

If you later decide to change these values or wish GRAFIX to operate at a
different address, you will have to run LFGRFX.BA again.  SKETCH.BA is designed
to find GRAFIX.CO in RAM and extract the CALL addresses it needs prior to
running.  PICTUR.CO files made with previous versions of GRAFIX.CO will be
compatible with the new version.

RUNNING:
--------
Download SKETCH.BA in .DO format.  In BASIC, type LOAD"SKETCH".  When loaded,
type SAVE"SKETCH".  Then with SKETCH.BA created and stored in RAM, you may type
KILL"SKETCH.DO" to recover some memory space.

RUN the SKETCH.BA progam.  At the first menu, press Enter to continue with
LOADMing of GRAFIX.CO into high memory.  The HIMEM value will be set
automatically.  At the MAIN MENU, choose <I> for instructions.  After reading
these, choose <N> to create a new picture.  The dot will start at the
upper left corner.  Move the dot around with the keypad directors.  The space
bar toggles it on and off.

When ready to Save or Print the screen contents, hit </> to bring up the
GRAFIX choices on line 8 of the picture.  You may then choose: 

<Q>uit returns you to Editing where you left off.
<P>rint will prompt you for your choices of Height multiple, then Width
multiple desired.  When the Width choice is entered, the printout begins.  If
it dosen't, check that your printer may be offline.  If so, put it online to
begin.
<S> to make a SAVE.  When GRAFIX completes a screen scan, it clears the
screen and asks you to <1> choose a filename for saving, <2> return to
editing the same sketch, or <3> returning to the Main Menu.  Choosing
<3> for Main Menu will ERASE your picture so be wure to SAVE your work
first!  Using the same filename as an existing filename will overwrite the
old copy.  Make frequent saves and even change filenames if you wish to save
different copies of the same picture.  When saving is complete, you are left
in BASIC.  Hit <F4> to RUN SKETCH again, or <F8> toto go to the M100 Main Menu.


To work on an old file or to get it on the screen so you can print it, choose
<E> at the SKETCH Main Menu.  When asked for a filename, enter the name of your
picture file in RAM (don't use the extension).  If SKETCH.BA can't find
it, it will tell you.  If found, your picture file will unfold onto the
screen and leave you in dot editing mode.  TOGGLE the dot on/off with the
<SPACEBAR> to help locate it.

Notes and Hints:

Use the Ctrl+ARROW keys then the <D> combination as a quick way to draw
lines, borders, etc.

The Shift+ARROWS moves the dot 16 pixel at a time up/down and 12 pixels left/
right so, if started from an edge, it can be helpful in choosing where to
place text (text chrs. are 8 dots high x 6 dots wide).

When using the <D>raw function, that the second <D> can be cancelled by hitting
Cntrl-D.

The <T>ext function is also handy for making selective erasures.  Just put
the dot near where you wish to erase, hit <T>, then use the spacebar to print
spaces over the graphics.  Once erased this way, however, the dot graphics are
gone.  You will have to redraw them if wanted (or Edit your recently saved
RAM file again).  If you hit <T> and then change your mind, just hit <ENTER>
to finish and get back to dot editing without having put any text over the
graphics.

Using Shft-Grph-x in the <T>ext mode will can quickly fill the screen with
full characters of all dots.

To conserve RAM, the SKETCH.BA program can be shortened by:
1.  Editing out the instructions (just change line 585 to BEEP:GOTO335 and
 delete lines 590-695).
2.  Removing the LINE commands (but not from line #555).
3.  Editing out all remarks and all lines which contain only remarks.

Have fun!
