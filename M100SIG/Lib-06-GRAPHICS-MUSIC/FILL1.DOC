FILL1.RLC is a compiled (using TCOMP) subroutine to fill a shape drawn with 
Model 100/102 graphics.  It can be loaded into memory using RLCLDR.BA in DL7.  
It should be loaded no higher than MAXRAM-1638-1 (or HIMEM-1638-1 if you want 
to keep an existing file).
 
To use the routine, do the following:  Draw the outline of the shape using PSET
or LINE commands.  Make sure the shape is completely enclosed.  Locate a point 
("seed point") in the middle of the shape with a PRESET(x,y).  CALL the 
routine.  (Address will be the start address assigned in RLCLDR.)
 
NOTES:
    There is nothing to trap the fill from going off the edge of the screen.  
If your seed point is outside your shape strange results may occur.  If your 
seed point is ON the outline, the fill will occur both inside any out.  If you 
are unsure of where your seed point is, you'd be best to draw a line around the
screen: LINE(0,0)-(239,63),1,B
    Most any shape should be filled correctly, but there is an upper limit to 
shape complexity.  The routine will only work in 18 places at once.  Anything 
beyond this will have areas unfilled.
 
Example program: (Be sure to change line 30 to the address you started loading 
at)
 
5 LOADM"FILL1"
10 CLS:LINE(16,16)-(47,47):LINE-(26,47):LINE-(21,30):LINE-(24,50)
15 LINE-(21,50):LINE-(16,16)
20 PRESET(22,32)
30 CALL59000
 
Paste the following into previous example for an example of an overly complex 
shape:
10 CLS:LINE(10,10)-(10,22):LINE(200,20)-(200,32)
15 Y=10:PSET(10,Y):FORX=10TO200STEP20:LINE-(X,Y):LINE-(X+10,Y+10):NEXT
17 Y=22:PSET(10,Y):FORX=10TO200STEP20:LINE-(X,Y):LINE-(X+10,Y+10):NEXT
20 PRESET(11,12)
 
    I'm hoping to write a shorter and probably faster routine, but that's 
something for another time.
 
Comments or questions to Neil Wick [71056,613].  Thanks to my brother, Dale, 
who originally wrote the routine
