OVAL.100 and OVAL.200 are hexadecimal files, and needs HXFER.100 or HXFER.200
to convert it to a .CO file.
The 200 version of OVAL loads at 63576(in altLCD area), but the 100 version 
loads at 62582(in HIMEM area).  If this is conflicting with other machine 
language programs, you can relocate it to run it at a different address, by 
specifying that address while converting it with HXFER.

OVAL will let you draw elipses, as well as circles, by specifying different 
radius for each axis.
You can even fill the ovals, in black or white.

To use it,
CALL it with the following parameters:
(Be sure it's LOADMed first)

1. Mode in the A register:
	0 = black, unfilled
	1 = black, filled
	2 = white, unfilled
	3 = white, filled

2. Center point in the HL register:
	H=X coordinate
	L=Y coordinate

3. Y radius in altLCD, X radius in altLCD+1.
For 100, altLCD = 64704
For 200, altLCD = 63574

As an example, to draw a filled black oval, 41 pixels wide by 31 pixels tall,
 its center at (120,32), do the following:

POKE altLCD,15		'Y radius
POKE altLCD+1,20	'X radius
CALL TOP,1,(120*256)+32  'at (120,32)

TOP is the address where OVAL.CO is LOADMed.

Enjoy!
