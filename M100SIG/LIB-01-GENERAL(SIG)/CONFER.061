(LARRY L) Can someone give me a quick rundown of how the DOS is accessed on the
 M100?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Which DOS?? There are at least five.
(LARRY L) how bout the "stock" dos's from tandy and PCSG>
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm ,,,, though I'll let Mike take a shot at answering
  methinks that Woods Martin would be best on the D/VI and Tim Ekdom on the
  Chipmunk.
(Mike A.) Chipmunk DOS loads with Reset button and transfers the M/L DOS which
 can be programmed via Basic additons. definitely M/L pushed to the limits, but
 adds Basic words so you can write programs yourself..that answer the Q?
(LARRY L) I just got an AJ microdrive which uses an invisible M/L prog with
 basic commands. but there seems to be a conflict with PCSG RAM...but the
 techie there says there is a fix in the works.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Larry all of that stuff is beyond me. we have a LOT of techie
  information in the DL 4 area, including a complete System Map of the 100 that
  takes up about 100K and also some smaller files with details on RST stuff
  Now DaveW here may be able to help too. Dave, query is on accessing various
  DOS from the Model 100.
(LARRY L) what method is used to store the dos for the two major drives?
 rom or M/L?
(DaveW.) Can't entirely speak for TDD. however, Chipmunk is stored in ROM and
 automatically uploaded to RAM in M/L form when the M100 is reset.
 All DOS's are m/l. 
(Sysop Tony) All the "DOS's" (which are not really DOS's) are written in
 machine language code.  Some of them move MAXRAM to protect themselves, some
 only move HIMEM.
(LARRY L) thats what i was gettin at..how they avoid conflicts.
(DaveW.) How do they avoid conflicts with other m/l programs? Is that the
 question, Larry?
(LARRY L) yes
(DaveW.) Just as Tony explained, however, that does not insure lack of conflict
 if the other m/l programs are written for the same area of memory and are not
 relocatable (the majority would cause conflicts.) Other conflicts can come in
 even if the programs storage space is not the same. That is the new m/l
 program may try to use the same hooks as the DOS.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) if you haven't yet got hold of the FLIPML.100 and .DOC program
 from DL 4, I suggest that you do so. It is a big help in keeping M/L files out
 of each others way.


(Mike A.) Dave, how's about telling us about the trip out west..TS-land, etc.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Welll... T'was all a great ball starting with Phil Wheeler's
  personal hospitality for over two days and programming help derived from
  there. Then the really fine group of SIGers at the Santa Monica meeting where
  Tony and I met for the first time and had a fine pow-wow as well as a nifty
  meeting with Eiji, Denny, and many other SIG members.
(Sysop Tony) [Laugh?  I thought he'd never start!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Santa Barbara's Group was most hospitable also and good time
  was spent there. In Seattle on the 19th Mark Eppley was a gracious host.
  Didn't discover any "great" truths there but Mark is well aware of the need
  for continued Traveling Software presence on the SIG. Ken Smith will be here
  on a "regular" basis. Tried to make it clear to Mark that we didn't consider
  once a week as "regular."
(Mike A.) Thanks...Denny show ya the ROM Bank ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, I saw the ROM bank briefly. Sam Redman showed me one in
  October too.


(joshua) I was wondering why all these ads I ve seen lately go gaga over the
 Tandy PDD. Its only 100k, couldn't they do better like the Chipmunk? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I understand precisely what you mean ...
  HOWsomeverwhichway, the TDD is a good product for the price. Methinks that,
  unfortunately, too many folks don't know what they are NOT getting. Similar
  to the Tandy 200. Still run into RSCC folks that think adding RAM to the 200
  gives you 128K of contiguous RAM.
(Mike A.) (snicker!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The TDD is misrepresented by salesmen that should stick to
  battery sales.
(Sysop Tony) (Like that quote, Dave)
(joshua) y're talking to a T200 owner(smile when you say that)
 but I realize that 2ndary storage fages fills up real quickly. 
(DaveW.) [Buyer, beware.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tickled pink to meet and support understanding 200 owners.
  However, FACTS do not have to be apoligized for .....
  Just the facts, ma'am ....
  Facts mean you never have to say you're sorry ....
  never nudge nonsense near knowledge ....
(LARRY L) AARRGGHH!!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Larry? Plan to be in Princeton for the PCMfest in October!!
(LARRY L) Dave..you talkin to me?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes Larry, was speaking to you about the Pcmfest in Princeton
  come October. Watch for news. I'll be there again.


(PhilW) now that I have the Chipmunk I';ve decided to look into FORTH.
 Looks like we a ve a Forther or two here.  What are it's pros and cons?
 Why should I learn it as another language?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gollee phil, suggest that you query Mike Weiblen and
  Tim Ekdom; they are the big forthrighters around here.
(PhilW) is anyone in here now who is into FORTH? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John R?? Are you a FORTH writer??
(PhilW) [deafening silence!]
(John R) Nope. The major advantage of FORTH is that programs are transportable
 among many different machines. Otherwise, I would stick to BASIC for programs
 which are for just the Model 100.


(RICH L) Does anyone here know if the new dos from ULTRA SOFT has the same
 saveall feature as TS-DOS?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony, any word about that Disk Power over the last few weeks??
(Sysop Tony) No additional information has been forthcoming. They have their
 own BBS for support, and there was one message to the effect it's integrated
 with Hugo's TEXT POWER.


(Mike W) wondering if anyone liked and/or read my article in the April
 Portable 100/200/600 about the notebook power supply? Comments?
(Sysop Tony) There was one SIG member at the LAUGH-IN who expressed a liking
 for it, and was going to build it, but he decided on a notebook with a zipper.
 That's all.
(RICH L) Yesterday at our 100 meeting, there where 2 people that had them
 and a few more are going to make them.  It was a well written article...and
 thank you very much.
(Mike W) thanks its rewarding to know that at least someone read the thing.
 i have to go now, ^Dave^, so see you later.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, keep in mind that folks don't say much if it works.
  Programs here are heard about only if they bomb. I've one program downloaded
  over 1,000 times and nary a word.
(Mike W) Thanks for the kind words; no news is good news, i guess.


(George V.W.) Speaking of bombing, I've been having some trouble with ASM.BA
 from DL 4 while trying to assemble a routine (about 1FA long) that ORGs at
 E000,  I keep getting an uncoverable error in basic program message. 
 According to the mem map that I downloaded from DL 4, it shouldn't be
 interfering with anything, though.  any ideas?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) do you have the entire System Map of seven files, over 90K,
  or just the short one?
(George V.W.) dave.. yes I have 100ram rdc and 100rom rc0-6.
 tony clued me in to their existence. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, just czeching ....
(DaveW.) Did you clear the space out with the clear command first or does
 the program do it on its own?
(George V.W.) Dave.. not sure.  I thought that ASM cleared the space itself
 but I could be wrong.
(DaveW.) If the program doesn't issue the CLEAR command you could be
 overwritting BASICs scratch-pad memory area.
(George V.W.) My problem is that ASM crashes before it completes Pass 1
 of the assembly.  I haven't even been able to get it to give me a debugged
 listing.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) assembley is not my bag at all. While Dave was helping, I dug
  frantically through my not yet unpacked stuff for a report on our assemblers
  prepared for me by one of the SIG members in Los Angeles. Just found same and
  the program you are using passed his testing just fine. ASM.BA?? right?
  and I assume you have the ASM.DOC that pertains.
(George V.W.) yes, that's the program.  I have the doc and the LDASM program
 that goes with it.  I downloaded Xmodem, so there shouldn't be any
 transmission errors.  I've tried assembling from tape just in case
 there wasn't enough available RAM for all the assoc. files, but I still get
 that (^%#%^%&( UNRCOVERABLE ERROR in BASIC msg.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Suggestion George: Prepare a message offline detailing the
  problems and leave it on the message board to All 72176,2507
  That will get it to author if still around and also to the many helpers
  around here.
(John R) The only other thing that I would suggest is to try to assemble
 pieces of your program separately. It is possible that either your program
 is overflowing memory when assembling or some syntax error in it is causing
 the assembler to go crazy.
(George V.W.) well, the assembler is supposed to provide an OV err msg,
 but that may be the trouble.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hu nax??
  Mortimer made magic merrily in Maryland.
(Thom) (no Chinese food today, please)
(Sysop Tony) And bombed udderly in Wisconsin.
(John R) [The Timonium Tee-heers take turns talking]
(Sysop Tony) (Good one, John!)


(Rob D) For Mike Anders: Has Stanford come up with anything on fixing
 the problem of the DR specification table moving around in Lucid Data when
 deleting rows?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good question, but Mike Anders has gawn!!
(Rob D) Anybody else know?
 [defening silence]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Best ask if my enchiladas are hot; I'm not Lucid.
(DaveW.) [Not a Lucidite.]
(Sysop Tony) (That's Troglodite!)
(Rob D) ok thanks..will send a message to Mike A. later. .


(Rob D) I just jumped into co.... is there really a Model 102 as recently
 rumored oon this SIG?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, but t'ain't a FANTASTIC difference I'm told. Slimmer with
  better port arrangements and, supposedly, fewer bugs.
(DaveW.) [Cheaper version of M100 so Tandy can make more money on it.]
(Rob D) No exta ROM Slots I presume?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not to my knowledge but I haven't seen one as yet.
(Dana H.) When is this 102 due out?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) best as I can understand they want to sell out the current
  Model 100 inventory at $399 before the Model 102 is brought out for $499
  in (About July)
(Sysop Tony) Dana... There has not yet been an official announcement that the
 M102 exists.  However, it is available in some stores, today.  If you really
 want one fast, try some of the mail order dealers.
(Gary D.) Is 102 peek/poke compatible with 100 programs?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gary, THAT won't be fully known until we get them in our hands
  and start REALly testing ...
(Sysop Tony) Gary... That's not yet been verified But it is said to be
 "software compatible.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) but, as Tony said, they are SUPPOSED to be software compatible   but not hardware compatible. According to my ears.
(Gary D.) Many thanks...yet another chang_(to keep us interested! 


(DaveW.) Wouldn't it be interesting if you could get a list of the ID#s that
 have accessed particular files in the DLs?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "Nice" mebbe but hardly worth the expenditure in disk space
  et cetera. Why Dave?? 
(DaveW.) True, but it would be nice to know sometimes who have grabbed your
 goodies then you could go back and ask them how its going.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm humm, and also t'would make a fine mailing list for
  various nefarious (and unnefarious) uses.
(Gerald L) To add to DaveW comments it might me helpful who had a certain
 dl program since it would provide the members with selfhelp.,  The board would
 do fine too, I suppouse.




(Gerald L) Does the m102 have at least 32k ram if expansion is not possible?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gerald. Iteration; we know little. Probably be just like the
  100 with 29K max available.
(Sysop Tony) It will be sold as 24K for $495 and an 8K addition is $15.
 Since the buss comes out the back, No RAM expansion internal, in the
 machine doubt many folks want something hanging out the back.
(Gerald L) fifteen dollars extra?
(DaveW.) [$15 for 8K?]
(Sysop Tony) Yes, fifteen dollars!!!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Quite a change from my $999 Mortimer expanded to 32K for $149


(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is it for the day ...
  Glad to be back ...
  Thanks for coming ...
  All go to yak-yak mode ....
  Stay and enjoy ...
  End of conference.
