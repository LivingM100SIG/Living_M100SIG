(larry l) I saw your pic and a write-up of you in ONLINE. pretty ritzy.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup, nicely done article methinks. thank eeeee.

11:01:31 AM EDT Sunday, October 5, 1986

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Phil, what's been new in the past two weeks?
  Is POWR-DOS the main news??
(PhilW) Yes, I think Powr-DOS (aka P-DOS) is it. Plus I now have the new menu
 utility from PG Designs for the 224K RAM. And it is very good; seems to have
 fixed all the bugs reported in RAMPG1.TIP (DL4).
(Mel) Any news re a Model 200 Powr-DOS...and how many bytes for the M100?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Phil? Does the flyer mention the 200? Bytes?
(PhilW) flyer is not here in view, but the manual says for the 100 and 200.
 takes 3044 bytes -- and relocates above other low-ram resident stuff.
 appears fully compatible with MENU.BA for the RAM.
(Mel) Is it usable online? Can you save/upload while online?
(PhilW) Haven't tried it.  But there are some words in there about doing that
 but I think you need eithere X-TEL or DIRACC (by Hugo, BTW!) to do that.
 I just left you a message on it, Mell.  Main thing to me is disk recovery.
 for 200 it may be that you can edit BIG files on the disk, by paging in
 peices of them.  
(Mel) Great idea! Thanks. BTW -- the new comment in the DL6 file re Richard
 Eckerlin is pretty strong, don't you think?
(PhilW) [yes, but ....]
 It agrees with info I have gathered
(Mel) It's just this -- Disk Power does all it claims to do and more; the fact
 that the supplier's on-line PR man did or did not follo through on making his
 stuff work with other people's hardware should not necessarily be the subject
 of a pretty personal attack. I think it's a lot more of concern when, like
 PCSG, someone markets a product like the M200 Munk, which does not do half of
 what's advertised.
(PhilW) Constraining my words a bit..
 I think  Richard is more than an on-line rep; I believe he is an officer of
 the company.  And (if so) that makes a fair diff.  Plus much less seems to
 have been done in the past than he reported. But I would have just pulled the
 positive review, or reported the incompatibility.
 I do think that Disk Power 100, unless it learns to relocate and gets some of
 the P-DOS freatures (which TS-RANDOM) will have too (it is said) will fall
 behind.  I wonder why Richard HAS been so silent of late?
(Leonard E.) While I'm not all that familar with this situation, if he
 represents a company and makes promises/statements/etc and doesn't follow up
 on them he *should* be raked over the coals!
(Mel) My point is, -- first, the product should perform as advertised. Then,
 it's open to interpretation. PRODUCTS NOT People should be reviewed on DL6.


(PhilW) I thought i would mention the new menu utility by PG Designs.  It
 appears to work with all but their earliest ram modules, so will be of
 interest to 64K owners; very easy to install, and does not require the removal
 of other BAsic stuff first.  Still must be the lowest, tho.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) May we expect a full review of BIGRAM ere long now?
(PhilW) Yes indeed Think I will leave the P-DOS review to Joel Dinda.


(Leonard E.) what (besides DSKI$/DSKO$) is added to the new dos?
(PhilW) Well, it has the capability to recover files on a trashed disk (VERY
 much similar to Norton Utilities).  CO, BA, DO, CA and it will let you edit a
 BIG file on the disk via a program called D-TEXT.  Seems to work fine.
 It also will plug itself in just above other low-RAM resident stuff such as
 MENU.BA, SUPERA, etc.  very neat!
(Leonard E.) hmmm... wonder if it would work with DVI?
(PhilW) [NOT likely!  Hooks into TDD ROM functions.]
(Leonard E.) Also, what size 'block' does DSKI$/DSKO$ use?
(PhilW) DISKI$ is an info gatherer.  DSKO$ is the I/O function.  Don't
 rightly know, but I will look in manual and report back.
 Joel is playing with that one! 


(Thom Hartmann) <greetings to all from West Germany...
 gotta run as connect is very expensive!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gruss Gott!
(Thom Hartmann) Danke!  Gruss Gott back!


(Terry G.) How does one go about obtaining the new and improved
 PG Design Utility?
(PhilW) No info on upgrades. I'd call them. Phone is 313-727-2744


(Bob S.) has anyone been able to use DCPREP with Power-DOS?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmm, Denny and Tony are the big spelling checker folks
  and neither are here; methinks neither has P-DOS either. Phil? Help?
(PhilW) If it works with Powr-DISK and uses only supported functions, it should
 wrk with P-DOS.  Call MAXRAM must be replaced with Call MAXRAMC every where.
 [spell check with TDD = Sloooowww!]
(Leonard E.) (re: spell checker) does it use the complete word or are they
 packed?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) complete word methinks. Phil? You did part of the dictionary.
(PhilW) Yes, and they were complete words; slow even on the 'Munk. 
(Terry G.) DCPREP is the m/l portion of the spell chkr that strip all dups and
 alpha sorts the doc file selected to be checked. this prgm does conflict with
 TS-DOS and cannot be run with DOS on; after you have sorted the file u must
 then exit to basic and reset maxram, then goto DOS and turn DOS on then load
 spell chkr prgm. to check file in ram against disk based dict.
(PhilW) P-DOS sits very low in RAM; should not conflict with Hi-RAM programs
 unless you are out of memory! 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Whew! That is a real effort!
  Could learn to spell in all that time!!
(Terry G.) The truth 4 sure. That is why I use IBM AT with WordStar 2000+ to
 speel check.


(Leonard E.) I'm *sure*  someone out there already knows this, but there is a
 'simple' packing algorithm that can give enormous space savings. It only works
 on sorted text though. Anybody interested in details?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sounds like sump'n to put up in a help file for the spelling
 checker project.
(Bob S.) I'd like to hear more on this packer
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Lets hear about the packing albloodyithm??
(Leonard E.) easy to state harder to do. First word is complete. all following
 words start with a char (128+# of chars for which they are identical to
 previous word. thus "the" "then" "there" would be "the" "<128+3>n" "<128+3>re"
 etc. (first heard of it as a trick for the PC1 or 2.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, Bob? Follow up question?
(Bob S.) No, but is this a working program or just an idea at this point.
 If it works, would Leonard load it into the DL 
(Leonard E.) I've never used it, but it was a working prog on that
 *pocket computer*!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) When you have all the D/VI programs written, then you can
  write the spelling helper program Leonard.
(Leonard E.) <riiiiggghhhttt>


(TOM BUCKLEY) WHAT HAPPENED TO portable 100 mag?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ho hum. Darned if we know for sure; the magazine has appeared
  on some bookstore stands, but hasn't been received by members on subscription
  for some months. I'm not wasting money on getting lame excuses and empty
  promises by telephoning them for an explanation any longer.
(PhilW) Just got a letter saying that WAyne Green has sold PICO to Terry
 Keppner.
(Leonard E.) well, for what it is worth, P100 & Byte appeared on stands at the
 same time. My copy of BYTE arrived on Thursday.
(PhilW) [different months, I'll bet!]
(\/\/ayne) Phil - interesting note, that about Terry. He had mentioned he was
 on the down-and-outs with Cliff Campbell, who bought the Kepner Letter from
 him... and was looking for a project to do.  Hope Terry has good luck with it,
 though he didn't mention anything about it a couple of weeks ago when we
 talked.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Wayne, last week there was the thought expressed of getting
  Traveling here to talk about RANDOM-DOS but only AFTER folks have used it a
  bit to be able to question and comment. Likewise, Acroatix with their gnu
  Powr-DOS. Now it seems that Acroatix has beat Traveling to the delivery
  and with GOOD GOODS !!! Methinks me call'm both for CO's in November.
(\/\/ayne) Sounds good from this end... actually, as long as the program is
 either ready or just about ready to go, I've got no problem with a "pre-buy"
 conference, too. But you're right, they'd be naturals for a get together.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, will do but separately one on one week, t'other two
  weeks later.
(PhilW) [Comon Dave; doncha like blood sports on Sunday?]


(TOM BUCKLEY) Is Flpy.CO compatible with Scripsit100?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oh me. Methinks that you make it so with use of FLIPML program
  from DL 4 for which you see FLIPML.DOC. keep in mind that the program
  CORTNS.CO is the one in Scripsit that needs being adjusted to.
  Am I correct Phil?
(PhilW) Completely so, Dave.
 But. Since CORTNS.CO is loaded by S-SIT, FLIPML may not do the job. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm. Possible. Tom, methinks your best bet is to unload
  FLOPPY prior to use of SS and vice versa. Perhaps DSKMGR from DL 5 would be
  better idea or does that use FLOPPY too?
(PhilW) Yes, DSKMGR might be better due to the fact that it will remove itself
 after running.  With M/L programs, compatibility is usually an issue only if
 you want to run one to work with another. e.g., access Powr-DOS or some such
 from another m/l program. If you can run one, unload it and run another,
 no problem.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Tom? Czech out DSKMGR.DOC as a better operating system
  for your TDD.


(Terry G.) Did you say that Traveling Software is coming out with a new DOS?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, RANDOM-DOS is due.
(PhilW) [TS-RANDOM]
(Terry G.) Any new and exciting revisions you care to share?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Know nutt'n!!
(PhilW) It is said to have true random access, allow up to 8 files open on disk
 at once, let you use differrent sector sizes (needed for random access,
 maybe), recover lost files, etc.
(Steve Z) I'm trying to find out if it'll work with T-0Base; as of Thursday,
 product "expected any time " but not in for shipment.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) So far nobody has it as far as I know, but lets hear from
  Rush who is on Traveling's doorstep.
(R Caley) I beta-tested it, but then it is more of a programmers tool than an
 application software for guys like me.
(PhilW) I think its  a T-BASE issue.  T-B needs to be able to hook into
 non-?RAM files. Now you can only select RAM files (Ultimate ROM II version;
 maybe alone version is different). 


(Steve Z) RE ZPCHAR - I've successfully downloaded WRD001.WRD and used it,
 so I thought it'd work OK - only problem so far has been .PLN files, which
 won't transfer other than in SYLK (ascii) format.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mortie 600 is having great puzzlementalcations over that file.
  He's downloaded it six times and been unable to access it; the screen
  freezes, have to press RESET, and then the file is gone. We'll keep on
  experimenting though. Want to download to disk.
(Steve Z) That's EX-Actlly what happened when I downloaded the .PLN files to
 the ZP! I had to get them in .SYK format!  Hopefully, the .TXT version is
 loadable - if so, feel free to re-upload it as a .WRD file ifn you want!
 (WOW - another incompatibility discovered!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Steve, the .TXT file isn't print formatted at all. It appears
  that way on my Tandy 1000 anyway.
  Did you "PRINT" to .txt with no formatting? or formatted?
(Steve Z) I did it w/o formatting - but would be happy to do it
 formatted and re-upl!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Do that, and then I'll see what happens in WORD.


(R Caley) I missed the big DV/I discussion last week. But you guys sure left
 out alot of good stuff available.
(Leonard E.) such as *what*? You have my curiousity aroused, sir!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rush, Leonard specifically was looking for feedback from that
  conference and left messages on the board. Help him!!
(R Caley) haven't you heard about the Disk Buddy system??? It revolutionizes
 DVI use!!
(Leonard E.) As far as I could tell from ads (which I haven't seen in a
 while!) It is a glorified menu system. I'm more interested in the equiv of NU,
 or Super Utility or SuperZap. A Word star clone would be nice too.
(R Caley) there's a there is aLOT more than menus
(Sysop .^Dave^.) WHAT does Disk Buddy do that is better than Menu; what
  utilities?
(R Caley) You don't have to get locked into all the syntax of
 typing 0: blah blah all the time. There is all kinds of function key
 utilities for copy to any device, load, save, append..name disk, also you can
 do boolean searches on datafiles. it goes on and on...I love it!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No monitor or file recovery utilities?
(R Caley) No, there are no file recovery utilities, but then my disks never
 crash for some reason.
(Leonard E.) Mine quit crashing after I quit using the utlities for disabling
 Disk Basic (to allow using the 100 without the DVI attached). I've had a
 couple lately most likely vaused by running out of room with multiplan.
(Dana) How about a utility to remove those 4697 DVi bytes?
(R Caley) there is also a super new DISqq
 there IS one for that purpose in DL5 under DVI/CAt. It works great, but you
 have to get used to it first.
 You do NOT have to cold start m-100 to use the DVI!
(Sysop .^Dave^.)  Dana, see DVI.CAT. That's in DL 5.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay!! ...
  CO closing time. Mucho mercis to all.
  See you when ....
  ta ta.
