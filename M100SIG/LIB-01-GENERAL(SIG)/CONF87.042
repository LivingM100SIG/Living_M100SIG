(Jeff) One question, is there a way to DL a file that is the maximum memory of
  my computer and change it to BAsic?

(Sysop Denny) Well, this is close enough  Jeff, yes  but you need some kind of
  device to store...

(Jeff) Could you expain?  Will a cassette do?

(Sysop Denny) a cassette will work just fine.

(Jeff) How do I save it?

(Sysop Denny) Go into basic and type SAVE "CAS:filename"  that should do it.
  oops go into text and save the DO file  to cassette...

(Jeff) Thanks Denny

(Sysop Denny) and then bring it back by going into basic and typing
  LOAD"CAS:Filename"

(Larry L) Denny, are you using Tony's MACRO program? and if so which
  version?

(Sysop Denny) Larry, I'm using his most current version...

(Larry L) [which hardware?]

(Sysop Denny) the one that works in basic.  For the M100.

(Larry L) so how do you like it..any conflicts?

(Sysop Denny) Well  I don't like the fact that I can't use the Chipmunk with
  it but other than that, there haven't been any problems.

(Larry L) thanks..

(Phil W) Well  Actually there are a few. For me the biggest is that I cannot
  use it on line when using X-TEL.  Issue is that all the F-keys are taken
  by XTEL., so there is not a good way to get into the macro progream  But
  Denny assures me he is near a solutiion (grin!)

(Sysop Denny) Yes,  We have been throwing around a few ideas  on how to
  interface this program to others. If done, would make it a lot more
  powerful any more Larry?

(Larry L) no thanks..I'm thinking of trying the  basic M100 ver.  I have the
  PCSG ram  and was wondering if there were any known  problems.

(Sysop Denny) Well, Phil has the PG ram
  and has tried it, not the same but similar.

(Phil W) Very different issue  I'm afraid. the PG 0menu program lives in low
  ram like the macro program so Tony has a special version to take care of
  that.  I doubt if a  special version of the pgm is needed to work with the
  PCSG ram, but I don't know for certain that anyone has tried it. Anyone?
  Denny?

(STUART R.) hi-i just bought a tdd1 from la jolla computer for $100  and i get
  a "hard disk failure" message more often than not is this normal ?

(Sysop Denny) No, that isn't normal  Sometimes, it could be the connection  to
  the computer, but this sounds more serious than that Have you talked to the
  store about it?

(STUART R.) No, not ...I guess thats my next logical step...maybe I can talk
  them into giving me a tdd2 exchange

(Phil W) [or another TDD-1]

(Sysop Denny) I would go to the store and try out another one  preferably a
  TDD1, since there are some advantages to owning one.

(STUART R.) I only work with this store by mail, so I don't get to La Jolla
  often, but his prices are usually 30% off normal RS list. I think he goes
  through a lot of 102's a month..thnks

(Sysop Denny) Ok, well you could go to a RS store and try one out there

(Phil W) Can't diagnose over the phone too well  but there have been a few
  reports like yours, and almost all were cleared up buy getting a
  replacement of course, now replacements are less available, and  you may
  have to "settle" for a TDD-2 (if you gan get him to work that deal).

(R Caley) OK  a few short comments  1. About tony's program  I am very
  interested in the portion he is working on that allows it  to work in
  TEXT!! This will allow a function somewhat  like "LIBRARY" in Write Rom  is
  Tony done with that part? 2. New magazines  I enjoyed my copy of Laptop
  User and wish JD all the best  3. TDD drive  Which Operating system thinks
  there could be a hard disk??? M-100 or TDD?  4.  Vocabulary  I have been
  using the word "MAVEN" all week long and no one seems to know  what it means
  either.. guess I'm in good company.

(Sysop Denny) (grin) You must not be in New York.

(Larry L) OK  About Maven...It is a Yiddish from the  Hebrew word "Mayveen"
  which means "to know".  Maven refers to a person who thinks he knows
  everything.

(Phil W) Well, I was going to say that Tony is  a "macro maven" but I doubt if
  he  would clainm to know all!  Re the disk question (#3)  what was the bit
  about a hard disk suppose to mean.

(R Caley) ok  the gentleman with the TDD said he got an error  that said "Hard
  disk error"

(Sysop Denny) Ah, That would be from the TDD.

(Phil W) "hard trouble" I think! Bad news from TDD land!

(R Caley) one more question  will the program in Laptop user  that allowed you
  to read backward one screen like in TELCOM  work in TEXT?

(Sysop Denny) Doesn't seem like you'd need to  since you can scroll back line
  by line
  in TEXT, but I imagine it could work there also  knowing David Sumner.

(R Caley) ok  I don't like going line by line.

(Phil W) Well, from the article it works only in Basic.  But in text you can do
  SHIFT  with up arrow to get the same effect, can you not?

(R Caley) you're right, i think.

(Dave S.) well  I have some comments about a deep subject: "multitasking on
  the M100:  If no one minds me rambling on about a story that might get deep 
  then let me continue  else I'll
  yield...

(Phil W) [tease!]

(Sysop Denny) No, you have the floor, Dave.  ga

(Dave S.) ok  several months ago while i was  exploring the "inards" of my
  M100 I learned about the interupt the  CPU uses to scan the keyboard  and
  the vector in ram which allows other things to do stuff  every 4mS also
  mmmm...this smacked at an idea for allowing "background" processes  to work
  while I do other things (BASIC,TEXT,etc) [keeping up with me so far?]
  I wrote a program to print files  in background  ---it worked fine
  EXCEPT that everytime I did something  which moved files around in RAM  the
  pointers to the file printing would temporarily get messed up
  until my process ...fixed itself....

(R Caley) Will this work better if  you printed files from an external device?

(Dave S.) well, my initial reasons were to print RAM files and experiment with 
  backgound for context switching  for real background processing [alittle
  more and I'll yield for comments]...

  Conclusions: 1.  the operating system  of the M100 doesn't provide
  semaphores for resource sharing (RS, I'm sure,  didn't intend on
  multitasking when designing the M100)...

(R Caley) [realllly??]

(Dave S.) that is why I had problems with file  pointers  2.  For real
  multitasking, the stack pointer must be a readable(savable) item  but the
  8085 has a "write only" stack pointer. well, I just burnt out on this so 
  I'll let you "gurus" comment.

(Sysop Denny) ok, Dave, You should look at the book Inside the M100...

(Dave S.) [I have]

(Sysop Denny) for a discussion about the BA port that warns of dire
  problems if it isn't managed properly  That's probably what you are running
  into, don't you think?

(Dave S.) well  what I need is for the OS  to raise a flag saying  "ok, I'm
  moving files and stuff everybody else: hands off for awile"

(Sysop Denny) Quite a topic, perhaps a message to the masses might be in
  order Also, guys like David Sumner would have some insight in this  Any more
  comments?

(Dave S.) No more comments, maybe  someday when I pursue this problem
  again, I'll leave a message to the masses...thanks.

(Gerald G) A comparison question on the m100 and 102  Does the 102 have a
  "built in" spread sheet or grpahics program?

(Sysop Denny) No, It has exactly the same programs as the M100  it just looks
  different and has a differnt font of charaters and a few patches that are
  different.

(Gerald G) Wishful thinking on my part. I was hoping for new features. Thank
  you.

(Phil W) The M100 and 102 have  very differnt system bus interface, both
  physically and electrically so that such things as the Chipmunk and the PG
  Designs RAM bank and the PCSG bank will not work with the 102.  HOWEVER --
  there are a new series of devices being marketed with will work with the
  102 but not with the 100.

(David K.) Has anybody heard something on the quest for disk info on the DVI
  concerning sector read/write in M-Code. What are the hardware interface
  differences?

(Sysop Denny) Not to my knowledge.

(Gerald G) It appears that when someone now buys a third party product he (or
  she) might not know which computer the product is compatible with.

(Phil W) [caveat emptor!]

(Sysop Denny) Yes, that IS a problem.

(Gerald G) That is not an encouraging marketing policy Phil.

(Phil W) Well, in fact  the ads I've seen are very explicit, so that reading
  (generally needed to use computers!) provides the needed info  but often we
  do not read as well as we should.  I don't know what more a vendor can do,
  Before buying any product of this type, we should call the vendor, make sure
  it will work in the intended computor, and (mainly!) make sure he is
  really delivering.  Big issue is that ads appear long before product in
  some cases (SuperROM was 4 months!) and some products never materialize
  like the "C" for the M100 that some folks actually paid for!

(grant) good idea Phil. I usually wait for the Price to go down anyway.

(David K.) Thank you.  First, if I may  add that I am testing a new routine
  for the DVI that does a "split-screen" conference mode  with output to the
  monitor -- input on the Lcd. Second -- can anybody tell me how to access the
  darn disk through machine lan.

(Sysop Denny) Excellent! I've been toying with that idea for sometime now  but
  have not put it into the schedule Our resident "maven" on DVI is Leonard
  Ericksen...

(Phil W) [and Martin Zimmerman]

(Sysop Denny) but I don't have one, I can't be of much help.

(David K.) Tsk.  I'll keep looking for it on the DL.  I'd like to use it with
  Fig-Forth.

(Sysop Denny) Ok

(Phil W) Just a short notice: To the programs which handle transfers with the
  PC has been added TRANSF.ARC in DL3 (download into the PC).  It is a very
  nice one.  supports word processor format changes (wordstar and wordperfect)
  and is very user friendly.  If you are using either FLTIBM or PCXFER, you
  should give this new one a try

(Sysop Denny) Speaking of notices, has anyone read the one from PG Design
  about the "Vault"?

(Phil W) Yupp!  no price, tho!

(Sysop Denny) That could induce you to get a 102, Phil (grin)

(Rob L.) Any 600 owners..by any chance.

(Sysop Denny) Well, I don't know if we have any here.  anyone?

(Rob L.) ahh ga.  I have a problem. Can you answer one question?
  I log on to compuserve with the settings  7 bits and even parity
  with that I can not d/load xmodem 8 bit but when I change my settings on
  telcom to 8n1 I only get garbage as I connect to cis, but not when I call  a
  local bbs..understand?

(Sysop Denny) Yes,  You have to set your parity in GO DEFAULT to 0
  That should get rid of the problem

(Phil W) Rob... I believe you can capture in the 600 without using xmodem
  if so go to dl11 and capture (Read) TEL004.600 (first)  it will give
  the basic info. Also capture the CAT files, one on TELCOM first.  Files
  there should give you all the basic info on using the 600 here.  Problem is
  that it has quite a few features but keep it simple at first, and you will
  find it pretty easy in time also when you do log on at 0 parity (which will
  force 8 bits) expect to see graphics stuff until it says "Password:"  that
  is normal!

(Rob L.) thanxs everyone. I will keep you posted. have a nice day.

(Sysop Denny) Oh, Phil on the Vault...  It fits on the bottom as the bubble
  memory does.

(Phil W) thot so, but what added depth?

(Sysop Denny) Probably makes it the same size as an M100 (grin)  Well, here's
  one from Van Nuys yep, looks good... 

(Phil W) For information, the Vault for the 102 is advertized in the first
  issue of Laptop User.  Gives a large contiguouus RAM bank.  But says
  "call" no price data.

(Sysop Denny) Yes, I don't even want to think what a meg of ram would cost

(Bill H.)  is the vault like the node ??

(Phil W) cost may depend on new duties!

(Sysop Denny) Bill, Probably, but it fits  underneath the 102 and also adds
  slots for M100 type ROMs as well as 102 types.

(Bill H.) ahh..  bigger and better probably

(Phil W) NODE makes the Datapack; PG Designs makes(?) the Vault.  Concepts
  similar. Vault sounds more powerful.  But not in use yet, to my knowledge  If
  I had a 102 I would sure call PG Designs; I'm very pleased with their
  products!

(Bill H.) thats all I had but  I have a NODE and its super for my use

(Dave S.) I kind of lost sync,  what are you guys talking about  vault?
  NODE?...etc..

(Sysop Denny) A new product for the T102 is the Vault  by PG Designs and
  another Ram expansion is the NODE Datapack  Does that clarify?

(Dave S.) ok

(Phil W) Bill,  if you are using a NODE product with the 102, might be a good
  idea to upload a review file to dl 13.  Have not seen much on the board re
  Node and the 102, just stuff on the 200 product.  Be nice to know how it is
  used, what software works with it, etc.  May be a file that showed up while
  I was absent -- is there Denny? Yoo-Hoo

(Sysop Denny) Not that I'm aware of, but I would have to check the index

(Sysop Denny) Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.
