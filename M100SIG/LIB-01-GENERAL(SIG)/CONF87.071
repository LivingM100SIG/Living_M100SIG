(R Caley) [MORNIN']

(Sysop Tony) Good morning Rush.

(R Caley) are we the only one's here?

(Sysop Tony) So far.

(R Caley) You do any fireworks yesterday?

(Sysop Tony) No, fireworks are illegal in the county where I live.

(R Caley) Same here, but that doesn't stop us!

(Sysop Tony) (grin) I hear you.  But then, it doesn't seem that big a deal
  when you're over 50.

(R Caley) Well, it has been quite a tradition with our family  and I'm 40, but
  we have about 50 kids out on the beach all very well supervised  We have not
  had any accidents or anyone hurt since the 1940's!!! that's a pretty good
  record...ga

(Sysop Tony) Well, I would think it's an important activity for the kids  but
  it looses it's value after the kids leave home, and you're by yourself. Any
  more on that, or shall we move on to Edmund's question?

(R Caley) ga edmund

(edmund creekmore) Does anyone know if it is possible to emulateDoes anyone kDoes anyoq

(Sysop Tony) Edmund... ignore what other people type, it's not necessary to
  start over each time you're interrupted. go ahead Edmund with your question.

(edmund creekmore) Does anyone know if it is possible to emulate the m100
  terminal from an IBM PC using something approximating the CTTY command
  on the PCjr?

(Sysop Tony) Maybe Phil does. ....  Phil?

(Phil) yes  I'm here -- sort of; catastrphe with the coffee pot.
  No I cannnot come up with an answer to that question  There
  is PC software which makes it work something like a Model 100 (TeleComuter,
  and Tandy DeskMate are two) but that was not what you mean, I suspect.

(edmund creekmore) I am not looking for a m100 program that emulates the IBM
  PC but rather the other way around.

(Sysop Tony) Well, The Model 100 is generally operating in a dumb terminal
  mode except that it's really an intelligent terminal. what sort of M100
  emulation do you need, and why?

(Phil) Telecomuter and Deskmate ARE PC programs which have features
  such as Text and TElcom which emulate the M100.

(Sysop Tony) go ahead, edmund.  When I type "ga", I am through, and expect
  you to reply.  ga

(edmund creekmore) I have my m100 with DVI set up at work.  Would like to be
  able to access DVI from PCj at home to transfer files for work at home.

(Phil) You are not likely to succed.  But to do so you would  need a BBS type
  system on the M100.  Go to DL3 and do BRO/KEY=BBS and read BBS.THD there.

(Sysop Tony) That's a start.  But I'm not sure that BBS software will allow
  you to access and transfer disk files, ...

(Phil) AGREE!!

(Sysop Tony) and the Model 100 certainly won't be able to  "wake up and
  answer" the phone when you call unless you build a phone line ring
  detector or use an external modem.  You will have to find software for the
  PCJr that offers an intelligent Telecommunications program
  and develop whatever software links are needed to do exactly what you want.

(Phil) There is probably PCjr software  to go the othere way.  But the Model
  100 is a bit small in basic memory and other attributes for what you want
  (with file transfers) some of the BBS stuff in DL3 will be a start.  But
  doing it with the added burden of having the DVI OS installed in high RAM
  willl make it a real programming challenge. (at least).

(Sysop Tony) You might also find some useful information in the file
  REMOTE.USE in DL3. It's an old file, but is generic in nature.

(edmund creekmore) Thanks for your assistance.  Will look into suggestions.

(Sysop Tony) OK... are you finished?

(edmund creekmore) yes

(Sysop Tony) OK... it's customary to type "ga" when you're finished, so we'll
  know.  Thanks.  ga Larry

(Larry R.) I've gotten  comments from local sysops about CR and LF when using
  the M100's upload (F3 key).  Apparently, we use CHR$(13) by itself for both
  CR and LF, while Itty Bitty Machines (IBM) use CHR$(13) for CR and CHR$(10)
  for LF Is there any way to fake that on a Model 100 when uploading to an
  IBM-based BBS??? 

(Sysop Tony) Well, not exactly accurate. ....but close.  When you create a
  text file, and press the ENTER key, both a CR and a LF are stored in the
  file.  That's CHR$(13) and CHR$(10). Since they are both non-printing
  characters, when text is displayed on the screen, they are represented by
  CHR$(143), the left-pointing arrow. When TELCOM uploads the file, it
  normally sends only the CR.   That's the way the ROM is set up for default
  condition.  If you want to also send the LF, all you have to do
  is to go into BASIC  and type POKE 63066,1.  To reverse the
  process type POKE 63066,0. ..... Does that answer your question?

(Larry R.) Does this have any "side effects" that I may need to know????

(Sysop Tony) (Note that the above poke is specific to the Model 100 and 102)
  No... the poke is a "Send LF after CR" flag.  No side effects.

(Larry R.) Well, when I define a linelength in TELCOM F3, (Width:)
  will it also install the LF there??  that is not a place marked
  by the enter key upon creation of the file, but a place where telcom breaks
  the line?

(Sysop Tony) A LF is not sent at all, unless you turn on the flag.  But if the
  flag is "on", any time a CR is sent, a LF will also be sent, no matter how
  the CR gets there.  i.e. whether you put it there or whether the OS puts it
  there.

(Larry R.) Thank you, that covers it.

(Sysop Tony) OK... Robert, you're next, so ga Robert

(Robert) My question deals with the xmodem 26 program in dl3  I downloaded it
  the other night and tried to run it to see how well it worked,  but I kept
  getting stuck on line 68 of the program with the screen blank except for a
  "Find" statement. Any ideas anyone?

(Sysop Tony) Just yesterday, I located a bug in that program  and messaged the
  author; but it didn't have anything to do with your problem.
  The "Find" prompt is expecting you to input  what name in your ADRS.DO file
  you want the program to look up.  did the program fail to look up a name?
  did you have an ADRS.DO file in RAM?

(Robert) yes I do have an adrs.do file with a few numbers in it.  the program
  didn't do anything after it found the number it was looking for, though

(Sysop Tony) Oh, well, you didn't follow through. ...
  Once the name and phone number are found  and displayed on the screen, you
  have some options if you press the ENTER key, the program will look for
  another entry, or if you press any other key  the program will dial the
  number displayed.  Did you get that far?  (the above turned out to be
  incorrect - ed.)

(Robert) no. I tried to get it to dial the number,
  but with no luck  it seems as if it just got "stuck at that spot.

(Sysop Tony) Well, just press the space bar, and the program will dial.  If it
  doesn't, then something else is wrong.  However I have the program running
  on both the 100 and 200 without problem.  So there isn't a problem with the
  program.

(Larry R.) OK  I have Rick Perry's XMODEM  and on it, you have to press a
  specific key for what kind of modem you have.  To use the built-in modem,
  press the m key, etc.  BTW, Tony,  Did the bug  you found have anything to
  do with the auto log on when there isn't one in the  particular listing in
  ADRS???

(Sysop Tony) Larry may be right.  I don't have the program listing right at my
  fingertips. It may be that you have  to press a specific key to signal what
  you want the program to do.  As I recall, the older versions of the
  program it was M for internal modem, 3 or 5 for  an external modem at 300 or
  1200 baud.  I'd have to check the code to be sure.  You should find that
  around line 68 or 69 in the program.  in the form of an INSTR command, if
  you want to look. 

(Larry R.) When I first  got the thing, I pressed C (for Call, which works on
  straight TELCOM) and got no results, until I found out that I had to press
  M.  Again, I am curious as to what the bug (son of a glitch) you found was
  I am having trouble with BBS's for which I don't have an auto logon entered.

(Sysop Tony) But you're using a different program, Larry.  You mentioned Rick
  Perry's XMODEM.312 While Robert is having a problem with XMDM26.100.
  While your experience with XMODEM may be similar, it could also be quite
  different.  Leonard had made considerable changes in XMDM26.  As for the
  bug, it appears in line 39 of XMDM26.100 a jump to a non-existant line 41.
  Not likely to be found unless you try to append to an existing file.

(Larry R.) OK

(Robert) the version that I downloaded the other night  was the Xmodem26.100
  by Rick Perry but modified by I think Leonard with another  program that I
  had to merge with Xmodem to get the whole thing to work...

(Sysop Tony) Well, let's clarify that for a moment  The original XMODEM
  program for the Model 100 was written by Rick Perry but there have been
  several adaptations of the program that were not written by Rick, but which
  are based on his original program.  XMDM26 is an adaptation, done by Leonard
  erickson with quite a few changes.  If you merged it with another program,
   that's probably the source of your problem, since it was not meant
  to be merged with anything else, but is a whole new program  capable of
  operating on it's own.

(Robert) I'm going to go to dl3 right now to find the exact one I downloaded
  to be able to give you better info.

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Let us know.

(Larry R.) In a  nutshell, what are the "improvements" Leonard made on the
  XMODEM program?   I really would not want to start learning something
  radically different unless it had serious upgrades that would benefit me.

(Sysop Tony) Well, he redesigned the program so that it works with an external
  Hayes compatible modem, and supports 300, 1200 and 2400 baud.  It also works
  with the internal modem at 300 baud.  He has also documented the program in
  3 files including a commented listing of the program that tells what each
  line does.  Something that wasn't available before.  The original Xmodem
  program was so convoluted, it was almost impossible to modify.  With
  Leonard's version, it is very easy to modify for specific applications.
  I've got several versions working myself, with differnt modifications
  installed. One of them is doing the transcript right now, from Channel 20.

(Larry R.) So  if I have only the internal modem, the only advantage would be
  the increased doc's available which might allow me to cut  some of the fat
  out of my working copy...like the lines which refer to the other modems and
  baud speeds, etc.   Am I correct?  Or did I miss something?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that would be one thi}ing you could do.  You can also set it
  up for a default number which would be dialed if the program can't find an
  ADRS.DO file or if it can't find the name you indicate in the file.  Or it
  can look for an ADRS.DO file on disk, instead of in RAM.

(Larry R.) I have a TDD2, so I don't think it could access my disk, and I use
  a BBS.DO file, but I understand what you're saying.

(Sysop Tony) Note that those mods aren't in the program already, but can be
  added, if those are the mods you want or need.  If you have one of the
  alternate DOS's for the TDD-2... Ooops.... nope, that won't work.  my mouth
  ran off before my brain caught up. ...

(Larry R.) Good thing you caught it.

(Sysop Tony) you can't access the ADRS.DO file on a TDD disk ...

(Phil) [why not?]

(Sysop Tony) while using the internal modem.  But wait a minute! ...

(Phil) [Good point!]

(Sysop Tony) Phil is right.  You haven't yet connected to the modem, so you
  COULD  get the phone number from a disk file, given a DOS that can access
  the file.  Gee, I wish they had built the TDD right!

(Larry R.) What alternative DOS would you recommend which would  allow me to
  use disks prepared with the FLOPPY DOS and do these other nifty things????

(Sysop Tony) Last I heard, TS-DOS 3.0 was the only version available for the
  TDD-2. 

(Phil) Well, I think TS-DOS is the only one ready to date, with
  statements from Ultrasoft that DISK }iPOWER will have a version for the
  TDD2.  But TS-DOS 3.0 is in users hands, right now.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, And the old version of Disk Power partially works with the
  TDD-2.  But it only lists 40 files in the disk directory.  Acroatix,
  developers of Power-Disk and Power-DOS have also indicated they were working
  on one, but without a means of advertising the product, aren't working on it
  very hard. 

(Larry R.) I'd like to hear about why there's no means  of advertising a
  product did the new M100 mag go under already  but I'd like to ask for name
  and DL of product review of TS-DOS 3.0

(Sysop Tony) Apparently Laptop User has suspended publication. .... Portable
  100 has not yet restarted publishing.... PCM supports a different market
  and PICO is not well thought of. 

(Larry R.) PICO?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know if we have a review of TS-DOS 3.0, since it's not
  much different that 2.1, except that it handles the TDD-2.  You have to
  remember, our reviews are written by members,  and the TDD-2 is just
  starting in the market.  it may be a while before someone considers 3.0
  significantly different from 2.1, enough so that they will write a review of
  it.  After all, what will they say?  This is exactly the same as the earlier
  version except that it works on the TDD-2?  That's it.  That's the review.

(Larry R.) Got a reviewof 2.1?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, there is a review of 2.1 in DL13.  Try TS-DOS.REV.

(Phil) I wonder how many TDD2's are in use here  and if that is not why we
  don't yet have a review of the new version?

(Sysop Tony) I'm fond of saying that Phil and I got the first two  TDD's
  shipped into the LA area when they were first released.  And, we don't have
  a review of the new version, because no one has written one yet.  Any more
  on this topic, Larry?  Phil?

  [no]

(Robert J. deViolini) I'm back from dl3

(Sysop Tony) OK... what did you find, Robert?

(Robert J. deViolini) The program that I downloaded was dated  5/26/87 by
  Leonard Ericson as a revision to the original Xmodem312  by Rick  The intro
  states that you must download the Xmdm26.doc that follows the xmdm26
  program to get the  autodial autologon to work properly.  Xmdm26.doc is also
  written by Leonard. ...

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I think I pointed that out.  All the Xmodem programs are
  revisions stemming from  Rick Perry's original XMODEM.312, which was also a
  revision ...

(Phil) [the perpetrator arrives!]

(Sysop Tony) of an earlier XMODEM.100.   Oh, good...

(Leonard E.) <my ears are burning>

(Sysop Tony) Leonard's here.    ga Leonard

(Leonard E.) Well, I came in in the middle  of Robert's comments. But I wish
  to correct his statement re ...

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I know... and we're gonna skewer you.  (grin)

(Leonard E.) XMDM26.DOC being required to make auto-dial/autolog work. It is
  required ...

(Sysop Tony) (just kidding)

(Leonard E.) to make the *program* work. I shudder to think what would
  happen if you tried to run with those lines missing!!!!

(Sysop Tony) Aha!  That may explain Robert's problem,  as well as Corky's
  problem. 

(Robert J. deViolini) I went ahead and merged the two programs as instructed
  to do. my problem was repeatedly getting stuck on line 68  even after
  responding to the "Find" prompt.

(Sysop Tony) Leonard, what do you do after a number is found?  How do you
  make it dial?

(Robert J. deViolini) That is what I didn't know before i logged into the
  forum today.

(Leonard E.) Line 68 isn't one of the "merged" lines.
  But as the docs state, you must press M, m, 3, 5, or 6 to dial, ESC to
  abort back to the "Find: " prompt or anything else to continue the search.

(Robert J. deViolini) Leonard just answered my question. Thank you!  was this
  the program you found the bug in, Tony?

(Sysop Tony) Leonard.... Larry, and Robert,  I have a copy of the program
  listing now and the DOC file  and I see that what I spotted as an apparent
  "bug" is not True, line 41 is missing from the XMDM26 program AS DOWNLOADED,
  but it is one of the lines created by running the merge file.  I had
  forgotten that.  So, with appologies to Leonard, the "bug" has evaporated.

(Phil) Leonard, could you comment on  why you constructed the program in this
  way?  With the merge file? (I have not tried it, by the way, being an X-TEL
  user)

(Leonard E.) Well, at one time I was running XMODEM.312 on a 16k 100 attached
  to a DVI (ie 8k of available memory). This "encouraged" (forced!) me to
  pack things down as small as possible. So I put in the graphics chars that
  Rick had in a subroutine, and removed the subroutine. Saved quite a
  few bytes. I've continued to keep the graphics chars to avoid having the
  version *I* run differ from what's on the board.  Maybe I should upload a
  "corrected" version with lots of CHR$()?

(Sysop Tony) And actually, Phil, the first version, XMDM25  had the
  "extended ascii characters" in it and we had considerable difficulty with
  the file in the DL.  It had to be stored as "binary", and that created
  download problems. ...

(Phil) [Remember, now!]

(Sysop Tony) So Leonard created this "merge file", which, when merged with
  the skeleton program, created the needed graphic characters.  that change
  became version XMDM26.100. Robert, did you have another question?

(Robert J. deViolini) No, just wanted to say that Larry R is probably in a dl
  chasing down that product review you mentioned, Tony.

(Sysop Tony) Leonard and I have discussed several common modifications to
  the XMDM26 program, and I've been working on some for a new file  but have
  also been working on a converted version for the 200 which is now up and
  running quite well.  One of these days.... "RSN" ...

(Robert J. deViolini) (I've got a 102)

(Sysop Tony) we'll have a file listing some neat modifications for the
  program.  (The 100 version works on the 102)

(Leonard E.) Tony, did you get around to checking out the ...

(Phil) Has it been validated on the M102 (some graphics are different!)

(Leonard E.) mods to support the call progress responses from "smarter" modems?

(Sysop Tony) (not in the way Leonard uses them, Phil)

(Phil) [ok]

(Sysop Tony) I have that list right here, Leonard,  but have not yet had time
  to make the changes in either version to test them.  Phil,  the graphic
  characters are used in function key definitions - not as printable graphic
  or displayed characters.

(Sysop Tony) Any more on this topic???

(Robert J. deViolini) No

(Sysop Tony) OK... then someone send a Q or a C, ...

(Phil) Nada!

(Sysop Tony) Or it's "slide time"  where I get to show you my slides.  (heh
  heh)

(Robert J. deViolini) UH OH!

(Sysop Tony) Phil left immediately!  Curtis... we haven't heard from you for a
  while.  What's up with you?

(Curtis G) BEEN VERY BUSY

(Sysop Tony) OK... that's a conversation stopper if I ever saw one. (grin)
  Well, if no more questions, we can close this conference early,  and
  save you all some connect charges. Any objections?

(Curtis G) No

(Bill H.) nope

(Leonard E.) no, but  I see that *you* are running 1200!  WAIT!!!!QQQQQQ

(Sysop Tony) Yes.... I've been running at 1200 for almost 2 years.  As a forum
  sysop, I almost have to!  many sysops have already moved up to 2400 baud,
  and look at us 1200, and ...

(Leonard E.) (only a sysop can afford 1200 CO's!)

(Sysop Tony) expecially the 300 baud users with a certain amount of pity.
  (grin) Well, I have to do a lot of housekeeping you are never aware of.  You
  had a question?

(Leonard E.) yes.  think anybody would be interested in 450 baud support in
  XM27 (or 28 0r...)

(Sysop Tony) You know, that has been disussed in the sysop forum.  There are
  some compuServe nodes becoming available which support 450 baud.  But I
  don't believe the Model 100 family can support that speed.  They might be
  able to with an external modem.  But I don't know of any 450 baud modems
  available.   And if buying an external modem, I'd think it best to move up
  to 1200 baud anyway.

(Leonard E.) well, any 300 baud modem will almost support *600* baud ( I used
  to do that!) I don't know if the internal modem can be set for 450, but I
  may try. I know in general what has to be done (the RTTY files help!). I'll
  have to try a couple of local boards that support it.

(Sysop Tony) I think that would involve a hardware modification.  But some
  folks might be interested in it.  I wouldn't give it a high priority,
  though.  It's sort of like converting the modem for CCITT...  it can be done,
  but mostly folks are curious as to "how", and never actually do it.  Well,
  we're slightly overtime here So unless there's anything pressing, it
  looks like we're out of time for this morning's conference.  So I'll end the
  formal conference now.  Feel free to stick around and chat further, if you
  like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we appreciate your input.   Bye.

  *** END OF CONFERENCE ***

(Bill H.) [have a happy belated 4th]

(Sysop Tony) Or a 5th, whichever you choose!  (grin)

(Bill H.) might just have one of those too. ha.
