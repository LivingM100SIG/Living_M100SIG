(Phil) Hi, trnascript!  Transcript is being strong and quiet today!

(Sysop Tony) Hi Phil.  Well, let's get started.

(Phil) Gene -- you need to do /han Gene or whatever.

(GENE NESTRO) WHY

(Phil) cosmetics!

(Gene) What was my name changed to?

(Phil) [lower case looks neat! <grin>]

(Sysop Tony) It now says "Gene"

(Phil) Now "Gene".

(ooie) How do I rechange it?

(Phil) now says "ooie" Good, I love it!

(Sysop Tony) Reminds me of "Fanna Danna, Banana Rama..."  Name game.

(R Caley) [Little Eva]

(Phil) Advasntages of laptops:  Now have two side by side on desk, writing
  with one CO'ing with other!

(Sysop Tony) Gee, I've been doing that for years. (smug grin)

(Phil) [Well, it just took me longer to get wierd!]

(Sysop Tony) Looks like I'll be joining the PC crowd around Christmas time.
  They have one at work, and want me to dabble with it.  Wouldn't accept my
  suggestions on what to do with it.

(Phil) Good for you!

(R Caley) [Say No! to MSDOS]

(Sysop Denny) It'll be painful, but it won't last very long.

(Sysop Tony) That's what they told Renee Richards.  (Get in on this
  scintillating conversation.)

(R Caley) Just a quickie Q.  I don't want to go read a DL file.  What's the
  best way to avoid all the notes and reminders and congerssgram junk when
  entering CO?

(Sysop Tony) Once you're sure you've already seen it, use ^P to jump past it.

(Phil) [come any time but Sunday AM]

(R Caley) Ahhhhh...thanks.

(ooie) Thankssssss

(Sysop Tony) But check the first couple of lines, we usually put new stuff at
  the top of the bulletins, forcing the old to the bottom.  But once you're
  sure you've already seen it, jump past it.  Same ^P works if you start to
  read a file, and want to stop.

(R Caley) Why doesn't Phil want me to come by on Sunday AM?

(Phil) I mean that the CO buletins are not here at othe times.

(Sysop Tony) Sunday AM is the time when the flags are most likely to be reset
  so everyone will see the bulletins.  One problem with ^P though, if you have
  messages waiting, and all that stuff and jump out of the Short Bulletin,
  you'll go directly to the function prompt, and miss the announcement that
  you have messages waiting.

(R Caley) thanks, I never get messages anyway.

(Sysop Tony) Actually, not exactly correct, Phil.  When we reset the flags,
  the NEXT time each user comes in, he sees the bulletin.  If he doesn't come
  in 'til Wednesday, it'll get him then.  If he doesn't come in for two weeks,
  it'll still get him.  It's a "Force to read next time in".  The one I hate
  is CompuServe's "What's New".  There's no way around it.  There might be.
  If you ^O at the opening banner.  Gene, you wanna change your name back to
  Gene?

(ooie) Not rite now.  The one irk I have is the (R) SERVICE NAME has been dis
  USE GO command instead.  I sometimes forget where I am.

(Phil) Yes, Rush, I was just joshing.  I thot you meant the announcement when
  you enter CO.  And I never see all that stuff except on Sunday!  Come during
  the week and you won't be troubled by it.  Hmmmm... he went away!

(gene) Gene's back!

(Sysop Tony) Good!

(Phil) [Slides?]

(Sysop Tony) Hey!  You guys wanna see something new?

(gene) Go for it.

(Phil) Sure!

(Sysop Tony) Be patient a minute, and watch this.

(Phil) is this to ooie?  He left!

(Sysop Tony) How about THAT!  Now let me see.  We got another one.  Hey guys,
  just showing you the new command.  Don't get bent out of shape.  Here's
  another one.

(Phil) Magic wand!  Voice will vanish!  What are some "bad" names?

(Sysop Tony) Whatdya think of all that?

(Phil) Who is "SYSTEM"?  Yeahhh!  Computer parses language and decides?

(Marty T) [Did somebody say MSDOS?]

(Sysop Tony) Nah, "System" is Sysop with the right flags. (grin)  Good point,
  Marty. (grin)

(Phil) Now guys, I liked it before there was a M100!

(Sysop Tony) We can also gag and ungag a disruptive talker. (heh heh)

(Phil) Good thing it's not the computer: Sysops would be in trouble <grin>!

(Sysop Tony) P'shaw.

(Phil) [see, there he goes with the racy language!]

(Sysop Tony) This CO started out slow, and then petered out.

(gene) Phil, wanna buy some magic wands?

(Phil) Who, me?  We use Gary Davis for our magic needs!

(gene) Who's he?

(Marty T) users 18

(Sysop Denny) actually, little Brian would like to make a comment.

(Phil) ['/ust 18']

(Marty T) [I know _ typo]

(Sysop Tony) (That doesn't work either, Phil.  grin)

(Sysop Denny) he's been dying to for as long as he's been sitting in my lap
  during CO's here he goes   n  kwa,  z;l:Q@ oqlqok
  ok now, wasn't that profound!

(Sysop Tony) Is this "Baby-speak"?

(Phil) Big improvement in your dialog, Denny!

(Marty T) Quest to sysop: was that inappropriate?

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, you'd better watch it, kid.

(Phil) Looksed like modem noise!

(gene) I'm a proffesional magician & I'm going to take on a new project.
  A Magic Show here live & on your LCD I'll work on it this week!

(Sysop Tony) You too?  Wanna see my slide?  Gary Davis, in the LA area, one of
  our members, and associate sysop on the Photo Forum, is an active magician,
  and there is a conferencing group of magicians in one of the forums there
  was an article about it in one of the last few issues of online Today.  I
  myself have dabbled, performing on stage and TV in my teen years; but now
  actively retired from the field.  But I buy an average of $100 worth of
  stuff a month.  It's addicting.

(gene) oh boy.  At one time I owned 2 shops & I alao lectured SF at the Magic
  Castle.  I'm a good friend of Dai Vernon.

(Sysop Tony) Really!  I was active during the heyday of Eddie Golden's Magic
  Wand in my home town of Pasadena, CA.  Been out of it for years though.

(Phil) We know Gary because he was a member of our LAUGH group in LA.  Where
  are you located now, Gene?

(gene) Reading, PA

(Sysop Denny) I didn't think ANYONE knew about Eddie Golden.  I did some
  programming for him in the early 70's.  Quite a character.  Used to send me
  grab bags of stuff every Holloween.

(Sysop Tony) Really!  Amazing!  I worked for him the in mid 50's.  He had a
  beautiful wife, who was a performing magician.  Unfortunately, she died
  early.  I don't know the circumstances, though.

(Sysop Denny) I went to his house in Newport Beach on one occasion.  Quite
  plush, and a bar that was the most complete I have ever seen.

(Sysop Tony) Last I heard of him, he was running a wholesale joke house in the
  Anaheim area.  One of those little towns down there.  Maybe Garden Grove.
  My mother and grandmother used to knit penis covers for one of his joke
  boxes.

(Sysop Denny) That's the one.  Actually, in Costa Mesa.  I HAVE ONE OF THOSE!

(Sysop Tony) Really!

(gene) [hmm...penis covers?]

(Sysop Tony) Yeah!

(Phil) [there's some of that language; where is SYSTEM?]  OR SOMETHING TO
  COVER?

(Sysop Denny) It doesn't work on Sysops!

(Sysop Tony) Well, I told you, this CO has gone to the dogs.  Yeah, it was a
  joke, something to keep your wig wam?   Whatever.  Amazing what a small
  world it is.  How lives intertwine on THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES.  (grin)  Well,
  enough magic.  Back to computers.  Although without the magic, we might have
  little to say.  Huh?  Gene, do you get all the catalogs?

(gene) Yes, still.

(Sysop Tony) I'll have to send you a list of what I get, and we'll compare
  notes.  Abbott's has a new one out.  Costs $7.

(gene) Tannens.  I manufacture some 'effects'

(Sysop Tony) Really?  What ones?  Maybe I have one.

(gene) Cigarette thru quarter.  Doug Henning did it on TV.

(Sysop Tony) Don't have that one, but have lots of milled coin effects.

(gene) This one is very good.  Kreskin uses a lot of my mental stuff.  I also
  use Johnson Prods/Calif.

(Sysop Tony) I've got an ESP one, laminated in plastic, in a pocket wallet
  with a BIC pen.  You know that one?

(gene) You will pick Blue?

(Sysop Tony) Nah, this has the star, square, circle, etc.  They "mark" one,
  and you tell them which one.

(gene) OK, I was thinking in a lower level.

(Sysop Tony) Fascinating.

(gene) OK here is a trick.  Everyone think of a number between 50 & 100.  No 2
  digits the same.  Lets make it an EVEN number.  Ready.  You all picked 68!

(Sysop Tony) Not even close!

(gene) If you didn't, you have to take your clothes offf!

(Sysop Tony) Well, let's talk celebrities.

(gene) Good Bar trick "You owe a Drink".

(Sysop Tony) You may remember Jack Cassidy?  He was in an episode of "Columbo"
  with Peter Falk, playing a magician.  One of his best roles and developed an
  interest in magic.  As I understand it became quite good at it.  Then
  there's Cher Amazingly enough, she's interested in magic.

(gene) Welll, Jan /87 this year on an episode of Crime Story, I was the
  dealer, a one line part taped at Vegas World, Las Vegas.  How about that?

(Sysop Tony) Immortalized on film.  Or tape! (grin)

(Bill h.) [I was on the T.V. news last week]

(gene) CAN you top this?

(Sysop Tony) I remember that one!  As you can see, Bill, this CO has
  degenerated to general chit chat.

(gene) Mon past I did a 2 hour lecture/show at Penn St.  Showing Magic is an
  Art.  over & out on this thread.

(Bill h.) [gene, been to the Magic Castle, in L.A.?]

(gene) Worked it.

(Sysop Tony) well, let's talk about Disneyland.  Oh, OK, wanna continue on
  this subject, huh?  well,



(gene) Did anyone ever recover a thrashed disk?

(Sysop Tony) Which disk drive?

(gene) TDD 1

(Sysop Tony) There is a utility for that.  It's part of the POWR-DOS software
  set from Acroatics.  Haven't used it myself, but I think Phil tried it out.

(gene) I couldn't get it to work.  How about you, Phil?

(Phil) Yes, it works fine for me.  But if the disk is totally gone then you
  cannot get it back.  Will work if only the directory is gone.  what happens
  when you try?

(gene) Can't recover anything.  Mite be a bad disk as I reformatted the disk &
  believe it or not Remember that! the disk will only store .DO files!

(Sysop Tony) What?

(Phil) Huh?

(Sysop Tony) (Stranger than fiction...)

(Phil) Cannot be.  Sounds like a software problem.

(gene) Yes, it will keep my adrs.do file etc but when try to load a ba prog,
  no luck.

(Bill h.) [magnetic mutilation]

(gene) How does it know what I'm doing?

(Phil) [magic]

(Sysop Tony) It's an "intellignet" drive. (grin)

(gene) Well, I tossed the disk.  Speaking of disks, I pay $20 for 10 ea 3M
  disks is that a good price?

(Sysop Tony) I think the last batch of Sony disks I bought were $13 for 10.
  Never had any problem with the Sony disks.

(gene) Will try them.  quite a savings.

(Sysop Denny) Sonys for .11 a piece.

(gene) Where?

(Sysop Tony) Denny can give you the address of a place in California to order
  from.  Data Dynamics?

(Sysop Denny) A place called Americal in the Computer shopper.

(gene) THANX

(Sysop Denny) (running for Computer Shopper)

(Sysop Tony) Oh, you got a new source, huh?

(gene) No got one here!  Sysops have secrets too!

(Sysop Tony) Last batch I bought, got the address from Denny.  Data Dynamics
  in Long Beach, Calif.  (800) 351-7832 or (213) 424-1172.  I ordered Sony
  disks, and they said they were out of them, could they substitute Maxell's.
  I said sure.  They sent the Sony's and marked the order sheet, "Maxell's out
  of stock". (grin)

(Sysop Denny) number = 818-906-1132.  Oops, that was 1.10 apiece in lots of 25.

(Sysop Tony) Hi Eiji.  You have any contacts in the "No" Theater in Japan?

(Eiji) Well, my father's CPA actually performs in it.  Is anyone interested in
  NO?

(Sysop Tony) Well!  Amazing... another small world!  I've been trying to get
  some of the hand-held streamers they use in the NO Theater.  Nothing I've
  been able to find here is similar.  You know the paper streamers that come
  in rolls and you throw out at parties?  Well the No streamers are very thin,
  and when held in the hand, virtually "explode" into hundreds or streamers,
  "jumping" out of the hand.  Do you think you can find out how I can get some
  of them?

(Eiji) That's must be the one they use as spider web.

(Sysop Tony) (Sounds like it)

(Eiji) I will check and will let you know.

(Sysop Tony) OK, thanks.  Appreciate it.  I might try to get a whole bunch of
  them, if possible.

(Eiji) What are you going to use it for?

(Sysop Tony) Gene, I think they would make a great magic effect.  Eiji,
  looking at them for a magic effect.  Any other topics of discussion?

(Sysop Denny) On those Americal disks, they are non-branded but definately
  Sony.  If you want labels, they are extra, .02 each and are the best labels
  I have ever used.  You can actually use pencil on them and can also erase
  what you've written.

(Bill h.) [amazing, somebody goofed]

(Sysop Tony) Shucks, I've GOT labels.  Pinfeed labels made especially for
  disks.  About 9500 of them.  I'm dying of hungry this morning.  No breakfast.
  What sounds good to you all?  Bacon and Eggs?  or what?

(Eiji) That's depends on what's in your refrigerator.

(Sysop Tony) Green mold!  Eiji, did you hear the one about the fellow who went
  into a Japanese restaurant, and said, "Gimme some Sushi... and make it well
  done!"?

(Eiji) That's funny, but not all sushi are raw.  Some of them are cooked.

(Sysop Tony) Really?  I didn't know that.  I like the rice cakes.

(Eiji) Octopus, eels, and egg cake are cooked, and some others that I don't
  recall now.

(Sysop Tony) Well, being a westerner, octopus and eels are not on my menu.
  (grin) Not much doing this morning.  Shall we talk about the sunspots?  I
  understand there is a basic program to calculate the rather regular
  appearance of sunspots.

(Bill h.) [if Eiji is right, I just found out the plural of Sushi or is Sushi
  the plural]

(Sysop Tony) If the plural of Mouse is Mice, how come the plural of Blouse
  isn't Blice?

(Eiji) Japanese language doesn't have plural form.  All nouns can be both
  singular and plural.

(Bill h.) very interesting.

(Sysop Tony) Then how do you know if you're talking about one, or more than
  one of something?

(Eiji) you put number in front, one sushi, two sushi, etc.

(Sysop Tony) Interesting. In English, "A basket of marble" and "a basket of
  marbles" are two different things. So you would say, "a basket of two
  marble"?

(Eiji) Well, I would say basket of marble, and assume there are more than
  one.  We can usually tell whether it's plural or singular from the sentence.
  You can G FLEFO and start a thread there.

(Sysop Tony) Intersting.  What's FLEFO?

(Eiji) Foreing Language Forum.

(Sysop Tony) Oh.  Interesting.  I didn't know we had one online.  I have a set
  of Berlitz tapes for Japanes but never really studied it.  Although I scored
  high on language abilities in college.

(Eiji) I guess you must be interested in lerarning foreign language.  By the
  way, for your breakfast suggestion, you can also visit cooks form.

(Sysop Tony) Well, I spent a year in Mexico at the Summer Institute of
  Linguistics, (read that Wycliffe Bible Translators) who have a very big
  language school down there.  But have lost interest in languages over
  the years.  Can hardly hold my own in Spanish any more.

(Eiji) I think you must keep using the second language in order to keep it;
  otherwise, it's easy to forget.

(Sysop Tony) And "think it", too.  You can't "translate" it into english all
  the time you have to get used to "thinking" in it.

(Eiji) That's true.  If you can dream in second language, you know you're
  getting it.

(Sysop Tony) Never thought of it that way.  When I was there, they were
  experimenting with the "langauge immersion" process, which became popular a
  few years ago.  Where everyone spoke nothing but the language they were
  learning, non-stop, for about 24 hours.  It was about 50% successful as I
  recall.

(Eiji) I think that will confuse me.  Need to ask some questions sometimes
  when I don't understand something.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, that was the common problem.  "How do you say this in
  Spanish?"  But apparently the technique works.  Last I heard it was being
  used in weekend seminar-type classes, 12 to 14 hours long.  You had books to
  refer to, but no other language to use.

(Eiji) I wonder if that also applies to computer languages.  Use only one
  lauguage for programming.

(Sysop Tony) I don't know if that technique could be adapted to programming.
  Maybe, but it would be something to hear ONE OPEN CHANNEL TO INSTURCTOR
  FOR INPUT TWO ASK QUESTION: HOW DO I DO THIS?  THREE CLOSE INPUT CHANNEL;
  OPEN OUTPUT CHANNEL FOUR WAIT FOR ANSWER  Gag!

(Eiji) Interesting.  Do you have any other topic?  Any other Q's related M100?

(Sysop Tony) No, actually there has been virtually NO computer info exchanged
  today. 

(Bill h.) IF you drop the line nos. THEN everything OK ELSE it isnt

(Sysop Tony) there was one Q re recovering disk files, but that was all.
  Mostly it's just been chit chat.  Obliviously, Bill (grin).
  Well, shall we call this one to a halt?  It's 11 AM on the Pacific Coast,
  so it's time to end the formal CO, formal as it was.  So, I hereby proclaim
  **** END OF CO ****  Thanks for coming, we appreciate your input.
