Sysop Tony: Tap tap tap... Meeting called to order.  Get the coffee, some 
baudee.

John R: Have things dried out down there yet, ynoT?

Sysop Tony: Oh yes, it's been very nice down her for the last several days.  
Where U?

John R: Do we have a quorum?

Larry L: decaf or regular

Sysop Tony: (Whatever)

John R: Berkeley

Sysop Tony: Still wet there... but at least not under 6 feet of water.  Anyone 
want to start us off with a topic?

John R: My January issue of Port. 100 arrived on Feb 21.  That's a new record!

Sysop Tony: Yes, that happened to most.  They weren't delivered most places 
until the week of Feb 10-15.  Personal opinion: They're the best, but never 
have had their act together.

Larry L: Still waiting for mine...grrr

John R: Agreed.  I think that they sould just stop putting dates on the 
magazines.

Sysop Tony: Seems like the last two issues I got of PICO were about 1/2 size, 
too.

Larry L: Seems like it is assumed that we all use our M100/200 for business.  I
use mine mostly for an electronic notebook and terminal.  How about you guys?

Sysop Tony:  Yeah, I do a lot of telecommunications, but also use it to write 
programs for another computer.

Bob R: Yes, about the mags, I enjoy the PCM magazine. I bought the barcode 
reader and it works well with the listings in the magazine. Only had problems 
with one listing. I don't have a 100 or 1200 so don't get much out of the rest,
though.

Sysop Tony: Seems like the barcode wand never caught on, and PCM does seem to 
concentrate on the bigger brothers.

Larry L: I am unfamiliar with PCM.  Could you go into more detail?

Sysop Tony: Well, PCM is the name of the magazine, it's listed in the file 
MAG.100 in DL6.  It's similar to many computer magazines with primary comverage
of Tandy 1000, 1200, 2000, 3000 etc... with a little 100/200 thrown in, and 
program listings in barcode form.

Larry L: OK.  Also I think it is possible to make a cheap (inexpensive) barcode
reader.  I will investigate.

Sysop Tony: There was an article in Byte magazine a year or so ago, that showed
how to build one out of an old fountain pen and parts...

Fred S: Good Morning Tony, and all...  I have a question on the proper 
construction of a null modem.  I have used one with 2-3 switched on my NEC, but
now have a 200 and the 2-3 cable switch doesn't seem to work.  Do I need to 
switch some other lines?

Sysop Tony: Fred, there are actually four recognized designs which are called 
"Null Modems"... Two of them are listed in the file NULL.MDM in DL5, and a 
third in the file FLTIBM.NUL in DL1.  The Tandy 200 needs handshaking on 
additional lines to make it work.  But the second design in NULL.MDM works for 
me. OK?

Fred S: Thanks Tony, as usual, a wealth of knowledge.

Gene: Is there a review on "Disk+" in this SIG?

Sysop Tony: Gene, there must be one in DL6, but I don't know the name of it, if
it is... Suggest a search on the keyword `disk'.  Use the command  S/KEY DISK  
to see.  OK?

John S: DISKPL.PRD.  Just happened to be paging through the DL catalog.

Gene: OK, thanks, I'll try later.

Sysop Tony: Thanks John.  Get that, Gene?  Amy more before we move along?

Ren: I am new at this. Help?

Sysop Tony: What help do you need, Ren?

Ren: Exactly how does this work?

Sysop Tony: What you type in there, is sent to everybody at the same time.  The
"(30 Name)" business is sent automatically.  When you're through "talking" you 
type "ga" so the next person, or the moderator, can "go ahead".

Ren: Do you need to address the person

Sysop Tony: Not unless you want to.

Ren: How good is the Chipmunk?

Sysop Tony: The Chipmunk is very good... It's the best we have available for 
the portables unless you want to convert your computer to the CP/M language.  
Any other questions, Ren?

Curtis: Very True

Ren:  I'll wait.

Roy: I'm New. What is The Chipmunk.

Sysop Tony: The Chipmunk is a portable disk drive for the Model 100 or Tandy 
200. It is AC or battery operated, uses 3.5 inch disks, and stores 358K on a 
single disk.  The operating system is transparent, and you can access files 
from your own programs.  OK?  Any specific questions, Roy?

Harry S: And doesn't come with the advertised software for the 200.

Roy: No, but thanks.

Sysop Tony: Harry, the unique RAM constraints of the Tandy 200 make it 
necessary to eliminate some of the programs which were available for the Model 
100 version, and to rewrite the others.

Harry S: I understand that now, Tony, but I feel it should say so in the ads 
and when I ordered it.

Ren: If a person has $500, what to buy first?

Sysop Tony:  The computer... (little joke there...)   What to buy depends on 
what one NEEDS.  No one can make that decision for you.

John R: (Very little)

Ren:  OK. Between a ROM and Chipmunk?

Sysop Tony:  Depends on what you NEED!  Disk drives will change the way you 
work, however, and programs in ROM may not be needed... their principle 
advantage is storage outside the existing RAM space.  Any more, Ren?

Ren:  OK, what do you use?

Sysop Tony:  Not a fair question, since in my position, I use the Model 100, 
200 and 600, The Tandy disk drive, the Chipmunk and another, plus a 1200 baud 
modem.

Ren:  OK, I'll listen for a while.

John S: REDIAL.DOC mentions utilities to make files invisible.  Tony, do you 
know any specific titles so I don't have to scann every possibility on-line?

Sysop Tony: There are two or three programs that do the job.  One is 
INVISI.100, one is UNVISI.100 and there is a file manager type of program too (
name excapes me), all in DL4.  They can be found quickly with a keyword search,
using the command  S/KEY INVISIBLE.  That usually pops up only the relevant 
files.

John S: Yeah, thanks.

Curtis: Any one have PCSG's SuperROM?

Sysop Tony: Anyone?  Reply now, or forever hold your piece!

Rob D: Me!

Sysop Tony: GA with question, Curtis.

Bruce: I'm using UR-I

Curtis: Tony, have you heard a delivery date?

Sysop Tony: They're shipping now, Curtis... I have no info on how long it takes
to get to the top of the shipping list.

Curtis: Thanks

Roy M: Are rechargeable batteries OK?

Sysop Tony:  OK for what, Roy?  You mean in the portables?

Roy M: Regular use in portables.

Sysop Tony:  Yes, but... Due to the lower voltage in nicads, you don't get as 
long a usage out of them before they need to be recharged.  Something like 6 
hours, vs 20 hours with alkalines.

Roy M: Thanks, I'm through.

Sysop Tony:  OK, one more thought... When they start to go dead, and the red 
light comes on, Zap!  They go down within a minute or two instead of the normal
15 minutes of alkalines  OK?

Jame: Hello, Is there a mini-logo program anywhere online for the 100?

Sysop Tony: No, not yet.  There was something in the January issue of Portable 
100, but I don't believe there is a LOGO language available for the 100.  Any 
more, James?

James: Yes.  I put it (the mini-logo program from Portable 100) into my 100, 
but am having touble getting it to work.

Sysop Tony: Yes, well, the program has bugs in it... Nothing new, many 
published programs have bugs.  There were some messages on the board last week 
about it.  Errors around line 6200 I believe.  Any more, James?

James: OK, I'll keep at it.  Not now...bye

Ren:  How to convert a .BA file to .DO file to use toolkt?

Sysop Tony: Easiest way is to save it direct from BASIC.  Load the program into
BASIC, then type: SAVE"NAME.DO".  That's easier than the book method.

Ren: I tried it; did not work.

Sysop Tony: Sorry, Ren, It's GOTTA work.
Rod: Try SAVE"NAME.DO",A

Sysop Tony: (Rod, the ",A" is not necessary)

Rich: Some new comers go to BASIC and try to SAVE"NAME.DO"... You have to be IN
the program.

Sysop Tony:  Ah, yes.  OK, Ren, revised instructions: Go into BASIC, and load 
the program by pressing F2 and naming the program; THEN save it with the 
command SAVE"NAME.DO"  OK?

Ren: I'll try it.  By the way, has anyone tried the bundled software with the 
Chipmunk?

Sysop Tony: Most folks who bought the Model 100 version of the Chipmunk have, 
yes.

Ren: How does it compare with other databases, etc?

Sysop Tony: Well, I haven't used that application.  (Anyone used PBASE?)  But 
it's disk based, and if you need that kind of program it's part of the deal.

Ren: How about downloading from M100SIG directly to Chip?

Sysop Tony: Yes, I've used that. It works OK, except that after using it, you 
have to be sure to "turn it off" or you can get cold starts due to the ML 
conflict problem... a normal problem with the Model 100.

Ren: I don't understand.

Sysop Tony: Well, when you are going to want to download to disk, you run a 
program that "turns on" the function before entering TELCOM.  When you're 
through, and exit TELCOM, you run the program again, and "turn off" the 
downloading function.

Rob D: PBase requires that you save everything to disk and clear your machine 
before using it. This is my main objection to the program.

Ren: Just one more... Any calculus programs available?

Sysop Tony: If so, they would be in DL2 with the applications programs.  Use 
the command S/KEY CALCULUS to find any.

Rob D: There is a book, "Computer Applications for Calculus" by William S. 
Dorn, which has functions written in BASIC.

Sysop Tony: Thanks Rob, that's a good piece of information to add to the 
transcript.

Bruce: ;This line feed deal has got me confused running `BANNER' on an Epson.

Sysop Tony:  OK, so you have a Model 100, and an Epson printer... any reason 
you cannot correctly set the dip switch in the printer to handle the line feed?


Bruce: Yes, it's at work and all the other progams need the current dip switch 
setting.

Sysop Tony: Is the Epson used with other computers?

Bruce: Yes, an HP-150.

Sysop Tony:  OK, then that's the root of the problem, you have to use two 
incompatible computers with the same printer.  In that case you need to add 
linefeeds to outgoing data from the Model 100 by setting up the function with 
the program LFUTL.PW1 from DL4.  Does BANNER attempt to defeat that?

Bruce: Haven't tried that yet, but have recently downloaded CR/LF utilities so 
will try.

Sysop Tony:  OK, If you install the linefeed function it may solve the problem 
with BANNER... also it may not (heh heh)  Good luck.  Any more?

Bruce: No more, thanks for the time.

John: If Roy is trying to cut down on his battery budget, you might suggest 6 
volt lantern batteries to him if he's still on.  Heard it here a few weeks 
past, mine works just ducky!

Sysop Tony: Yes, that's an excellent thought, and often overlooked... a 
standard, square, 6 volt lantern battery is available at K-Mart for $2.39 and 
will provide over 300 hours of use with the Model 100.  Just be careful in 
connecting the cable between the two... the inside sleeve in the plug has to be
the negative voltage.



Rod: My question concerns reading the messages... I tried to read just the 
last, but all I got was dumped back in the function menu.

Sysop Tony: There are a couple of ways to read only the last message.  If you 
know the number, then RInnnnnn will do it.  Need explanations why?

Rod: I tried RI and when it asked for the number, typing the last number, no 
luck.

Sysop Tony: Well, there are many variations, but if you get the "ask for the 
number" prompt, you probably went too far... however were you aware that there 
may be messages on the board that are sent privately, and that you can't read? 
Or messages between sysops that you can't access?

John R: Also the message may have been deleted.

Sysop Tony: Good point.  Any more on this, Rod?

Rod: I wondered about that but thought that the system would alert me to such a
case.

Sysop Tony: Probably not... the message "use" counter is separate from the 
actual message files, you probably just get the highest number used, whether 
that message is still there or not.  The most reliable method to read the last 
message is the command `RR999999'.  It always shows the last available message.


Rod: OK, I'll try it next time.

Rob D: Is there any software available in barcode form for the 100 other than 
from PCM magazine?

Sysop Tony: I haven't seen any, that's why I said that the barcode technique 
never seemed to "take off".

Rod: I just got a barcode reader when the price dropped, and entered PCM's 
barcode reader program.  It seems to have a couple of bugs in it.  One is in 
the CLEAR statement where it doesn't reserve the necessary space for B3OF9.CO.

Sysop Tony: Well, you'd have to contact PCM about that.  Someone once proposed 
the reader program be posted here, but at the time they weren't interested.

Rob D: What line number?

Rod: Line number 1020

Rob D: Thanks. I bought a barcode reader when the price dropped also.  It works
real well and perhaps some interest in barcode software may revive now that the
price of entry is a bit more reasonable.

Sysop Tony: Any more on barcode stuff?

Rod: In PCM's program, I would also suggest switching lines 1670 and 1680.

Sysop Tony:  OK... any more on barcodes?

Sysop Tony:  OK, then I'd like to get some user input this morning from you 
guys...  I noticed this morning that things seemed to flow better when the Q's 
were held in the Lineup, and the C's were addressed immediately...  Do you all 
think it would make the conferences flow better if we used a form such as 

"Send Q to ask a question or change topic; C for comment on current topic"???  
Anyone?

John S: Yes, when you ask if C is on current topic.

Sysop Tony: I meant that C's would be assumed to be on the current topic.

John R: I agree that generally a comment is prompted by the current discussion.
  Either go with the new definitions that you suggest, or invent some new code 
for a comment on some other topic.

John S:  Johns seem to think alike.

Sysop Tony: OK, I thought it worked a little smoother that way, and I noticed 
in the past, sometimes a C got stuck in the "Lineup" queue, and by the time we 
got to it, the subject had been changed... maybe several times.  Thanks for the
input, I'll pass the recommendation along to Sysop Dave.  Rod had the next 
question, ga Rod.

Rod: Returning to the problem of saving BASIC files as ASCII... the manual 
suggests that the extension .BA or .DO is optional and that the presence or 
absence or the ",A" controls whether the file is save in compressed (BASIC) or 
ASCII format.

Sysop Tony: Yes, that's what the manual says... but manuals don't always cover 
all the information available.  The concept described in the manual covers the 
situation where you type a program into the BASIC buffer then want to save it, 
either as a BASIC program or an ASCII (text file) version.  But if the program 
is already saved in it's tokenized form as a .BA file, then the easy way to 
change it to an ASCII form is with the command: SAVE"NAME.DO", rather than 
SAVE"NAME",A.

Rod: Whenever I have been confronted with the problem I always LOAD the program
and resave it as SAVE"NAME.DO",A.  This seems to work for me.  Are you 
suggesting that the ",A" isn't necessary, only the extension ".DO"?

Sysop Tony: Rod, that's OK with me... whatever works, and if you like it, it's 
OK.  However, as far as ease of use, when you want to save a BASIC program as 
an ASCII file, if you press the F3 key, you get the prompt SAVE"... to which 
all you have to reply is NAME.DO, and press the ENTER key.  The final quote 
mark is assumed.  If you do it your way, then you have to reply NAME.DO",A, 
which is an extra three keystrokes, one of which is made with the little finger
of the right hand, which is considered by touch typists to be the second 
weakest finger you have.

Rod: Thanks for the info. I'll try it. You learn something new every dau.

John R: The following all work, after first loading the program:  SAVE"NAME",A;
SAVE"NAME.DO; and SAVE"NAME.DO",A.

Sysop Tony: Thanks John... Last question for today, Go ahead Scott.

Scott: I was just wondering where I can get the programs out of PCM and 
Portable 100 on tape or disk.

Sysop Tony: I don't believe either magazine distributes their programs via tape
or disk.

Scott: OK, do you know of any programs online like the Dyna program in this 
month's Port 100?

Sysop Tony:  Well, as I recall, it's basically a modified BBS program, and we 
have one of those here... MININT.100 in DL1.  Three files... including 
MINIDO.100 and MINIEX.100.  You'd have to modify it to suit your purpose.

Scott: Thanks.

Rod: Scott can always get the PCM programs with the barcode reader.

Sysop Tony: OK, thanks for coming this morning... This conference is at an end.
  Stick around and talk if you like.
