  There are still a few folks frequenting the Model 100 who were here in
  the early days, four years ago -- and some remember when there were less
  than 1000 messages on the board (in June of 1983) and very few files in the
  DL's These messages have reminiscences from some of the early users.
  FAME.THD is a related thread, with informal (unsolicited) votes for a SIG
  Hall of Fame.
