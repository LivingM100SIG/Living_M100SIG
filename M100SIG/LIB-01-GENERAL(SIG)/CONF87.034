(LARRY R.) G'day?

(Sysop Tony) Good morning Larry.

(LARRY R.) Hello???

(Sysop Denny) Hi Larry

(Sysop Tony) Hello Larry... and Rowlfe!

(rowlfe) Hi folks.

(Sysop Denny) Rowlfe! you're back!

(rowlfe) Long time, but I have an hour or so to spend here!

(Sysop Tony) So Rowlfe, long time no chat. You still in Seattle?

(rowlfe) yes, actually Silverdale on the west side of the Sound.

(Sysop Tony) Well, we've missed you.  No special Topic for today: Your choice.
  (Check new commands available here with /HELP command.)  Send a "Q" to get
  in speaking lineup to ask a question or change topic; Send a "C" to comment on the current topic.

(Larry R.) I like, sometimes, 2 write offline and use <F3> uploading when I
  go online, not only here but often on private BBS  When doing this on some
  BBS, I lose the 1st 3-4 characters off each line.  Is there something, such
  as entering "nulls" on user options
  in the BBS, that I can do to remedy?

(Sysop Tony) Many BBS's don't have the software that will handle a constant
  incoming data flow.  They also don't send an X/off to stop your computer
  from sending.  That's THEIR problem, not yours.  However, Denny can advise.

(Sysop Denny) Larry, you can use SXM.100 in DL3  to enable you to tailor your
  setup  for the amount of delay you need  to work with bbs's.  in the
  documentation it shows you how to do it.

(Larry R.) Name of doc file?

(Sysop Denny) SXM.DOC

(Larry R.) Would've been my 1st guess!!! thanx

(JAMES) subject: use of Model 1 disc drives with mod100  how?

(Sysop Tony) Anyone?

(R Caley) The model I disk drive is identical  to the very 1st CoCo drive. one
  way he could use it is get DISK+ CoCo ver from PCSG and use drives for
  storage. No downloads possible  I dont think the Drive had a chip in it;but
  if so the disk would need to be configured properly.

(Sysop Tony) Thanks.  And James, you have to have a Model 1 connected to the
  drive...

(JAMES) i have

(Sysop Tony) in order for it to work.

(JAMES) what about "remote disk" software, page  43,  1987 tandy computer cat

(Sysop Tony) That's the software you use in the Model 1 to make it work.

(R Caley) Remote disk is virtually the same as DISK+  I think it was written
  by PCSG call PCSG or ask Mike A. if there is a DISK+ for Model I

(JAMES) thx

(Sysop Tony) OK... does that do it for you James?

(JAMES) what about drive for mod100?

(Sysop Tony) OK... (Important question coming up in a minute or two. - Stay
  Tuned)  James, there are at least five drives for the Model 100.  You can
  read about some of them in various files in DL13.  Browse with the command
  BRO/KEY DISK. OK?

(Gerald G) I did my homework last week and I  successflly connected the m100
  direct link cable (beige plug) to a 5 outlet  modular adapter and I am
  using term mode.  Next question is how do I  get the m100 to be used as a
  automatic dialer?

(Sysop Tony) Gerald, that is covered quite well in the manual.  Basically, you
  go into TELCOM, "Find" a number and press F2 to dial it.  Pick up your phone
  handset while the computer is dialing, and you will be connected after the
  number is dialed.

(rowlfe) (only if phone is hooked to gray line!)

(Gerald G) Okay for example, I am not sure where to put the colon, the number
  I use to dial cis in NYC is 212-758-4114.  can you give a format?

(Sysop Denny) ok  CIS:212...etc<logon string>:  the "<" and ">" are very
  important if you leave them out, the computer will think you are dialing a
  non-computer number  and will not wait for carrier.

(Sysop Tony) Gerald, read pages 88 to 92 of the manual. Lots of examples there.
  also, read the file LOGON.TXT in DL1 for EXACT examples of logon scripts.

(Gerald G) thank you Tony, that is just the file I needed.

(Sysop Tony) OK  An Important Question for today:  Some folks like the fact
  that we no longer add a list of CO participants at the end of the
  transcript. Others think they were useful ways to find peoples ID number and
  respond to discussions in the transcripts. Q: How many folks here want the
  PPN list at the end of the transcript. Signify by answering Yes or No,
  please, then we'll accept comments, if any. Add a "C" to your answer.

(Larry L)  Yes

(R Caley) Yes

(JAMES) y,c

(Bill E) yes

(rowlfe) yes

(Steve) yes

(David E) yes

(Sysop Denny) yes

(Gerald G) yes

(Sysop Tony) OK... that looks like a majority.  Go ahead with your comment,
  James.

(JAMES L. NUNN) but it does cost $

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that was one of the considerations  when I dropped it.  But
  as you see, most folks want it back.

(rowlfe) seems to me the extra $ is a small part of the whole cost of getting
  the whole file.

(Larry L) [please explain]

(Sysop Tony) Explain What, Larry?

(Larry L) ok  What extra $.  A 20 or 30 second list  cant cost that much.

(Sysop Tony) Agreed, but some folks are sensetive to that.

(JAMES L. NUNN) why not an /exit option?

(Sysop Tony) You already have that...

(JAMES L. NUNN) go both ways

(Sysop Tony) When reading a file, and you want to quit, just press Control-P.

(R Caley) that was my comment...when I am reading CO's  I just hit f2 and
  get out when I don't want more....easy

(Sysop Tony) OK... any more comments on the PPN list at the end of the
  transcript? OK... then back to the formal lineup  [Current lineup = Rush,
  James L]

(R Caley) ok  Question concerning CHANGE.BA  I have read DOCS and apparently
  don't understamd always have trouble trying to convert  HEX to CO
  files..haven't done one correctly yet any CHANGE.BA experts out there?

(Sysop Tony) OK... pressing F2, the ">Bin" key  will convert Hex to .CO, first
  time, every time.   Anyone else want to comment on CHANGE?

(Sysop Denny) If you get an OM error  you might have to change HIMEM  to
  reflect the top address of the program that you are trying to change.  you
  can find that by looking at the first number at the top  of the hex file.

(JAMES L. NUNN) do you have a 25 or a 100 mplan

(Sysop Tony) I'm afraid I don't quite get the question. .... What is a 25
  Mplan?  No I don't have a Multiplan program for the Model 100.

(JAMES L. NUNN) typo.  i am refering to connect time  reduced charges  for this
  sig

(Sysop Tony) The only reduced charges  that can apply, are those announced by
  CompuServe.  and they are effective for all users, at the specifid times.
   I understand that the Prime time rates  (during the day), will be reduced
  to Night time rates from April 1 to May 31, as a use test.

(JAMES L. NUNN) thx for that info  i am a new user.  and do you accept critism?

(Sysop Tony) Sure.  Go ahead and fire away.

(JAMES L. NUNN) this is slow compared to cb  i appreciate  the meeting
  management but isn't there a way  to expedite this mess?

(Sysop Tony) Well, we've used both forms, And found that many newcomers,
  such as yourself can't handle the free-form conversations.  And of course,
  you can "free-form CO" at any time, other than in this formal CO.  It's
  purpose is to deal with specific questions, and get supportive answers
  from several folks  online at the time.  We have a number of experts here
  on Sunday mornings, but a free-for-all simply wouldn't work for the exchange
  of specific information.

(JAMES L. NUNN) i will have  to accept that i guess....but you are very
  informative just slow

(Sysop Tony) Yes... we're limited to the typing speed  of the participants.

(JAMES L. NUNN) can u send me software on-line...anything?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I could send you software online.  But that seems a
  one-on-one waste. 

(JAMES L. NUNN) ok...let's do it

(Sysop Tony) We have over 2500 files and programs in the database  which can
  be dowloaded by anyone.  Why not look there?

(JAMES L. NUNN) where?

(Sysop Tony) James, apparently, you don't know how to use the data library
  yet. ...

(JAMES L. NUNN) yup  how?

(Sysop Tony) Suggest you leave a message on the message board, asking for help,
  and a bunch of people will jump in with instructions.

(JAMES L. NUNN) ok... how?

(Sysop Tony) What? you don't even know how to leave a message?  ...

(JAMES L. NUNN) i thought that was what this was...sorry

(Sysop Tony) No, this is the conference area.  The data library consists of
  over  12 megabytes of programs, tutorials, and files which relate to the
  various computers we support.

(JAMES L. NUNN) PLEASE  HOW DO I ACCESS THIS 12 MEG OF STUFF?

(Sysop Tony) That's too complex an answer to put here. ...

(JAMES L. NUNN) ok, fine

(Sysop Tony) it involves your reading several files, and learning how  to use
  the system.  If you leave a message on the board, we will reply, ...

(JAMES L. NUNN) ok

(Sysop Tony) giving you a hand-held road-map of how to find everything,  how
  to download, and how to make use of the various programs.

(rowlfe) james, at the "function" prompt where you came  in type a "B" to
  get the bulletin menu, and read the regular selection which has LOTS  of
  what you are asking for here.

(JAMES L. NUNN) thx rowlfe...i will and i will get better at this!

(Sysop Tony) OK... best we move on.  Steve is next  ga Steve

(Steve) ok How do I use XMODEM with CompuServe?

(Sysop Tony) Which computer do you have?

(Steve) (model 600)

(Sysop Tony) Ah!... there is a file in DL12 which deals specifically with that
  subject. TEL004.600.  Read that for step-by-step instructions.  Also, read
  the rest of the 600's TELCOM instruction files.  TEL001.600 to TEL005.600.

(Steve) Thanks, I'll do that.

(Sysop Tony) OK  No more questioners,
  so I'll drag out my vacation slides.  
(Sysop Denny) QQQQ

(Sysop Tony) Oops, there's one.  ga Denny

(Sysop Denny) OK, I thought, since we have Rowlfe here for the first time in
  eons, it might be nice to here from him on what he has been doing
  before he has to leave us again.

(Sysop Tony) Well, why not?  ga Rowlfe,

(rowlfe) ok  to be brief is almost impossible, but  here goes  You all know I
  was overseas for 6 months last year in Japan, and came back last Sep.  next,
  I left San Diego to come up here to the lesser gray northwest, actually the
  Trident Refit Facility in Bangor, Washington where I now get the  destinct
  privelige of fixing the biggest submarines we have.  I bought a house up in
  the trees, away from town, and I love it here  always so green, not brown
  like down south.  And I plan on staying here a long time  The only problem
  is the cost of CIS as I have to make a long distance call to Seattle to log
  on which raises the cost to about $9-$10 per hour  guess I'll just have to
  move up to 1200 baud. any questions?

(Sysop Tony) Rowlfe... GO PHONES before you leave, and check if there are
  any new phone lines up there.  They're adding new ones, several every week.

(rowlfe) Tony, did that a week ago, still Seattle.

(Sysop Denny) Well just have to push for a Bremerton node  BTW, I have found a
  source for rechargers for gel cel batteries  so you won't have to sit on top
  of them to make sure the don't blow up.

(rowlfe)  Denny, I built my own from a circuit in  the radio amateurs handbook
  which works fine.

(Sysop Denny) These are modular about the same size as a  M100 AC adaptor.

(rowlfe) Mine is in a small box  about twice the size of the m100 adapter.

(Sysop Tony) Hmmm... me thinks there is some good info for new files, there.

(Steve) This one is quick.  Does anyone know if the  Kermit file transfer
  protocol will be available for the TRS portables???

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  No.

(Steve) Yes and No?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I know.  No it isn't going to be available.  Insufficient
  RAM space to work.

(Steve) thanks.

(Al H.) Hi folks. Thnx. Just wondering if there is a good  powere supply
  adaptor for 12 VDC for boat/car etc. Approx. $ ga OOps for model 100

(Sysop Tony) There are a number of such adapters available.  You might check
  Radio Shack, as they have one to run radios and such from the cigarette
  lighter socket.  Also, Sony and Panasonic have them for their portable TV's.
   Check with repair depots, or dealers.

(rowlfe) very FEW of the 12/6 converters are worth the money  as they are
  not regulated very well and can cause bad things to happen inside a m100.
  Might I suggest buying a 6v lantern battery and the plug and using that?  I
  successfully have done this for a LONG time!

(Sysop Tony) Yes. ... a lantern battery costs less than 4 alkaline cells
  and runs for about 300 hours!  A real bargain, if you can carry the weight.

(Al H.) Thanks for the answers. will check it out.

(Bill E) Rechargeable from Sears,

(Sysop Tony) I guess, by that comment, that you mean there is a  rechargeable
  lantern battery available from Sears?

(Bill E) Yes

(Sysop Tony) OK.  thanks.  Send a "Q" to get in speaking lineup to ask a
  question or change topic;  Or it's vacation slides time.  ga Gerald

(Gerald G) Thank you tony and Denny I got the automatic dailer working, but it
  should be remembered to add <> after the #

(Sysop Tony) Gerald  there is a slight confusion among terms, here.
  "Automatic dialer" is a device that dials the phone.  and then you can talk
  on it.  That's a pitiful use of a computer, in my opinion.  But apparently,
  what you're talking about  is the automatic logon script technique in the
  TELCOM program.  Yes?

(Gerald G) Okay, "the automatic logon script" is working fine now, there were
  a combination of problems previously, mainly that  <sigh> I was using the
  grey plug before instead of the beige one to connect to the  duplex jack.
  thank you, your help was appreciated.

(Bill E) So much for homework

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Any comments, Denny?

(Sysop Denny) nope, sounds like he's got it!

(Sysop Tony) OK  Anyone want to bring up a topic?

(David Edwards) Tony  Can your macros be called within a basic program.

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  The new version (2.0) allows macros to be used  in BASIC.
  See the file MACROS.DOC in DL3. for details.  Oh, wait a minute....

(David Edwards) I was looking at it and I guess I missed that referance.

(Sysop Tony) Do you mean from within a RUNNING Basic program?

(David Edwards) Yes

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm...  Yes, I think you can.  You'd simply do a CALL to the
  entry address  in the macro routine.  That should stop the program, and
  prompt you for the macro number, send it, and return to the program.

(David Edwards) Ok   I will have to think on that.  I now work at a b dalton
  store and  had a question put to me about a use that may be answered by the
  use of macros.

(Sysop Tony) You might consider this;  Inputing a macro into a running program
  won't do much good,  unless you are at an INPUT prompt of some kind.  You
  may have to enable function key 6, prompt for input, and if a function
  key is pressed,  the program should accept the macro as input data.

(David Edwards) True. as I said some thinking is first in order. also getting
  him on compuserve to be able  to get the programs from you.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah.  I'll play with it myself, and see what I come up with.
  Potentially, that's a good application in BASIC.  Thanks for the idea.

(rowlfe) before I leave to go out for lunch, was there anything in the past
  which I promised to do which I didn't?  I have some notes on an old disk with
references I can't remember  what they mean.

(Sysop Tony) Not that I recall.  But we have missed your frequent input.  Come
  around when you can.

(rowlfe) ok  looks like the budget can afford every other or third week
  depending on what my work schedule is.

(Sysop Tony) Did you notice who's a Sysop now?  (grin)  The L.A.U.G.H. group
  is taking over!

(rowlfe) yes. what happened to Dave?

(Sysop Tony) Dave has accepted a contract with another service, and will no
  longer be sysoping here. He will continue to be active here, but not in an
  official capacity.

(rowlfe) oh  btw, even though i'm 1800 miles north, I am STILL a member of
  l.a.u.g.h.!

(Sysop Tony) We know! We know!  Coming to the picnic this summer?

(rowlfe) isn't washington a suburb of LA?

(Sysop Tony) I think HONG KONG is a suburb of LA!!!  OK... back on track...
  [Current lineup = Bill E.]

(Bill E) ok  Off track...  I'm in LA, how do I get into L.A.U.G.H.?

(Sysop Tony) Denny, grab his PPN!

(Sysop Denny) Ok will do.

(Sysop Tony) Bill, the LA group  is rather informal, consisting mainly of
  telephone contacts.  and occassional get togethers, and a summer picnic.
  Denny is holding the group together. (more or less)...

(Sysop Denny) [Anaheim Right?]

(Sysop Tony) so leave him your phone number, and get in on the (in)action.

(Sysop Denny) hey, I've been very busy!

(Bill E) Fullerton, actually, but an Anaheim phone connection

(Sysop Tony) (Yeah, you've got to change all the documentation from W-Link to
  W-port.) (grin)

(Sysop Denny) grrr

(karl) Q .. somewhat off the subject (I don't even  know what it is).  Is there
  a securities analysis program anywhere  in the DL libraries?

(Sysop Tony) "Q's" are allowed to change the subject.  The only thing that
  comes to mind, is a program to track a securities portfolio.  It should be
  in DL4, and the name, as I recall,  is SECPRT.MAL.  See also, SECPRT.DOC and
  SECPRT.CHP.  The latter is for a Chipmunk  disk drive.

(karl) ok.  Thanks, I'll check it out.

(Dana Hyde) Any more news on Camden Communications?  or Portable 100?...

(Sysop Tony) (Have you all read NEWCO.HLP in DL1?)

(Sysop Tony) Last week, the editor, Alan Ziechick  advised me the "January"
  issue was going to be mailed on Thursday or Friday.  It should start
  arriving this week. ...

(Dana Hyde) Great....

(Sysop Tony) Then they are preparing another issue which will be mailed in
  early may.  They promise that everyone will get all the issues they
  subscribed for, albeit a little late.  They are concentrating on the
  Portable 100 magazine, and got rid of everything else.

(Hugh Lochrane) Is Portable 100 having trouble?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I'd say so. .... They went bankrupt last year.   Laid off
  almost all the staff, sold off 11 other interests;  yes, I'd say they were
  having trouble.  (grin)

(Hugh Lochrane) I was wondering what happened to my subscription

(Gerald G) I managed to write a short program that   calculates simple
  interest.. first, which data library do  i upload it to?
  2nd i never uploaded anything yet and I would like to  try  out the m100
  upload feature.

(Sysop Tony) That type of program would go in DL4, with applications programs.
   But, of course, we already have a number of interest calculating programs.
   You may have reinvented the wheel.  But read the file UPLOAD.HLP in DL1 for
  specific uploading instructions, and file requirements.

(Gerald G) Okay, perhaps I reinvented another wheel, I'll read the file, if it
  is not appropriate after uploading you can  always delete it.

(Sysop Tony) Aw, gee,  we hardly EVER do that!  (grin)

  Well, it looks like we've run out of thyme for this week.  So, I'll end the
  formal conference now.  You can all stick around and talk if you like.
  Thanks for coming, and we appreciate your input.
