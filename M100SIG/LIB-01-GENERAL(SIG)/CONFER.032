(Sysop .^Dave^.) We seem to be gathering ....
  TOPIC this morning is Basic programming and I thought we could share our pets
  for efficient solving of problems. Wasn't really thinking of Byte Fyting as
  the subject, but that might get into it if suitable.
  F'rintstance: Isn't X$=INPUT$(1) a preferable Menu handling device rather
  than X$=INKEY$:IF X$="" THEN

(rowlfe) the second is preferable to me, when something is interrupt driven,
 since I found out that INPUT$(1) is not interrupted by the ONTIME$ interrupt
 so it is not suitable for using with COM etc.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Concur; that is why I said "Menu handling device" since
  INPUT$(1) leaves you locked at location; that is why IF X$="" is necessary
  for INKEY$ since the polling continues.
(Sysop Tony) Depends on use. Lotsa folks like to see the response echoed to the
 screen to be sure computer received it.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is a point, but INPUT$(1) reacts so fast that there is
  no doubt about reception unless the IF THEN loop won't accept the response.
(rowlfe) I did successfully use input$(1) by making a loop anyway and printing
 the character after the user input, then using instr function to search for
 valid input then print@ to erase if not valid and do it again. but it was
 cumbersome at best.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, sounds like a loop dee loop to me ...
  Eiji, you have a pet technique or problem in preparing WORPRO and other
  programs??
(Eiji) Well, I usually use INSTR function to compare the key input, and use
 ONGOTO to jump to whatever I want to do.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep; that ON X GOTO gig is nifty ... wasn't it you that first
  used ON INKEY$ GOTO around here Eiji?? Or have I gawt the wrong syntax?
(Eiji) I am not sure.  If menu choice is number like 1,2,3 you can use
 ON INKEY$ GOTO, but if it's alphabet, you must define characters in a string,
 and find the position of the input with INSTR, then use ON X GOTO. 


(curt) COULD SOMEONE SUGGEST A BOOK WHICHCH TEACHES PEEK, POKE, CALL ETC 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, very handy and easy to get hold of is David Lien's book
  "The TRS-80 Model 100 Portable Computer" which is sold at Radio Shack
  Computer Centers; then you can move into the Waite Group's series which
  includes five books, has very advanced stufff as well as Basic in the series.
  check at Walden's or Dalton's bookstores


(reid p) How effective is Custom software's BYTEFYTER in conserving RAM space?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, I hope there is sumbaudee here that has used it besides
  me ...
  ???? ...
  because it was named for me ...
(Nabla) not me, batman.
(Sysop Tony) I've used it. Very efficient... very fast.... Good program...
 When combined with RENUMber program, can't be beat.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [clap, clap]
(reid p) is RENUM essential to use w/BF? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, not essential, it is an entirely different program that
  renumbers very fast and efficiently and will save bytes from the GOTO and
  GOSUB statements if they take up fewer digits.
(Sysop Tony) Not essential, but renumbering can also save bytes. expecially in
 larger programs.
(rowlfe) does it concatenate non-referenced program line?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Program asks for line length max and I normally respond
  with 255 and let it go; everthing is compressed to such an extent that I cut
  out DATA lines first.
(rowlfe) just what I need for the backgammon, monopoly programs.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) HIGHLY recommend it tell Greg I sent you and maybe ...
  he'll charge you more.
(rowlfe) [gee, THANKS!]


(Nabla) While the great minds are assembled. Anyone here familiar with the 200?
(Sysop Tony) Yes.... and no.... what's the question?
(Nabla) Same old thing. Can I turn off and on the RTS line from BASIC?
(Sysop Tony) Sorry, that's still unanswered.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nabla, can't you do it with shears and a soldering iron??
  [let's get serious around here ...]
(Sysop Tony) (How about using the cassette motor relay?)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nabla, that last of Tony's is worth investigating; a LOT has
  been done in that area.
(rowlfe) it just might be possible, comt to think of it it depends on the usart
 and how it is programmed. I seem to remember at one of the LAUGH meetings
 talking about just this sort of thing. Mebbe the Hidden Powers book might shed
 some light on this. I'll research it while I am out to sea.
(Sysop Tony) Rowlfe, remember, it's already documented for the 100.
 Nabla wants the infomation for the 200. Apparently different UARTS.
(Bob R) in the rom files (8 parts in the dl section) there is documneted that
 the rts can be controlled by bit 7 of port B2H.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) But Bob, that is for the Model 100 and the question was about
  the Tandy 200 !!!!


(rowlfe) NorthStar Basic has an EXIT command to get out of a FOR-NEXT loop
 without completing it normally without glitching the control variable.
 Is there a way to EXIT from that kind of thing on the 100? or a way around it?
 In translating that is the last hurdle to overcome to get the backgammon and
 monoply games up.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) what is matter with IF ... THEN exit?
(Sysop Tony) Exiting a loop in Microsoft BASIC is different than in NorthStar
 BASIC. It's OK.
(rowlfe) does that mean I can use IF-THEN-GOTO n and not have trouble wilth a
 NEXT statement later?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) KEEEEE RECT !!!
(Sysop Tony) If you have further loops in the program you need to define the
 NEXT statement. to keep the stack correct.
(rowlfe) Thought so. Just did not know if control variable was satisfied.

(DAVID EDWARDS) I would like to know if a routin for talking to the portable
 disk drive has come out.
(Sysop Tony) Yes. One is called POWR-DISK... costs $39.95 and is described in
 the file POWR-D.PRD in DL6.  Another is called TS-DOS, and is sold by
 Traveling Software for $59.95. Another is called DSKMGR and is available here
 in DL5 for connect charges.


(Bob R) if you need to leave a loop early, and the FOR statement was
 FOR X=1 TO 100 then in the loop have an IF ------- THEN X=100:NEXT: GOTO--...

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't forget to remove all those 'GOTO' statements in your
  IF .... THEN GOTO ... lines rowlfe ...
(rowlfe) [GOTO's removed already.]

(Mike White) Re earlier question about getting out of a FOR loop. I was alwasy
 tought never to muck about with the index variable within the loop.
(rowlfe) [me too, hence the Q.]
(Mike White) different interpreters and compilers respond differently.
 some of my students in my FORTRAN class tried it in Microsoft FORTRAN (similar
 to you 'vaproators in most respects) and it blew up it their faces.
 i think it is good practice never to do it. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, have NO experience with 4train but know that in today's
  MicroSoft Basic for the majority of current computers it is perfectly
  acceptable practice. I'm looking at the code right now for a program I put in
  DL 2 for the Tandy 600 that was written for the Model 4 and IBM type
  computers. It is FULL of "IF .... THEN nnnn" type statements within loops.
(Mike White) Yes, it is always to IF-THEN your way out of a loop. What I am
 talking about is doing that by changing the value of the index variable in
 such a way that it exceeds the loop limits; some interpreters and compilers
 will let you do it in that the code will run, but its real easy to get things
 screwed up; the interpreter sets pointers that tell it where to go when the
 loop is finished, and changing the index can in some cases screw that up.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ahhhhh sooooo, follow you now, don't say that the pointer
  is 100 when it is really only 56 just to exit the loop.
(Mike White) yes


(DAVID EDWARDS) ARE THE PACKAGES YOU MENTIONED ON THE PORTABLE DISK
 USEBLE IN A PROGRAM.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, they are machine language routines, accessible from BASIC.

(rowlfe) Mike, exactly the problem. the syntax for the exit is
 IF-THEN-EXIT nnn, where nnn is a line number outside the loop. the exit
 satisfies the loop so that a NEXT X, if X was the control variable, will give
 an error of a next without FOR. I wondered how Microsoft handled getting out
 using a GOTO in that the control might still be on the stack, and liable to
 cause unwanted results if a NEXT was used later without a variable defined
 the shorthand version of NEXT instead of NEXT X
(Mike White) I see what you mean. In the basics i am familiar with exiting the
 loop in any fashion resets the counters so that any subsequent use of NEXT
 without a FOR will just give you a NEXT WITHOUT FOR error.
 I've never had a problem with that particular thing.
(Sysop Tony) If you exit a loop, and then enter a second loop the first loop
 counter may not be satisfied
(rowlfe) [nested loops]
(Sysop Tony) However, if you use a dedicated variable for the loop counter
 each successive loop clears out the previous stack counter.
(Eiji) I believe changing the index variable value is okay with M100.
 I remember reading about it in a magazine article somewhere. That's why I
 started to use it.  Within a loop, just change the variable to the last number
 of FOR--TO-- value.
(rowlfe) ok. will try it out and see. I'll let you know what happens on various
 combinations of FOR-NEXT loops with nesting. These things are nested at least
 5 deep at last count, and the EXITing is done to all kinds of strange places
 in the programs.


(rowlfe) anybody working a text editor that uses a proportional character set,
 like what is now being built in to most printers?
(Eiji) Since I got my printer, I wanted to add proportinal spacing feature,
 but I just quit since I got WRITE ROM.

(PAUL LOVE) I have an olly m-10 and want M/l  txt frmtr
(Sysop .^Dave^.) You can use just about any of the programs in the DL 0
  database as long as they are in BASIC; that includes PRINT.100, PRINTR.100,
  WORPRO.EM3, and the latest PRTEXT.BA which is rather powerful. None of those
  have PEEK, POKE, or CALL statements so there should be no problems.
  DON'T load any M/L programs in your Olivetti unless there is a 100% assurance
  that the program was written for the M-10; and we h'ain't gawt none of them.
  Afraid the M-10 is an orphan.
(PAUL LOVE) at least the price was right
(Sysop .^Dave^.) you can do a LOT with you Olly as long as you
  stick to Basic programs. Lotza luck ...
(PAUL LOVE) I loaded print.100 and it works ok


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Comment: Over the last two days I've been programming in
  rather advanced Basic with M/L calls for the Tandy 600. A check record
  program with sorting, finding, printing and all that good stuff using such
  statements as CALL RDELETE, CALL RCREATE, CALL RNUMPF and similar.
  Keeps astonishing me at what I can get to work !!!!
  Me oh my!!! Hope to finish before Wednesday.


(CLAUDIA) I was wondering where I can get some info on the PWR-DOS that I keep
 reading about in the DLX areas
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See POWR-D.PRD and POWR-D.REV in the DL 6 database ...
  the one is description and ordering information and the other is a review.


(Jay M.) I just bought a PDD yesterday, and was wondering what could be done
 to make a real OS out of it. I saw the stuff for POWR-DOS in DL 6 (though I
 haven't read it yet) can it be driven from BASIC?
(Sysop Tony) Yes. If you buy the extra software called POWR-DISK or TS-DOS,
 you can access the disk drive from BASIC.
(Jay M.) ok...will look up the info in DL 6 when I get back from class.
(DAVID EDWARDS) THE INFO IS GOOD.
(Jay M.) is there a review/info file for TS-DOS? Are there any comparisons?
 Does anyone have recommendations?
(Sysop Tony) (Info is ALWAYS good)
(DAVID EDWARDS) AGREED
(Sysop Tony) TS-DOS is being released this month, no reviews of the product
 yet; it'll take a while before someone writes one.  What sort of information
 do you need? I beta tested the TS-DOS program and have POWR-DISK, too.
(Jay M.) I'm looking for comparisons, et cetera - I'm hoping to standardize
 on one system (assuming they're incompatible) and stick with it. I want to see
 just how far I can stretch this machine.
(Sysop Tony) Product comparisons, in the computer program field are comparing
 apples and oranges; most programmers approach a problem from different angles,
 depending on their own talents.  As for POWR-D and TS-DOS, they both do the
 same thing, using different approaches. You can stretch the M100 as far as
 your talents allow. Eiji has done more advanced pushing than anyone I know.
 He asks questions I never enen thought of.
(Jay M.) I consider myself a proficient programmer; I'm just learning the ins
 and outs of the M100. This is my 9th personal computer, and I'm rapidly
 falling in love with it!
(rowlfe) [welcome to the club!]
(Sysop Tony) I do more work on the portables now, than on my Desktop computer.
(DAVID EDWARDS) I LIKE IT
(Sysop Tony) They're adicting....
(DAVID EDWARDS) YES
(Sysop Tony) We don't do much product comparison here, at least not in
 documented form...
(Jay M.) (heh)
(Sysop Tony) allowing each program to be reviewed on it's own merits.
(Jay M.) ok...I'll read the P-D stuff and wait for someone to review TS-DOS.
 If P-D isn't too expen$ive, I might even order it.
(Sysop Tony) $59.95.


(Sysop Tony) Well, I guess that's it for this Sunday morning....
 What was it Walter Crankcase used to say????
 That's all fffolks...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "Good night Chet"
