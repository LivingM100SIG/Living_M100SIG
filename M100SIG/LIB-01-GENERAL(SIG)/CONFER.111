(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay folks, as most of you know Acroatix has brought forth
  a major improvement in its operating system for the Tandy portable disk drive
  known as Powr-DOS; present this morning as guest is Ed Giese from Acroatix
  and last I looked we had some of the main users of the program that have used
  it to enhance the TDD. Joel, Don, and Phil are here too.

(Ed G.) Good morning everyone; I just wanted to start things out with a general
 question to the conferees:  I recently got some mail from one of the SIGGERs
 here who described "POWR-DOS" as a "hacker's delight" but not as the best
 general purpose OS.  If this is true, what improvements would be necessary
 to make it the best?


(Phil W) A couple of comments, Ed..
 First --- it is a fantastic product.  So I am talking improvements. In the
 context you mention,  the biggie would be M/L utilities; the D-Menu and Dtext
 functions SUFFER from being implemented in Basic, as compared to the *file
 handling* speed of TS-DOS or even DSKMGR here on the SIG.  Of course, P-DOS
 wins hands down in other areas.  But why not put some of the demonstrated M/L
 programming capability there into better/faster/smaller utilities?
(Ed G.) I agree with you.  I would have loved to get DMENU working in assembly.
 However, I guess in the excitement to get the product out, We went with the
 BASIC version.  Part of the problem was no doubt that we tend to compare
 things with POWR-DISK, and MENU.BA was greatly improved upon by DMENU.
 However, things could be faster still.  Now, I may be wrong about D-TEXT, but
 our tests (though limited) showed it to be disk-bound.  That drive is SLOW in
 random access. I really doubt that D-TEXT would be much faster in m/l,
 although it would probably be smaller.  You made comments, and didn't ask
 questions, so this sounds like a rationalization, which I guess it is. 
 Anyway, we may come out with a m/l DMENU now that we have the loading
 technique perfected.  That, BTW, was the last part of POWR-DOS to be
 completed, and is the part I personally like the best about the product.


(joel) having looked at D-Text a bit, I agree that most of the speed problem
 is the drive.  there are file management things I'd like it to do a bit
 differently, but so far I'm not good enough with P-DOS to write 'em.
 back to the first question:
 I don't think the "hacker's tool" accusation is entirely fair.  If all a
 person wants is to transfer files, then they should pick up DSKMGR and not
 worry about the commercial products; what P-DOS and the others offer are
 greatly enhanced capabilities.  What they LACK (so far) are software that uses
 those capabilities to good advantage.
(Ed G.) We had to draw the line as far as POWR-DOS utilities were concerned or
 we'd still be working on the thing now. I guess that with any product, there
 will be that tantalizing/frustrating time before there is much support for a
 product, when it is "just promising."  Even the IBM PC went through that time,
 although with all the developers, it didn't take long.  Here in the (relative)
 backwaters of the 100 & 200, it might take a bit longer for the support to
 come.  I can only say that if P-DOS takes off, we would be the FIRST to offer
 commercial support/application products for it.
(joel) agree.  blaming us, not you


(Sysop Tony) When is the 200 version going to be released, so I can have fun,
 too? (whimp-er)  and.....
 Based on Sales of Powr-D, can you estimate how many 200 versions sold,
 vs. 100 versions????  10%, 20%????
(Ed G.) As for the 1st question, I am still working on the conversion, although
 it is now pretty far along.  I feel terrible that some orders have been placed
 for the 200 version and we are still holding them.  We have to get moving,
 but the question leads me into a relevant point.  So far, our only sales
 (practically) have been upgrades of our own customers.  Portable 100, which
 hasn't appeared since JULY, has the advertising in it for new customers.
 What are we supposed to do?  I've had to take on contracting work to survive
 the slump, and that of course means less effort on the conversion.
 It's a cold, cruel world.
 As for the second question, the ratio of 100 to 200 sales is about 8 to 1.


(Phil W) Hasten to say that I do not think of it as a hackers tool.
 RECOVR by itself is enough to put this product on the applications side of the
 fence (and to justify the price).
 But, as Ed says, one always makes comparisons where they CAN be made!


(RICH L) I bought the original p-d; just what are the improvements for those
 of us that doesn't get 100/200 mag anymore and are in the dark.
(Ed G.) I might be as subjective as anyone else about what the best
 improvements are.  You should have gotten a newsletter detailing just about
 everything, but it is fairly lengthy.  To be super brief here, the best
 improvements are probably:
 1.  The improved loader, eliminating many conflicts.
 2.  The improved menu program, for those who use it.
 3.  The other applications, especially RECOVR.
 4.  The flexibility of the IPL routine, including the TINY capability.
 Incidentally, I wonder if I'm alone in operating my 100 much "emptier" with a
 DOS in place, so that the size of some applications is less of an issue.
 It seemed to us that the TINY solution gave us the best of both worlds,
 allowing access using (relatively) big files and lots of convenience for
 normal use.


(Don Z) Question on marketing. Since there are almost no places to advertise
 3rd party material in a world where you can buy 3rd party Commodore programs
 at K Mart. What are the restrictions that the SHack has put on their "express
 order" that seems to make it so difficult for items such as yours to appear
 there?
(Ed G.) Problem #1 with express order is that you have to pay the Shack 55% off
 the top. Problem #2 is that most people still won't hear about the product
 unless the mgr tells them, and problem #3 is that they are pretty picky for
 all that.  We tried to get POWR-DISK in the door with no luck.  Hopefully the
 better packaging of POWR-DOS (and the higher price) will give us a better
 chance.  We are trying already.


(jim b) when using tmpc with powr-disk, super rom crlf function is owverridden
 by tmpc print applications e.g., fdp, ptodo, etc.
 does powr dos solve this conflict?
 what is upgrade cost from powr-disk to powr-dos?
(Ed G.) As far as your first question, I may be ignorant, but does SUPER ROM
 solve CRLF problems in BASIC applications outside of the ROM itself?  I didn't
 think so.  If I am wrong, some one correct me, but if I am right, the real
 problem is that the TMPC utility programs simply use the built-in BASIC
 driver, which will add LF's if you put in the appropriate patch.
(Don Z) That data is saved in a file called WSPEC.CW
(Phil W) It is not a DOS isue, but is a property of TMPC that it seems to
 avoid the code which will be intercepted in high RAM by a Linefeed patch.
 So things like LFUTL will not add lf's to output from TMPC.CO.
 Utilities SHOULD be OK, tho.
(Ed G.) Phil is right.  TMPC, written by yours truly, was written in ignorance
 and bypassed the character drivers that allow line feed patches to work.
 However, this should not affect the BASIC utilities Jim, although WSPEC.CW
 contains LF information does that mean that other BASIC programs OUTSIDE of
 Super ROM will respect the setting it leaves?  I didn't think so, but some one
 correct me if I'm wrong.


(joel) a couple comments & a question:
 regarding leaving RAM emptier with easy disk access-- yes, true in
 the bank I use to access the disk.  The other two banks seem to stay about
 the same, over time; but they're essentially "dedicated", anyway.  I was
 thinking about just that issue this week; I've been working on a
 program and decided about half-way through that saving RAM was NOT a major
 concern.
 Second comment:  Am still planning to update the review, and another
 of SECTR0.
 and the question:
 RECOVR doesn't recognize MultiPlan spreadsheets.  Is there any easy way to
 fix that?
(Ed G.) (!!!!? RAM not a problem on the 100 ???)
(joel) well   less a problem....
(Ed G.) (Boy, things HAVE changed!)  As for your question, ...
 Could you elaborate ?  "Does not recognize?"
(joel) ok:  What it does is tell me it CAN'T be a .CO file, since the addresses
 aren't "right".  If I can't recover it as a .CO, I can't recover it.
(Ed G.) There are two possibilities:  The sector containing the first six bytes
 of the CO file is incorrect.  (Least likely.) Or, more likely, there is a bad
 sector somewhere in the middle of the file. RECOVR knows from the first sector
 EXACTLY what the length of a CO file should be, and if the "sector series" in
 question does not correspond in length, it complains that the file "can't" be
 a CO file.  Of course, the file might be damaged.  There is also a (groan)
 small possibility that a bug in RECOVR is making it misinterpret the correct
 length of the CO file.  I know ('cuz I tested it) that RECOVR works with CA
 files, which begin at 65535.  Maybe multiplan files are different; I assume
 they were at least similar.
(joel) Don't think any of those are the problem; think it's in Plan's
 addresses.


(RICH L) ED, WHY NOT ADVERTISE ON some of the mod-100 bbs' around? get right to
 the people that need it, like my bbs here in Atlanta?
(Ed G.) We will be pursuing that.  As you may know, Acroatix is a very small
 company, and we have to do contracting work to survive.  I guess we are the
 typical technology-driven types who make whiz-bang products and expect people
 to buy them without really knowing about them.  This will change soon, as we
 have hired some one to help out exclusively with the marketing.
 Contact me independently, and I'd be more than happy to provide you with more
 info, and even review copies.
(joel) On my BBS (in Lansing) this and virtually all new products get
 discussed.


(Phil W) This is an answer to Ed's RAM question and a Question.
 To me the big advantage of P-DOS is it's invisible disk access. As Joel said,
 there is DSKMGR (2100 bytes) for file management in m/l. But P-DOS is neat
 because of where it lives and a complete lack of conflict with high RAM
 programs.  I keep it in 5 banks (I think) and it is so invisible that I have
 to test to see if its there before using it!!  Now the question:
 With P-DISK there was a MAP.DO file.  Are you going to provide simillar info
 for P-DOS?
(Ed G.) One of the problems with providing that kind of technical info about
 P-DOS is that There is a VERY ANNOYING restriction on any software written to
 work that way : It must contain NO NULLS.  If a null sneaks into that area,
 The 100 (or 200) will start diddling with it, thinking that it is at the end
 of a line of BASIC code.  Now, to avoid problems, we not only had to eliminate
 all nulls from instructions in the code, but we had to ensure that the disk
 I/O buffer, which (necessarily) sits down in the same area, never had nulls in
 it, and consequently there are some places where we had to be very careful.
 It didn't seem fair to give people a map without fully documenting this
 behavior, and there was a lack of time (and frankly, desire) to go into such
 detail about how our software works.  However, we DID expand the MAXRAMC
 call list to cover just about anything that anyone would want to do as far as
 m/l calls to P-DOS was concerned.  Does this explain things adequately?
(Phil W) Yes, I think that does answer it.  If I come up with any functions
 not covered in the call list, I'll ask about it. FAir enough?


(Leonard E.) On the Multiplan problem: If Multiplan saves a file to disk
 it saves a BINARY *DATA* file, *not* an executable m/l file.
 (in spite of the .CO extension). I suspect that this was due to there only
 being 3 'official' extensions & .CO being closest to what is wanted.
 For what it's worth, here's the first six bytes of a multiplan file from a
 disk (DVI but since Multiplan wrote it it should do the same on TDD):
 81 1 1 0 15 0

(Ed G.) First of all, you are 100% correct about why multiplan files are CO
 files.  No other type gave the designers the (needed) ability to include nulls
 and ^Z's in the file. You will find IN GENERAL that the first six bytes of a
 CO file are:
 1 & 2.  The TOP address.
 3 & 4.  The file length (less 6, I think)
 5 & 6.  The EXE address.
 For multiplan files the EXE is always 63012 which is the access address for
 the option ROM.
(Leonard E.) [not on disk!
(Ed G.)  It is a clever trick. In some other cases, perhaps a different EXE
 would be used.  BUT ... The bytes 3 & 4 MUST MUST MUST be the length, or
 the M100 will very soon Coldstart. Perhaps this is one reason why coldstarts
 are so common.  Anyway, it is these two bytes that RECOVR uses to determine
 the length.  If they don't work, then the file cannot be safely loaded into
 RAM.
(Leonard E.) Ed, you missed my point! What *multiplan* writes to a disk is
 *NOT* a .CO file! It is data in some internal format. If you try to do a
 LOADM or RUNM on it you *will* cold-start the machine or get an error.
 it is nothing but *data*. The .CO files in *rAM* are 'real' .co files.
(Ed G.) I guess I did miss your point. I figured you were talking about
 Multiplan files from the aspect of recovering them with RECOVR.BA.
 Now, you cannot save Multiplan files directly to the TDD from within Multiplan
 using POWR-DOS. So I guess you were making some other point.
 But as regards RECOVR.BA, it assumes that ANY file with extension CO must
 contain the length (less 6) in the third and fourth bytes.  It doesn't matter
 whether the file contains data or program, because that length is used by the
 M100 simply to figure out where different files start in RAM.
 Am I still off the mark?
(Leonard E.) I was under the impression that you could write directly to the
 disk w.. Multiplan.


(joel) a couple technical questions....
 1)  Anything in SECTR0 that's WRONG? Anything I missed? Why do P-DOS and
 Tandy's Utilities have something at 1280 in sector 0?
(Ed G.) I didn't see any errors in SECTR0, but I'll admit I didn't proof-read
 it.  I'll take a closer look and let you know.
 As for byte 1280, it is not actually part of the "sector proper," but part of
 the 12 "marker bytes" used by the TDD OS to point to the next sector in a
 series.  Since Sector 0 is never read as a file, it really doesn't matter what
 goes in the "marker" bytes for it.  In general, these 12 bytes per sector are
 a fairly fascinating way to slip in some extra data.  As you have noted, the
 TDD is not all that efficient in how it stores information.
(joel) I'm well aware that IO and HT errors keep DSKO$ from reading a sector,
 and that about half of the sectors on the P-DOS disk can't be read, either.
 I'm not real interested in how you did that, but I want to be real sure
 I can't do it by accident.  Comments?
(Ed G.) I really don't mind telling you about how the HT errors are caused.
 More on why at the end.  But when you format a TDD diskette, you actually have
 a choice of six or seven different "packet" sizes that are used whenever you
 do sector i/o. Tandy only used two:  64 bytes and 1280 bytes per packet.
 It is the 64-byte packet that is so annoyingly slow to write, and why "rename"
 can take up to 20 seconds, as well as DSKO$.  I would use the 1280 byte packet
 size exclusively, except for one thing: The TDD CHANGES THE PACKET SIZE TO
 64 bytes whenever you write a file to the sector using the "file" utilities in
 the drive! This means that you cannot maintain a different "packet" size on
 a disk and still use it for "normal" file I/O.  This may seem confusing, but
 It's difficult for me to explain on the fly this way.
 restrictions related to disk use.  The "packet" size is what they must be
 using to allow their random I/O, and as far as we can tell, you must select
 this at formatting time. If you read the obscure section in our manual about
 FORMAT.BA, you will see that that is one way you can set up a packet size of
 1280 bytes.  This makes DSKO$ much faster, but you lose the advantage as soon
 as you write a file to a given sector.  Boy, that is a mouthful!
(joel) lose it permanently?
(Ed G.)  (to answer your question, until you re-format.)
 Anyway, DSKO$ only recognizes the two packet sizes used by tandy.
 So, DSKO$ will not read the other packet sizes, even though the TDD can.
 That is how we "copy protect" the file.  Using TS-RANDOM, or some
 appropriately home-brewed program, no doubt anyone could defeat our scheme. 
 No matter. We GIVE the non-copy protected version away as soon as we feel
 confident that the customer won't return it for a refund.  That was our only
 purpose from the beginning.  It's the rare user who will be able to pick apart
 our scheme, and THEN try to fraudulently return the product.  Feel free to ask
 for any clarification.  This is a pretty complex subject.
(joel) then nothing I'm likely to write to a sector will make it invisible?


(jim b) novice user here again== !st thnxs for ur help resolving
 powr-disk/super/rom & TMPC conflicts ovr the phne a few weeks ago.
 regarding powr-doss does it provide the user with any file aging mngmnt
 info such as date & time last written in some file directory that can later be
 printed showing such file info in printed form?
(Ed G.) Sorry, it doesn't.  That would be a very expensive option in terms of
 program storage, and I don't think it could be make fool-proof.


(Phil W) I have had some disks "trashed" (directory sector unreadable, but
 other sectors accessible with DSKO$).  What causes this (NOT a P-DOS
 problem, I must quickly add!)
(Ed G.) I'm not sure.  It might be a hardware hiccup, and I think that most
 likely.  The directory is written to disk more often than any other sector.
(Phil W) You mean a ROM issue? are there any software ways to make it more or
 less likely?


(Don Z) Ed, with your comments about 64 vs 1280 and, from the descriptions we
 have seen, the theory that TS Random will be using a format non-standard to
 Floppy and Powr-Dos in your judegement, is it possible that the future might
 hold the ability to store more data with the TDD, or do faster file handling,
 etc with non-standard formats?

(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Note: Travelling will be here in CO on 23-Nov
   TS-Random out in 2-3 weeks.]

(Ed G.) Don, my watch seems to say that the official end of the session is
 close.  So I will try to make this into a "concluding" remark of sorts.
 TS-RANDOM will be constrained to the same sort of thing that P-DOS does for
 sector access.  They may come out with a more imaginative way of using the
 same resources and there will always be different preferences. However, it IS
 possible to actually reprogram the TDD chip to use (TDD) RAM based software;
 in fact, that is what happens whenever you use the Tandy IPL program.
 A very enterprising person could figure enough out about the drive to actually
 bypass the TDD ROM entirely, or only use some utilities in it.  Then, the sky
 is the limit.  I'm not certain, but it may even be possible to reconfigure the
 drive for double density!  We haven't done any more at Acroatix than discuss
 these possibilities, and whether we ever pursue them ourselves depends on how
 well our current products do.  However, it is safe to say that any such
 ambitious program would HAVE TO BE ROM BASED, as it would take quite a bit of
 software to do what I'm talking about now.
 On that "Star Wars" note, I'll say.

(Phil W) [SUPER session, Ed! Thanks!!]
(Don Z) Very informative Ed, and A FUN PRODUCT!!!!!!!
(Ed G.) Thanks, all of you.  I really ...
 enjoy doing this.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Very nice timing there Ed!!
Super wonderful and many thanks to all for the inputs.
CO is ended but stay and chat all you want ...
