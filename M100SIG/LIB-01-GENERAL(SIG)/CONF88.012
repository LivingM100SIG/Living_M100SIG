(Ted Paul) Hi Tony

(Sysop Tony) Good Morning, Ted.

(Ted Paul) Rush Caley Suggested I drop In today

(Sysop Tony) Why not.  He's usually here, too.

(R Caley) hi ted!  hi tony  q

(Ted Paul) Will you be having a conf today?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, this is it.

(R Caley) Just thought I'd introduce Ted Paul  from CoCo Clipboard
  Magazine he wants to learn how a proper conference is  run with q's c's and
  taking turns.

(Sysop Tony) I see.  Well, Ted is welcome here any time, although...

(R Caley) [he doesn't want to see slides]

(Sysop Tony) he'd probably get more useful information in a COCO CO . (heh
  heh) But we recommend  newcomers read the files CONFER.HLP and NEWCO.HLP in
  DL1  for an overview of the way we do it.  ga Rush

(R Caley) just wanted to point out that the protocol in CoCo SIG is VERY
  informal they don't quite have it down like  you do here.

(Ted Paul) Well we had 37+ in conf. last night and it was a little
  disorganized.

(Sysop Tony) Well, there is a difference between what we consider to be a
  conference,  and what other folks do.  In many forums, it's a free-for-all.
   Anyone talking at any time they please.  That makes it hard for folks to
  follow conversations,  and very hard for newcomers to understand what's
  going on.

(R Caley) I've got CRDFIL and CRDFIL.pr1 going very well  how is development
  of CRDFILpr2 and pr3 going?

(Sysop Tony) Did you have a comment, Ted?  ga Ted

(Ted Paul) No, except I am learning my manners all over again, I'll just sit
  here quietly in the corner and watch, thanks for the chance to observe!

(Sysop Tony) OK.  The SEN's I sent you were as examples  of how we help handle
  the traffic.  They weren't meant to discourage you.  OK, Rush, PR3 is done,
  and is in the DL's.  PR2 is much harder mainly because it's difficult to
  think of all the options folks MIGHT want to use.  But it's in process.
  Remember my naive thinking that it could all be in one program? (grin) PR3
  is over 8K(!) just by itself.

(R Caley) ok  Well I think there are a number of nifty things
  you can do with CRDFIL if you have imagination  I was particularly
  interested in the person  who illustrated how to do a shiiping label  I want
  to learn how to set up a format for a billing going out to customers  of a
  private water company on those perforated cards  My client has an m-100, and
  I thought CRDFIL would be ideal.

(Sysop Tony) Sounds like an interesting idea.  Although CRDFIL might be a
  little limited.  No billing data updates, etc.  But as you say, limited only
  by the users imagination. .....  I'd like to see more reports on what's
  being done, to give us ideas of how the program is being used, and how it
  could be improved.  But alas, as usual,  There are more downloaders than
  feedback.   Let's see what Ted has.   ga Ted

(Ted Paul) Thanks Tony, 2 q's.. 1: What is CRDFIL and what does it do and 2:
  How many people do you normally get on these Sunday Morning Conferences? ..

(R Caley) [yikes]

(Sysop Tony) Well, CRDFIL is the currently "Hot" program on the forum.  It
  creates and saves a complete screen of data as a "card", which can be
  displayed, or printed in a number of formats.  It's like a box full of 3x5
  cards, each card being a single screen display. 

(Ted Paul) ?

(Sysop Tony) Conference attendance varies from week to week; the average at
  any one time is probably about 10 or a dozen but we have had as many as 50. -
  Mainly when we have had a guest speaker who was discussing specific topics.

(Ted Paul) Rush, is CRDFIL the Julie program for the Mod 100?

(R Caley) well, yes and no  Both Julie the Mouse and CRDFIL use a one box
  window to store information  and both are (can be) stored on disk  But
  CRDFIL is different in that if it runs as a RAM file, it is extremely fast
  on search But the principle is the same
  However, thanks to Tony,  CRDFIL has much more spohisticated reporting
  abilities because selected fields can be printed in any manner  Finally, one
  big difference is that Julie is totally freeform text  and has NO field
  names or set space alloted.

(Ted Paul) Thanks Rush, And one of your customers (Julie) needs some help
  please give Pete Sheldon in Dunkirk a call. I also wonder if Julie could be
  used with a CoCo RAM disk operation... oh well I must go and thanks to...

(R Caley) dont leave!

(Ted Paul) everybody for letting me drop in this morning.  Take care! <<Ted>>

(R Caley) Ted...

(Ted Paul) yes?

(R Caley) have Pete Sheldon write or call ME  I'll be glad to help him

(Ted Paul) Ok! Rush will do!

(R Caley) Yes JULIE can easly run in RAM disk (very fast)

(Sysop Denny) Rush, CRDFIL is very similar to both of the  ROM based programs T-BASE (UR2)
  and Lucid Data (Super Rom)  BUT with one major difference  you can have a
  CRDFIL data file on an external device such as Chipmunk, TDD, Booster Pack,
  etc.  It is the only one that has large file capability.

(R Caley) I was not the one with a q on CRDFIL  I use CRDFIL every day
  and I love it!!!.  But my external device is the D/VI  and it really works
  great using 80 columns.

(Sysop Denny) Yes, I was just making an additional comment.

(Sysop Tony) Rush, What do you use it for? Details! ga Rush, tell us all the
  things you've figured out how to use it for.

(R Caley) ok, but probably no one would do some of these things but me  As I
  said before, I am developing one for that water company billing card  They
  have tractor feed cards with perforations; one part would have
  name etc and the other would have info about the account  I wouldn't worry
  about sophisticated updates all you need is total, paid, balance,  and date
  of last payment. this is a small outfit  some of the water systems bill
  quarterly Another project I am working on is  just a CALLS, MAIL, Things to
  do, Appointment. FILE I put the type of reminder in one field
  So if I want to see CALLS, I search on that  The card would tell me who and
  what and whether completed Same with appointments and Things to do  It'd be
  nice to do searchs that would allow 2 fields. for examplle Give me CALLS and
  01/10/88 This program can also be used  like IDEA and project organizers
  although you cant "hide" certain levels the print program allows for
  printing selected data. Seperate "screens" could be setup by using a cross
  reference file...or by placing a secondary reference field in the same card
   BIG idea now...!!!!! how about this: Allow CRDFIL to access MORE than one
  file If both are in RAM..(or on disk too I guess)  In that way, cross
  reference data could easily be accessed.

(Sysop Tony) Let me discuss some of the points you've raised.  Gary Davis
  reported he found a half dozen applications around office and home in the
  first week.  Others have also mentioned several uses, but you're the first
  to come up with solid recommendations.  Just last night I was thinking of
  going back and refining the search routine in CRDFIL.BAS; to add the stuff
  that's in the TIP file. make the search field specific.  That would save
  time.  But search on 2 fields might be more than is commonly needed.  You
  and I could get together to get it working in a version for you however.
  One problem with accessing data from more than one file,  is that the TDD,
  which a bunch of users have, only supports one open file at a time.  So you
  couldn't do comparisons or cross-references.  You'd have to have at least
  one file in RAM.  After working on PR3, I'd be afraid that keeping track of
  file pointers and such, to deal with more than one file would add too{_-smuch
  code to the program.  And if it ever gets into a ROM form, as some have
  suggested I explore, it would have to be as compact as possible. 

(R Caley) ok...2 q's
  1.) can prg. AS IS find "CALLS  01/10/88"  if they are in 2 fields?

(Sysop Tony) No.

(R Caley) q 2) Can ONE file have 2 screens built  that can ~rbe toggled to with
  the arrow key?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's a possibility, although the existing program don't
  have that capability.  You'd have to store both sets of field names
  at the beginning of the file, and read them into two arrays.  It would be a
  whole new program.  But I would think that a search on CALL 1/10 or CALL
  1/11 would be useful.  That way you could store the CALL and date to call in
  one field.

(R Caley) ok  yeh, I thought of putting date and Type in one field  eg.. CALLS
  1/10, APPT. 1/10, TODO 1/10, etc.

(Sysop Tony) And I think a good addition would be to make certain fields
  invisible on output.  That could also be your search field.  A unique
  character at the beginning of the field could trigger it.  Whatcha think?

(R Caley) I'm not sure I under stand "invisible field"  If you have any search
  criteria, I suppose it could call all types from the file that had a "$" or
  whatever But putting type and date in same field  means that you cant sort
  by date very well.

(Sysop Tony) Well, you know that the sort leaves a lot to be desired.  But my
  idea was to have a way to make a field invisible on output.  A unique
  character on input would do it if the program didn't print lines that
  started with that character.  I'd think it would be useful to store some
  search criteria that would not be displayed on output.  Because of it's
  invisibility, it could be any length.

(R Caley) ok...sounds good,,,why don't you play with that
  idea? I'm better at understanding when I see it go.

(Sysop Tony) Let's see what Ron has to say.... ga ron

(Ron) In what DL is CRDFIL?

(Sysop Tony) The CRDFIL series is in DL4. Use the command S CRDFIL to get a
  list.

(Ron) Thanks

(Sysop Tony) Any more on that topic, Rush?

(R Caley) no....thanks Tony...I gotta run..

(Sysop Tony) OK  See you later

(Ron) I am using Lucid Data. Can I use my data templates in CRDFIL?

(Sysop Tony) I have no idea.  I don't know Lucid, and the CRDFIL program is my
  own development.  I don't know what it is, or is not, compatible with.

(Sysop Denny) Unfortunately, both the LD templates and data files are not in a
  normal text format.  They are similar to Lucid and Thought files in that
  they have lots of nulls in them that make them barf when put into the text
  editor. (I tried).  You would only be able to emulate the  template and then
  transfer the data manually.  On the other hand, I have some Chipmunk PBASE
  files that are going to be converted this morning  shouldn't be too
  difficult.

(Ron) LD templates are .DO files though. Does that mean I have to start from
  scratch?

(Sysop Denny) Yes, the data isn't a DO file so you lose it.

(Ron) Horrors!

(Sysop Tony) It would be a wonder if your LD templates matched the form
  required by the CRDFIL programs. CRDFIL was designed to be a stand-alone
  program, Creating it's own files from scratch, and all the in and out
  programs designed to match the datafiles.  It shouldn't be too hard to
  "recreate" LD files in the CRDFIL format.

(Ron) I will try it. Bet on it!

(Sysop Tony) Let us know how you do...  a CRDFIL.LD tip file, telling how you
  did it might be useful to some others.

(Ron) BTW... if I print my database to RAM, will CRDFIL read them?

(Sysop Tony) Again, your database is probably not in the form required by
  CRDFIL.  The first line in the file identifies how many entries are on a
  card.  Your LD template would not have that info.  The next group of
  lines Tell what the screen prompts (datafield names) are, and where  they
  are positioned on the screen.  Your LD template is not likely to have that.
  So I'd say almost assuredly, your LD database can not be directly converted
  for use with CRDFIL unless you do some manual editing.

(Ron) No,no. Just a RAM file of names,addresses,etc. seperated by a CR.

(Sysop Denny) Actually, that would do it. Just make sure that each record in
  the file is on its own line. ...

(Sysop Tony) That's still not the form required by the CRDFIL program. Do you
  understand me when I say your file won't have the template required by
  CRDFIL?

(Ron) Yes

(Sysop Denny) You'd have to create the template  manually. but that's not a
  problem if you know what form it's going to take.  I am going to do that
  with my Pbase files this morning I have a 20K address file that is useless
  right now and with a little massaging, it should work  just fine.

(Sysop Tony) Denny knows more about it than I do...

(Ron) OK.

(Sysop Tony) he's obviously using the program for something useful.  for me,
  it was just a weekend programming exercise that has become a major project.
  Good luck.  Any more on this topic, anyone?

(Ron) Parkinson's Law, Tony.

(Sysop Tony) Is that related to Parkinson's disease?  (grin)
  And just what is "Parkinson's Law"?

(Ron) Work expands to fill time.

(Sysop Tony) (Ah!  I agree!)

(Joshua) Having gotten into the conf. late, I was wondering  is CRDFIL only
  for 100/102's? does it duplicate any functions of the 200?

(Sysop Tony) Actually, no.  We have been discussing CRDFIL variations all
  morning.  It will operate interchangeably on the 100/102 or 200.  Datafiles
  can be moved from machine to machine with the proviso that 200 files may not
  be displayable on 100/102's because of screen differences.  But "duplicate
  functions".... No, I don't think so.  At least I can't think of any.

(Joshua) Like using the NOTE prgm, I mean, in the 200?

(Sysop Tony) Well, I don't use a NOTE.DO file.  Never have.  Also don't use
  ADRESS or SCHEDL.  CRDFIL is designed to save and manipulate an entire
  screen as a "cardful of data" - sort of like a group of 3x5 file cards.  The
  entire card is retrieved whole, and displayed as a complete screen.  does
  that answer your question?

(Joshua) yes thanks, I'll have to check it out for comparison.

(Sysop Tony) OK... DL4.  S CRDFIL will get you a list of all the files.

(Ron) Tony, does that mean there is no second "page" as in LD View?

(Sysop Tony) No, Ron, there is no "second page", just a single screen as a
  single card.

(Sysop Denny) I was wondering... I take it that you can only find records when
  in the search mode. Is there any way  to find duplicate records while you are
  entering data?

(Sysop Tony) You can only find records when in display mode, either displaying
  all, or via a search/match.  When entering data, you are not in display
  mode.  I see your application, though... (I think)  you want to be sure you
  haven't already got that entry in the file.  You can use the CRDFIL.CHK
  program to see, and if so, delete the duplicate entry manually.  Unless the
  file is on disk... which I haven't addressed yet.  haven't developed a way
  to "edit" files yet.

(Sysop Denny) That's exactly what I had in mind.  But the major stumbling
  block is the fact that you'd need more than one file open to be able to
  edit while you are entering data.  A delete function (stand alone) would be
  helpful for larger-than-ram files.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, if you were editing or updating existing data. ... But if
  you were only adding data to an existing file,  since the program does that
  via an "APPEND", you could open the file for input first, read through it,
  and determine if there was already a match in the file.  If not, append the
  new data.  Delete could be worked out easily for Chipmunk or DVI.  Much
  tougher for TDD's.  I'm sure you could work it out for the Chipmunk.  But
  that's another good idea for the programming basket.

(Ron) Speaking of TDD's, I tried to backup the utility disk on a new TDD2 
  and when completed, I couldn't get the computer to boot "floppy"  I tried
  this with 2 diskettes and in both cases a no-go. anybody else experiencing
  troubles with Backup.BA on the TDD2?

(Sysop Tony) Your best bet is to leave a message on the board for Phil Wheeler
  71266,125 about that. .... He's providing considerable support for the
  TDD-2.

(Sysop Denny) Ron, is Floppy's filename in lowercase?

(Ron) don't remember don't think so.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, at least in the case of the TDD1, you can't  copy the DOS
  unless it's in the form: FLOPPY.CO but I would ask Phil about this.

(Ron) I load "floppy" with the ORIGINAL utility disk but the backup of the
  original doesn't.

(Sysop Denny) The problem is that most backup programs can't handle ...

(Ron) I know FLOPPY.CO=TDD and FLOPPY=TDD2.

(Sysop Denny) a filename like "floppy_sys" (which is on the TDD1 dist. disk)
   The only way I have been able to make an exact copy of a disk  is with
  TS-RANDOM's copy program, which will copy ANY disk, no matter what format it
  is.  Unfortunately, TS states that TS-RANDOM doesn't work with the TDD2.

(Sysop Tony) Ron...

(Ron) OK

(Sysop Tony) Although I hate to suggest this, Suggest you copy FLOPPY.CO onto
  a cassette, then if the disk is ever damaged,  you can always reload FLOPPY
  from the cassette.  I guess that won't work with the TDD-2 version, though,
  since you never have FLOPPY on the menu.

(Sysop Denny) [right]

(}i{_Ron) OK  My problem is that I couldn't make a clean backup of FLOPPY on a TDD2
  using the Nrackup.BA prgrm  I have no problem making backups of my utility
  disk using FLOPPY.CO on my TDD Just wanted to know if anyone else has this
  problem with a TDD2?

(Sysop Tony) Undoubtedly that's the way it was designed.  Another "gotcha"
  from MicroSoft.

(Sysop Denny) [more copy protection]

(Sysop Tony) And of course, very few people bother to backup system disks.
  or any other disks, for that matter.  Only those who have learned from
  experience, bother. any more on this topic?

(Ron) Tandy tells you to backup the utility disk though, so why copy-protect it?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, Tandy has a habit of telling you to do certain things  But
  not how to do it.  They did the same thing with the 600.  ....  But I don't
  think they copy-protected it; it's just that the backup program was designed
  to deal with standard BA, DO and CO file extensions.  "_sys" is not
  something it can recognize as a valid file.

(Ron) Yup!

(Sysop Tony) Personally, I'd get one of the alternate DOS's for the TDD-2
  anyway they're much more useful.  And if you want to backup FLOPPY_SYS,
  I'd ...

(Ron) I swear by TS-DOS.

(Sysop Tony) use the alternate DOS's to try to change the name to something
  that could be copied then change it back on the new disk.  Seems to me
  there is also a disk directory peek and poke program in DL9.  SECTR0.TDD,
  which is where the directory is stored.  That might be usable to change
  the name.

(Ron) The witching hour approacheth anon, methinks!

(Sysop Tony) Yeah  Two topics today... CRDFIL and copying FLOPPY_SYS.  well,
  here's another fond look back at Christmas.

Any final question?

(Ron) Bye all!

(Sysop Tony) Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.
