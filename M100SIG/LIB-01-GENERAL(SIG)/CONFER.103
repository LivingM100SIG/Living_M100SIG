(larry l) I just got a PCSG Super ROM..so far so good; anyone here use it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, Phil has though.
  and Mike A. =>IS<= PCSG as far as we are concerned.
(Curtis G) I have it
(larry l) I was just trying to elicit off the cuff opinions; just had it for
 a day and I'm still figgerin'out how to use it. any instant advice?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If you have some plans at attaining Lucidity, then see the
  nine SROM??.TIP files in the DL 2 database.
(Mike A.) The thing that helped me the most were the "quick reference" cards;
 especially the "function key tree" outlines. reading the docs is great, but
 the illustration if F-key functions really makes it clear how to use,
 and it's the only thing I "bone up" on now & then.
(PhilW) ummmm..
 Mike, reading the Docs is TERRIBLE!  The documentation is the biggest problem
 with S-ROM.  But, Larry, you will be amply rewarded by just trying things
 yourself. LUCID is fantastic, almost as good as Lotus 1-2-3.  THOUGHT is
 equally good. WRITE I don't care for -- but many swear by it.  And Lucid Data
 is (based on messages here and my experiences) the hardest one to learn.
(CHARLES WITTNAM) Lucid Data is indeciperhable if you ask me!

(Rich W.) First, on the Lucide thread, I also found Lucide Data doc awful.
 Would love good doc; whatever happened to the contest result, Mike?
(Mike A.) Good question and I don't know the answer !
 I think Dec. 1 was announce date. Will check.

(Rich W.) I am puzzled  by what seems to be PCSG dropping out of big RAM for
 M100 race. are you conceding 256k to PG?
(Mike A.) Not yet !  It's just that I haven't heard of Cryptronics going
 beyond 96K at this point.


(larry l) I think the PCSG manuals are pretty good, though the tutorials are
 a bit hard to follow .  The ref cards are excellent.
(Mike A.) Thanks..ref. cards are all I use !
(Mel S.) Just want to say that the doc for Write is very much different, and
 very much better, than those of the other sections for SuperRom and wonder if
 the guy who wrote that one could be induced to write one on the other
 sections. PS -- anybody got an M100 and/or M200 for sale?
(Mike A.) Well, the two co-founders wrote the series. Sam redman did Write,
 while Micheal the programmer did others.
 Just goes to show proigrammers can't do Docs !
(Rich W.) just to add what I think is the specifc problem on lucid data docs.
 they go too far with tutorials, and never give the overview.
 1 neat section lsiting all possibilities would do it.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Betcha improved documentation for the Super ROM will be out
  the year following the Chipmunk Manual!!


(Sysop .^Dave^.)
   ALL please note!! November twoth we'll have Acroatix guest on Powr-DOS.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) for newcomers: a reminder that CTRL-V allows you to see what
  you've typed without sending it and CTRL-U will clear your typing buffer.


(CHARLES WITTNAM) I have finally decided to get Chipmunk drive based on info
 from Sig, but Being cynical by nature, would still be interested in hearing
 about any problems people may be having!
(Mike A.) [happy in 30 days or send it abck]
(PhilW) [which computer?]
(CHARLES WITTNAM) M100
(Sysop .^Dave^.) T'ain't a replacement for a 32 megabyte IBM-XT, but that was
  a Chipmunk on the desk beside Mortimer in the Online Today photograph of
  September.
(CHARLES WITTNAM) Many problems with getting the things fixed?
(Curtis G) Charles the only problem I have ever had in over a year is the
 breaking of the connection where the cable joins the computer as a result of
 many connections.  was easy to repair , just cut off the bad and remake.
(PhilW) The chipmunk is one of the best things ever built for the M100.
 I've had NO problems, especially with the latest operating system.
 The only caution is that it and the RAM expansions want the same space in the
 bottom of the computer.  So they are (in a sense) not compatible -- tho you
 can do it if you let some stuff hang out the back.  And the support for the
 'Munk is very good!
(Mike A.) (munk's almost as fast as RAM, too!)
(Denny T) If you need a cable, check out CABLE.PRD in DL6 
(CHARLES WITTNAM) Thanks, which RAM does the Chipmunk conflict with the RAM
 over? the 32K or above the 24K?
(PhilW) Anything ABOVE 32K. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is the expansion RAM boards.


(Loni) Back to that SN error in line 3298?
(PhilW) [huh?]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [TINY.ADV]
(Loni) You know I'm green at this, but... This is the only prog. out of a dozen
 that doesn't work right.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Very hard to trouble shoot a program without more detail.
  Did you checksum with DOWNCK.WM3 ?
  AND Phil, Denny, Tony ... How does one get a SYNTAX error from a DATA line???
  Is that what you get Loni?
(Loni) I get ?SN 3298, that's still a syntax, right?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep. And 3298 is a DATA line. Have you used DOWNCK on it yet?
(Loni) I was getting to that. I didn't understand what the checksums were
 about but will try that.  Downloading all these programs to get one to work
 can be frustrating.
(Sysop Tony) The only time I ever got a SN error in a data line there turned
 out to be a missing comma between two numbers. you should check the line
 VERRRRYYY carefully?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Loni, the checksum will confirm accuracy of your download.
(Loni) OK, I guess I'll download that DOWNCK.WM3 and try downloading the copy
 and fix again.
(Leonard E) I have found that you can get an ?SN error on a data line by having
 a type mismatch between the READ variable & the data.
   example: 10 READ A :GOTO 10
            100 DATA A, B, C
 (just checked it on the 100 next to this terminal) 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, never thought of that!
  Numeric variable reading strings!
(Leonard E) [or vice-versa!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Doubt if that is the problem, since many hundred have had fun
  with TINY.
(MARK S.) WHAT ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF DATA IN THE LINE.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That would be ?OD rather than ?SN.
  And Loni, let me suggest that you read XMODEM.HLP in DL 0 and consider the
  use of XMODEM.312.


(MARK S.) WILL THERE BE AN UPGRADE TO SUPER TO USE THE TDD
 INSTEAD OF A CASSETTE
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Not likely.]
(Mike A.) I'd agree with Dave. We had to make it work with everything, more or
 less, and new TDD software makes going in and out of Super quite easy.


(PhilW) I was going to say that making Super work with the Chipmunk (another
 PCSG product) would be expected before TDD file save/load compatibility.
(Mike A.) Er, uh I don't think we'll do either until the M102 question is
 figured out; seemingly a tough "nut" to crack.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Any word on the Tandy 102?
(Mike A.) Nope, still working to get past that "buffer" chip problem.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "still working" with support from Tandy Towers
  per Juge's letter?
(Mike A.) That I don't know, but intend to find out!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, let us know please!!
(PhilW) You left a message a couple of weeks ago that gave me the impression
 that PCSG was not going much further with their hardware support for 200 & 102
 (e.g., not going to fix the Chipmunk problems on the 200.)
 Could you  clarify that a bit?
(Mike A.) Well, that was before Tandy's latest tech offer. they inidcate there
 MAY be a way around it, but we're just not sure. we've always specialized in
 getting around such roadblocks though. that's how the ROMs came about!
(PhilW) But what about fixing the Chipmunk problem with the 200?
(Mike A.) I tend to be more pessimistic than Michael and Sam, too.
 and, yes Phil, the 200 problem will be solved when the M102 is.
 here's hoping it all works out !! 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks that EVERYBODY is more pessimistic than Sam!!
(PhilW) Is this not a different issue or is it the same hardware problem?
 I thought the 200 bus was brought out like the 100 is --- else the 200 munk
 would not work at all!
(Mike A.) Yes, it's TWO problems,,,hardware and software. the hardware is in
 the M102, but both share the same software problem relating to the Telcom
 changes between the 100 and the 102/200.  by that I mean the "auto hangup"
 feature (non-technical term!).
(Sysop Tony) I hope it gets fixed.  I'd like to be able to continue
 recommending the Chipmunk - Tandy 200 combo.
 And eventurally, get a 200 Chipmunk for meself.
(PhilW) A larger issue is continued support for this "family" of computers.
 If PCSG backs out, that woill leave only one major company providing support.
 With the new PC-compatible "Laptops" (an inaccurate description), I am
 concerned that the M100 et al will get lost in the rush to bigger bucks!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Bert Cohler had a good message inre IBM compatible "laptops."
(Mike A.) Well, yes there's that threat, but until the IBM'ers can make one
 that works as easily as the 100 we don't have too much to worry about in my
 opinion. But, there's the eroding magazine/advertising base that's another
 concern. let's hope Terry Kepner can revive Pico and add to or replace P100!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Note that Kepner has nothing to do with "Portable 100";
  to the best of my knowledge.
(Denny T) In that message, you also indicated that you were going to discuss
 this further with the "powers that be".
 have you had any word from them yet as to continuing support?
(Mike A.) Not yet Denny.
(Denny T) Ok, waiting breathlessly 
(Neil S.) Since Mike publicly questioned PCSGs continuing support of the
 Kyocera computers. I, too am looking forward to the answers from 'the powers
 that be'


(Neil S.) my question is about Portable 100.  When I called Friday, they said
 that the August issue was mailed 'two weeks ago' but since I hadn't gotten
 mine, they'd mail me one.
(Mike A.) [promises, promises!]
(Neil S.) Has anyone received one?  Call if you want one, I'd say.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Neil, if you called Friday you have more recent excuses than
  any of us.
(Rich W) I haven't seen 1 in months but a mag rack in the World trade
 (NYC) has it. makes me wonder if I shouldn't have subscribed.
(Leonard E) Well, if Tony is out, there were 3 copies left on the stand here
 Friday. I am *seriously* thinking about asking for a refund,
 but doubt I get one.
(PhilW) [Ha!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [refund = court case]
(Leonard E) bw the way.... I *really* would like to get a copy of the April 84
 issue. I was one of the people who didn't get one, and I might add, never got
 credit for it either!
(PhilW) It seems that those folks are pretty desparate now in a cash flow
 sense. all other excuses seem pretty lame!  NO ONE should subscribe and if you
 are a subscriber and want an issue, check your local B Dalton.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Historical note: in Oct '84 a staffer told me Povec delayed
  paying the Post Office as long as possible and that is what J.D. Hildebrand
  reported in his message of a month ago.
(Sysop Tony) I have 3 copies of the August issue left for anyone who wants
 one. But I agree with Phil on the cash-flow problems.  They will kill small
 companies.  Since P100 supports a forum over on the GEnie system, has anyone
 with an account thought of jumping over there and asking what's up?  All we
 have is rumor and speculations.  I'd guess they are selling on the stands now
 to get some money in, and subscribers are on hold.
(Neil S.) [GEnie=good idea!]
(Leonard E) I've got bad news for P100. A fact that many businesses seem to be
 ignorant of is that the USPS will not mail *until* you pay. If you send 5000
 mags and only have credit for 20, they'll only mail the 20 and hold the rest
 until you pay!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is what the non-Editor staffer told me in Oct '84 at
 Tandy Fair.
(MARK S.) IF ANY ONE NEEDS AUGUST ISSUES NYC NEWS STANDS HAVE PLENTY.
 SEE IF I COULD HELP OUT
(Neil S.) If you subscribe, call the Camden phone (not the 800) and complain.
 That is how I got a June issue free, and even a July issue before my
 subscription one came.
 No sense paying again for something you've already paid for.
(PhilW) [cost of phone call < newstand price?]
(Neil S.) [Camden <> Seattle, 2 min. =$.91]
(Sysop Tony) But Leonard.... P100 has just recently got a 2nd class mail
 permit. They used to have someone with a permit mail for them. that was the
 June excuse, anyway. But Mark... let me sell the 3 I have available
 before buying any more.  These are already paid for, out of pocket.
(MARK S.) [OK BUT IF YOU RUN OUT, I COULD HELP OUT!!!]
(Rich W) along same lines just wondering if PICO is still in business.
 haven't seen 1 in over a year.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Pico has not missed a subscriber delivery as yet, and is
 reportedly now in the hands of Terry Kepner.
(MARK S.) NYC HAS PLENTY ON THE STANDS  
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Where in NYC Nark??? 
(MARK S.) IN PENN STATION, WORLD TRADE CENTER, ANY SMALL NEWS-STAND HAS THEM


(Gary D.) Just received my PG 224K module and it works fine. except.......
 I have a password program with a POWER OFF, RESUME function. However,
 when I turn the M100 back on, it sometimes comes on in some other bank!
 Any thoughts?
(PhilW) what is the password program?  From SIG?
(Gary D.) Yes, but sorry, I don't remember exactly which one it was.
 anyway, I just put the cursor over PASSWORD and it does the power off
 function.  The, sometimes, when I turn the M100 on the screen is in Bank 1 and
 says "Password?" like it should, but other times like this morning, it comes
 on in another bank!. Weird!
(PhilW) that is wierd!  It should always come on in Bank 1, even if you shut
 off in some othere bank!  If you remember the program, I will take a look.
 It may have some code which emulates the PG designs bank switch program. 
 There is probably a way around it -- like turning off MENU before shutting
 down.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) 
   ALL REMEMBER: Nov twoth!! Acroatix here for Powr-DOS talk!! REMEMBER!!


(MARK S.) WHICH DOS FOR THE TDD IS THE MOST POPULARLY WRITTEN FOR
(Sysop .^Dave^.) seems that Powr-DOS is leading the pack currently. Evidently
  more sophisticated than the earlier TS-DOS, Powr-disk, or Disk Power;
  but I have =>NO<= opinion since I have no TDD.
(PhilW) See P-DOS.REV (DL6) for info on POWR-DOS.  It is that most feature
 ridden to date.  TS-DOS does some thing better (M/L menu set-up)
 and TS-RANDOM is in the wings (somewhere).


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gilliotantos of gullilltos to all ....
  t'is time to fold the bytes, seal the nibbles ...
  and close the Conference.
  Many thankees!!
