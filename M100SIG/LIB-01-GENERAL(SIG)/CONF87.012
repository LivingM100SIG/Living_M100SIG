(Sysop .^Dave^.) Editor is now here  and the conference will OFFICIALLY open up
  here with comment from Editor.
  Okay! Morning J.D. !!
  We are ready to launch upon this morning's discussion with
  the Editor of Laptop User.
  Topic: Laptop User magazine and future of Model 100/102/200 family.


(J.D.) LAPTOP USER is something of a homecoming for me, as I started in
 journalism with PORTABLE COMPUTER magazine on the west coast, which some of
 you may remember. I went from there to Camden Communications where I served as
 editorial director of, among other magazines, Portable 100. I figure I've
 covered portable computers in general--and the 100 in particular--longer
 than any other journalist in the country.
     It strikes me that I've used the 100 in many of the ways most users have
 during this time. I used to be a programmer, and for a while the 100 was my
 place for BASIC hacking. (Also an Olivetti M10 I picked up somewhere.) Like
 a disproportionate number of 100 users, I carried it around to press
 conferences and took notes, later to upload them for eventual publication.
 For a while, the 100 and M10 were my only means of communicating with a couple
 of BBSs that I frequented, and later I used it for E-mail on a Dialcom system.
 And now I use it like many other people, as a peripheral to my desktop
 system. So I think I've had a smattering of experience that matches what most
 100/102/200/8201 users have had.
     It seems unlikely that we can look forward to compatible but more powerful
 100-like systems from Tandy or any other source. The 100/200 is where it's at.
 So the future is in enhancing the systems with software and hardware from
 other sources. Luckily, the Tandy notebook computers are blessed by a small
 but committed group of commecial and enthusiast technical experts who have
 already expanded the system beyond what Tandy or Kyocera anticipated. There's
 little reason to believe this evolution will stop...as long as people keep
 buying the enhancements. In the baldest economic terms, this is why
 LAPTOP USER exists.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) JD, what departments do you plan to open with ?? Main ones?
(J.D.) Like any magazine, editorial is divided into features and departments.
 Departments, from front of book, are Mail, Telecommunications, Laptop News,
 New Products, Quick Reviews, Applications Briefs, and a Guest
 Editorial. (You won't believe who we got for the first issue!!)

(arley) As a starving journalist (& ex-programmer) my obvious question is,
 are u interested in writers?
(J.D.) some of them are unwilling to work with me again because P100
 stiffed them for payment. Any magazine is only as good as its contents,
 so you bet. Let's talk about articles. We may not pay a great deal <grin>
 but we pay fast and we DO pay. Give me a buzz at (617) 745-7027. 
(arley) Thank you.  I will give you a call.  
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oh Ho! is that your new Laptop User phone number JD??
(J.D.) Yes it is. We finally got the phone system installed Monday. I'm in and
 out of the office, but from here on out there should always be SOMEONE
 here during East Coast bankers' hours. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Take subscriptions at that number? 
(J.D.) Sure, happy to take subscriptions over the phone.
 But please be prepared to list the hardware, software and peripherals
 you use when you're asked. It's important for us to know that stuff when we
 plan articles, and we do plan to use subscribers for feedback on products in
 our REVIEWS section. 


(Ramsay) JD, what about us P100 ers who got stiffed on our subscrips
(J.D.) Ramsay, you need to work that out with P100. I'm not the person to
 comment on what's going on up there, but I know, as you do, that they're
 planning to continue publishing. I say give 'em a chance.
(Ramsay) Okay, are you maybe planning to pick some or all of us up?
(J.D.) Ramsay, I have no plans to purchase Portable 100's subscriber list.
 I did make an offer several months ago, but it was politely refused.
 They intend to stay in business and keep publishing.
(Ramsay) Okay, so what can we expect from your publication
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ramsay, note that Laptop User is free. 12 issues a year.
(J.D.) I may have covered this ground before, but
 let me give a quick tour. It's my impression that the M100 community is best
 served by a P100-like magazine with four major components: news and reviews
 about new products, programming tutorials, useful programs to plug in and use,
 and case histories detailing successful, innovative, profitable or just plain
 interesting uses of notebook computers. So that's what we'll serve up.
 A meat and potatoes kind of package. 
(Ramsay) Okay, you've sold me so sign me up and I'll be glad to
 send a donation to keep it going.
(J.D.) Let me explain about "donations" like the one Ramsay mentioned:
 More than half the magazines being published in the U.S. are mailed free to
 subscribers. The publisher's theory is that it's best to reach ALL the
 qualified readers in a market than to limit his audience to those readers who
 bother to fill out a card and send in a check. (If you're like me, you have a
 stack of those cards around somewhere for magazines you really intend to
 subscribe to if you ever get around to it.) Advertisers like the idea because
 it lets them reach the widest possible audience for their products. Readers
 like it a lot. There is also a school of thought that says if the readers
 don't care for the magazine enough to pay for it, odds are ;they aren't
 reading it and they're not going to respond to the advertising. For a number
 of reasons, I don't think that's relevant in this market. Surprisingly, a high
 percentage of the 300 people who have requested subscriptions so far have
 volunteered the information that they would be willing to pay. I am gratified,
 but have no plans of EVER charging for a subscription. 
(Ramsay) I understand, I have a T200 and seem to be a little under-able to find
 some mag to supply me with the info I crave.!
(J.D.) Ramsay, that need for information is what compelled
 my wife and myself to start Laptop User and set ourselves in competition
 competition with our friends in Camden. You really need a magazine. And
 just imagine that you were a software vendor in this market. You've been able
 to send news about your products (advertising) to customers just twice in the
 past eight or nine months, and both times the news was out of date. I imagine
 your cash flow would be hurting about now. If those vendors don't get a
 vehicle for generating sales--and SOON--they just wwon't be in business much
 longer. They need a magazine even more than you do. 


(arley) Will Laptop User be devoted exclusively to the M100 class laptops
 or will it also cover the expanding field of other (particularly PC-clone)
 laptops?
(J.D.) Good question. Thanks for asking. The full name of the magazine
 is LAPTOP USER: The Model 100 Resource. It's exclusively for 100/102/200/8201
 family. But you're right, LAPTOP USER by itself sounds kind of generic.
 I suppose it's possible that someday there might also be LAPTOP USER:
 The Toshiba Resource as a separate publication. But this new magazine is for
 Tandy/NEC notebook computer users only. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Most of those things are closer to
  transportables than to laptops. opinion.
(J.D.) Dave, that's true in the sense
 that they're used for the same purposes as desktop computers and with
 the same software. There is a lot of potential there for software publishers
 to write portable applications for MS-DOS systems. but they are extremely
 slow in coming. Traveling Software has done some good work in this area.

(JIM T) HOW DO I GET A COPY? 
(J.D.) Jim, I'll post the address at the end of the CO. Don't want to turn this
 into a sales pitch. Or see previous COs. The good news, that we haven't said
 explicitly yet this week, is that every laptop user on CompuServe is eligible
 for a free subscription. 


(CURT) WHAT is the 8201?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is the NEC 8201 made by the same Japanese firm that
  makes the Model 100/102/200. Supported here in S12 and DL12.
(Mike Kelly) WHO MAKES THE KC 85
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, that is also made by Kyocera and was evidently for the
  Asian market primarily.
(Mike Kelly) IS IT ANY GOOD?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Has no modem and it's ROM is not compatible with the 100.
  Less useful than the Olivetti M-10, and that was not successful.
(Mike Kelly) THEY ADV HERE THAT IT IS 100%   100 COMPATIBLE
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is wrong. We've had members test it and return it.


(J.D.) There are some important issues in the 100 world today.
 How long can we expect the 100 to continue to be available from Radio
 Shack or any other source. Most computers introduced as long ago as it was
 have since been discontinued. Also, how many people will continue to buy and
 use it when much more powerful laptops become available at about the same
 price?
    The answers are provided by the good communications among users and
 the third-party vendors who continue to expand the product. Many of the people
 at Polar and Purple and TSI and PCSG and on and on are geniuses. If you think
 of a need, they can meet it. A couple of weeks ago I heard about a new kind
 of product for the 100/102/200 that is going to change everything. It's just
 revolutionary, and it's going to change the way people think about
 disk drives, I think. So as long as vendors continue to sell their new
 enhancements, they'll keep bringing them out. Those enhancements will fuel
 demand for the computers, and Tandy will reluctantly continue to sell them.
 So that's the cycle. I see a user magazine is integral to it. (Of course,
 this SIG is just as important, though it serves a somewhat smaller audience.
 It does provide the vendors with crucial immediate feedback.) I guess what
 I'm saying is that we're all in this together, and this if you want great
 new products for your 100, you're in a perfect position to see that they're
 developed and offered to you. 


(Phil W) JD, I agree that magazines are ESSENTIAL to vendors, but the type of
 effect on Tandy is arguable.  They did not seem very influenced by third-party
 enhancements when they came out with a 102 replacement for the 100 -- which
 makes many of the (non-Tandy) enhancements unusable.  So its "hope for the
 best and prepare for the worst" I suspect.
(J.D.) Phil, it's easy to get caught up in the "whack the shack"
 mentality that 80 Micro promoted several months back. And I agree that
 sometimes it seems that Tandy doesn't have our best interests at heart. But
 I know that within Tandy Corp. there is great regard for publications, even
 when they come from tiny companies (as all the 100 magazines have). And
 Tandy folk spend a lot of their time thinking about how to treat customers
 and third-party developers fairly. I'm unwilling to believe that the 102's
 incompatibilities were a deliberate slap at third-party hardware folks.
 I would believe it from IBM or Apple, but not from Tandy.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Portable Computer Support Group will soon be out with RAM
 expansion modules for the 102. Don't know how many K though.
(Phil W) NOt a whack -- just what happened, in this arena, recently.
 Probably due to lack of knowledge, not intent. 


(J.D.) I should mention that with 50,000
 readers, LAPTOP USER is the largest magazine ever to serve this market. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) J.D., one thing you overlooked in your commentaary about
  "genius" is the work of the members of this SIG with some major advances very
  early on such as Xmodem protocol transfers and HEX to CO conversion,
  et cetera. What boggles my mind is the stuff that folks still keep finding in
  the 100. HURON.100 is a recent example.
  Makes me wonder "Is there an end?" 
(J.D.) Dave, you're right about the SIG's leadership
 role in promoting and advancing portable computing. And there certainly isn't
 an end. We got fanciful at the end of a CO you missed a few weeks back and
 talked about hooking up a CD ROM player with a 100.
 No reason it couldn't happen. But this SIG leadership role is also
 troublesome for a publisher. I have to face the reality that most of
 my readers haven't discovered M100SIG and aren't availing themselves
 of what's hear for the downloading. I can exhort them to log on, even
 (if I can think of a way) come up with a scheme to get them a reduced
 signup package or something...but the fact remains that most users don't
 see what's here. So it's a natural idea for me to request permission from
 the authors to publish it for a larger audience. Great for most of the
 readers, but it means SIG members just get a rehash and printed listing
 of what they'd rather just download here. Is troublesome. 


(Phil W) Re the future of these computer: Looks like TAndy will be here for
 a while longer, since they are about to release a new disk drive to replace
 the TDD.  What I'd like to see on the 102, et al, is use of the latest in LCD
 technology to get an 80 column screen having looked at a T1100+ (with definite
 thoughts of buying)...
(J.D.) [yeah!]
(Phil W) it's clear the technology is there and reasonable in cost and very
 easy to read.  A screen the size of the M100 would give 4 times the amount of
 text -- AND the benefites of full line length.
 Re things like HD and CD ROM, seems you need lots more contiguous RAM
 to make it worhtwhile -- since file size is now limited to about 25K.
 Many more thoughts like this (as I consider where to go for my needs).
(J.D.) You're right: screen quality and size is a natural place to think
 of enhancing the 100--and one of the biggest challenges from the other
 new laptops that could replace it for many people. So 100 needs to stay
 competitive. Re CD ROM, seems to me that with the right OS, you don't need
 to load the whole file. CompuServe has a lot more information on it than
 you're able to hold in a 100, but we can access it just fine by searching
 for what we wanting and loading just that part of it...right? Re contiguous
 memory, what ever happened to the PIC Disc? The most remarkable part of that
 underrated device was that it offered 64K of contiguous memory and a chance
 to run an (admittedly outdated) industry standard operating system. 
(Phil W) Well, That just made the M100 into a PX-8 or Starlet.  But you did hit
 a major point: the basic limitation is the addressing capability of
 the 8085 -- vs. that of the 8088 and even newer processors; much of the
 cleverness of RAM expanders is devoted to breaking that barrier, some with
 good success.


(J.D.) Phil, do you -- or anybody here -- know if NEC V-series chips emulate
 the 8085 sufficiently to even think about using one with a 100?
(Phil W) Well, they emulate the 8080 well (not the Z-80) so they are close.
(J.D.) [hmmm...]


(Mike Kelly) anybody want to buy a 200 cheap I'm thru being ripped off by mags
 and vendors
(J.D.) What's the trouble, Mike?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, leave a message in S14 on the message board.
(Mike Kelly) is there a laptop sig?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) What do you need Mike? This is about the only Forum devoted
  to laptops! What is the problem? 
(Mike Kelly) I'm buying a z181    you talking to me?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is correct MIke, trying to talk/listen to you.
(Mike Kelly) well to start off with I ahve a 200 and a chipmunk.
 does that tell you anything?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep.
(Mike Kelly) after I buy it then they let me know the problems.
 the vendor that is.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh, we've heard about that.
(Mike Kelly) with the demise of the mag I've had it
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, best of luck whichever way you go but Laptop User,
  at least, won't cost you anything.
(Mike Kelly) even ts with there blackjack
 I'm going IBM.  Tandt,mags and pc in tex won't get me again


(Ramsay) Okay JD some one mentioned, that a new PTDD is in the works;
 is that going to just another 19.2 Cassette?
(J.D.) Sorry, R., I'm not your guy for that question. Just one of the chickens.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ramsay, the TD-2 is to be 200K at $199.99.
  I've not been able to confirm RS-232 use, but that is probable.


(Ramsay) with the 8085 it seems to be a rather versatile processor, so why cant
 we expand ram use with the bank switching capability like in the 200?
(J.D.) Exactly what we DO do, R.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike A, do you have any comment on the expansion RAM not yet
  announced for the Tandy 102?
(Ramsay) Okay, so why not take it a step further and use it with....
 running programs and protection of variables? 
(J.D.) Ramsay, you're talking about some real tricky programming that
 could probably be accomplished with one program, or with most BASIC
 programs, but is unlikely to be a standard that's compatible with
 third-party software.
(Mike A.) Just wanted to point out our RAM+ ROM makes the RAM peform that
 way. It adds Basic extensions so you can address any one of the 4(current)
 banks. Check out Marv Miller's Email program here oin the SIG
 and you'll see he has options to dump your data into un-used banks
 and hopefully coming within weeks/months will be the jump to 256K!.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) any comment on expansion RAM for the 102?
(Mike A.) Right, same thing, only different configuration (so it'll fit on the
 40-pin buss outside)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Availability?
(Mike A.) That I'm not sure of at the moment.  I'll find out from the only guy
 who REALLY knows...the guy who puts 'em together in CA !
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, I kinda twisted your arm on this.
(Mike A.) I know price is $549 unless memory is failing, when though,
 I must check.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) How many K ??
(Mike A.) total 256K


(Tony R) wondering if the 102 RAM expansion will fit inside the existing cases.
 Won't have to remove it everytime we go packing, will we?
(Mike A.) T'aint no room!
 Yes, it'll be removed for travelling but it's that nice 40-pin connector, much
 like RS-232.
(J.D.) Strikes me that much of the future of the 100/102/200 family
 is tied to reality that these are for many users second computers for
 use with a desktop, usually an IBM PC. And although most of the major
 companies supporting the 100 have developed links of
 one kind or another for making the two talk to
 each other, a really convenient, highly functional link hasn't been
 developed. (Sorry, Mike.) I want to plug the 100 directly into the PC
 and use it as the primary keyboard, and brose at will through
 the disk storage and use the PC display. This is going to help ensure
 the 100's continued popularity, use, and support. 
(Mike A.) You sure make it tough, J.D.!
(J.D.) Yep. And there really should be a simple plug-in video
 interface for 80 x 25 or 80 x 24 display. I don't believe it's
 that tough a job, just that the market hasn't demanded it loudly
 enough. (heard rumors of such a product, but haven't seen it.) 
(Tony R) By "case" I meant the soft chip-tote style carrying case.
 Will the RAM be required to be connected to the 102 at all times or will it
 have backup power so it can be removed and carried elsewhere in the soft
 travelling case.
(Mike A.) Right; it will have Backup power, like the present 96K unit
 and that way, one could have more than one 256K plug-in.


(Phil W) JD, you will be intrigued by the features of Brooklyn Bridge.
 (how 'bout marketing this one??), a product to link PC laptops...
(J.D.) [I just secured on option to buy the Brooklyn Bridge!]
(Phil W) to desk tops.  Gives the laptop full use of the PC's disks (incl HD)
 other devices, etc -- all at 112K baud across the RS-232.
 Seems possible that a similar M100-oriented product could be developed,
 if the market were there.
(J.D.) I think so too. HP had a similar product called the Portable-
 Desktop Link that used the HP-IL -- good idea. So how come
 we innovators in 100-land are behind? 


(Bob S) Re: plugin i/f
 I heard there is a device that plugs into the RS232 port on back of a terminal
 to map the screen on the crt.  It is almost ready to market and is being
 beta-tested. Any thoughts, 
(J.D.) RS-232 wouldn't be my first choice, but if it's cheap enough and it
 works, it oughtta sell ok.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) JD, do you have regular columnists lined up for Laptop?
  Or intend to do so?
(J.D.) Well, Alan L. Zeichick ought to be writing for us fairly regularly. He's
 come up with some fairly innovative code in the past, though he thinks of
 himself primarily as an IBM PC programmer. So he'll be around. I've also
 landed a surprising fish who'll appear in the first issue, or maybe the
 second. You all know the name, and I think you'll be surprised to see him
 in Laptop User. 


(Marty T) How do we get JDJD's new mag?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See MAG.100 in the DL 13 database for address
  [or end of this file]
  Laptop User is free!
(J.D.) DO include a list of the hardware and software you use.
 DO NOT include a check!


(Ramsay) JD - is your mag going to include Hardware Projects for us weekend,
 backyard do-it-yourself electronics experts?
(J.D.) I have one lined up, but not for issue #1.
 Unless of course Phil gets a V-30 installed by then
 and chooses to share his experiences with us!! 


(Tony R) M100 users over on the Journalism Forum are all atwitter over the
 disappearance of RS acoustic cups.  Anybody know anything about the mystery
 and when the long rumored new cups are to appear?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Word is they're coming out with better ones
  and Mortimer sez "Patience else patients"


(Bill E.) Will Lap Top cover the 600?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope.
(J.D.) Nope.
 Nope is the answer. Short and long. Too different, too few units in
 the field. No point.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Bill, the 600 system is so totally unlike the 100 family
  that it is out of the picture for Laptop User. Sometimes I feel as though
  I'm the only software developer for the Tandy 600.
  [plus Don Clerc and a few others.]
(Bill E.) Sometimes I feel like I'm the only user.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not so! Hope you have DBASES.600 from DL 11 here;
  and better is being worked on!


(JIM S) Please tell me about subscribing to the new mag.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) JD, why not give that closing information now??
(J.D.) Okay, and thanks for having me here. Would like to make the point that
 many of you have volunteered payment for subs and asked for ways you can
 help. There is a way. If you think a magazine is important--
 whether it's Laptop User or Portable 100 or any other magazinne--
 TELL the vendor where you heard about his product when you order it or
 call to ask questions. Let the advertiser know that by supporting the
 magazine, he is supporting the users. It's the most effective way to
 make sure that these magazines stay in business.
    To subscribe, please send your name and address along with a list of the
 hardware and software you use to:
        LAPTOP USER
        Shoestring Publications
        P.O. Box 712
        Salem, MA 01970

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Many thanks JD and very pleased to have you visit with us.
  Folks may stay tuned to chat as they wish ...
  but formal conference is closed ....
  Many thanks to all!
