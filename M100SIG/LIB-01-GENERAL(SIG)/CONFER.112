(Sysop Tony) Hi larry.  You is an early-bird!

(larry l) yes..cause I don't get to stay on long.

(Sysop Tony) I see... well, what's on your mind?

(larry l) Any special topic today?

(Sysop Tony) No, open topics today.

(larry l) I bought two new toys for theM100 this week...the TTXpress printer
  and the Trav elcomm 1200 baud modem

(Sysop Tony) Ah!  Welcome to the 1200 crowd! ....
  Denny has some programs in DL1 that are for 1200 baud users.  QHAYES in one.
(larry l) Yes...I already use the scroll killer routine already..ga


(Sysop Tony)   Well, guess we better get started...
  Send "Q" to get in speaking lineup, "C" to comment on current
  topic... Speaking Lineup = 0

(Peter T.) I have a friend with a local
  bbs who set aside an area...
  for me to use for uploads. ..
  Use SXM.BA from the SIG...
  However, now I don't seem to be able...
  to upload in any manner.  He just went...
  to a MS-DOS system from TRS.  Any...
  ideas as to why? ga

(Sysop Tony) Peter, we lost your line after "He just went..." ....
  However, did he change his software?  ga

(Peter T.) He just swithched to MS-DOS...
  and now I have the problem. ga

(Phil W) Need to know what happens when you try to upload...
  and whether you are doing message or file (xmodem) uploads..
  also what BBS softwre (Fido . PC-RBBS, etc) is he running? ga Peter

(Peter T.) I believe the system is PC-RBBS. ...
  As for the problem, when I try a...
  regular upload without anything..
  it immediately aborts.  When I try...
  Xmodem, part of the file gets ther..
  but only "0" and "1".  Not the ...
  complete file. ga

(Phil W) Only "0" and "1" ??? ga

(Peter T.) Yes, what I am...
  send is a text file (DO), but when...
  the little bit of the file gets to...
  the board it is "0" and "1"s. ga

(Phil W) Wierd stuff!  If you are able to make it work with other BBS's...
  I wuld get a message to Rick Mendosa.  If not, try another download...
  I have not used SXM with a PC-RBBS, but there is not good reason..
  I know of for it not to work. ga

(Peter T.) Okay.  Probably a system...
  problem.  I've used SXM before with...
  no problem.  If anyone comes up with...
  an idea to check out on the board...
  please drop me an E-Mail.  Thanks. ga

(Sysop Tony) OK... ga David ga

(David) o.k....
  Before I ask...was there a specific topic for today...
  or is it more or less "ope"?  ga
  open?

(Sysop Tony) Open topics today... your pleasure.  ga

(David) thankee...
  I find myself in desperate need of a ...
  1200 baud modem rather than my old 300...
  for my 100 and 1000...
  does anyone have any recommendations or a favorite?  GA

(Sysop Tony) Yes...
  my advice is to get a Hayes compatible one...
  we have support programs for them here.  I use a Signalman.

(David) so... you would suggest a hayes or signalman over a tandy 1200?  GA

(Phil W) [yesss!]

(larry l) I just this week got the Travelcomm 1200 modem..
  It is an originate only 300/1200 unit that is not Hayes compatible...
  but it really seems to do the job.
  The deciding factor for me was that..
  the price was only $125....a special
  only during November...
  The company tells me they will be offering..
  a Hayes compatible unit for $200....ga
(Peter T.) Yes.  I have a QUBIE 300/1200 and love it....
  Completely Hayes compatable and cost $149 post paid. ga

(Phil W) Have a Hayes and have no problems.  Hayes compatible is a plus..
  because Denny Thomas' software QHAYES & XHAYES  for the M100..
  give excellent support. He is working on more general versions..
  but not guaranteed . ga

(Sysop Tony) David... I don't understand....
  Your questions suddenly turned from....
  I need a 1200 baud modem, to Should I get ...
  a modem or a Tandy 1200?  Which are you interested in?  ga

(David K) well, I was asking if the hayes would be better to use with both
  my 100 & 1000 as opposed to a 1200 baud tandy (modem)?  GA

(Sysop Tony) Oh, I see...

(Peter T.) Little confusion there...
  David thinks he can hook the Hayes...
  to the M100.  At any rate, my...
  QUBIE is external, with switches on
  the front.  ...
  That's all from me. ga

(David K) actually the 1200 baud would be for my 1000...
  if I could have it use w/the 100...
  well that's just icing on the cake...
  xtra gravy!  GA.

(Sysop Tony) Externals are used...
  with the RS-232 port, so can be used by any computer...
  so equipped.  OK for now, David?  ga

(David K) to summarise then...
  the hayes is THE one to buy, yes?  GA

(Sysop Tony) No, not a Hayes, they're over priced.  Get a Hayes Compatible.

(Phil W) For the PC world, Hayes is the one.  But they are overpriced. 
  Compatible IS important.. for the available PC software! ga

(David K) o.k... a hayes compatible... thankee...
  that'll do me fer now, tony   Thanx!  GA

(GENE NESTRO) ? Anyone have any luck...
  w/ 100 - 100 xfers w/ .CO files ga

(Sysop Tony) Well, as I understand it, you have to be "In" the file, or
  have it "loaded" to effect a direct transfer, something you can't do...
  with a CO file.   However, I understand X-Tel will do it for you.  ga
(GENE NESTRO) OK will try X-TEL.. I use BASIC to "save' & "load"...
  but will give xtel a try   thanx ga

(Phil W) As Tony suggests, x-tel (commercial, $50)...
  is the way to go.  But a less direct  way is using CHANGE.BA (DL4)..
  to make it into a hex file and to send that and reconvert on the other..
  end.  I did see a newletter from SF where they made a little BA..
  program that dumped a CO file from Hi RAM direct to the comm port..
  in hex and re-CO'd it on the receiving end.  Cute!  But not in..
  the public domain.  Would not be hard to do , tho.  ga

(GENE NESTRO) thankx, I use COM:98n1E,R for BASIC progs...
  and thought maybe somthing similiar could be used fo .CO ga

(Sysop Tony) OK...  Well, it's open forum time.
  Phil, re the Power-DOS problem: Have you tried any other programs that
  access disk with POWER-DOS?  Any similar problems?  ga

(Phil W) Well, I have done some fairly simle things with no problem, like...
  disassembling a m/l program and writing the file to a disk...
  directly from the dissassembler via 0:FILE.DO  spec.  Seems OK...
  except for the SPLCHK case.  Still need to try LFILESV though. ga

(Sysop Tony) Peter St. Clair discovered a flag in CDOS that told you when a
  disk was inserted or removed....
  If Power-DOS has a similar sensing flag, maybe that's a problem!  ga

(Phil W) I'm not changing disks at the time of the problem..
  since it is the first disk access in the program. ga

(Sysop Tony) Yeah....
  but the prompt says "Insert disk # 1, and press enter.... So, just wondering,
  although I see no test for disk swaps in the software.  ga

(Phil W) Nope!  [BTW --subject is apparent bug in POWR-DOS] ga

(Sysop Tony) Well, it'll be interesting to see...
  what Ed comes up with.  The program works with both the previous....
  DOS's.  TS-DOS and POWR-DISK.  I've not tried it....
  with Disk Power, though.  Don't like using software...
  where you have to cold start to remove it.  ga

(Phil W) Agree. there are some differences in P-DISK & P-DOS.  Like LFILESV with P-DISK...
  results in an immediate lowering of temp to absolute zero! ga

(Sysop Tony) OK...  Oh, I hate these slow CO's!

(Phil W) Oh... The Traveling Software CO should be a good one.  TS-RANDOM is...
  looking good. ga

(Sysop Tony) By "looking good", do you mean....
  you've actually seen it, or that's what they've told you?  ga

(Phil W) Beta testing. ga

(Sysop Tony) Oh!  Wonderful.  
  Well, then it really IS on the way to market.  ...
  Should be interesting, and should...
  generate some sort of database-type program for the TDD, real soon.  ga

(Phil W) Yes...  big plusses are file recovery (faster, easier than POWR-DOS)
  and real database management with TDD (comes with a sample program in...
  Basic which can be easily modified, since it is well-commented)...
  POWR-DOS still has some definite plusses, tho --like low RAM residence ga

(Sysop Tony) That's what I like to see... commented programs! ....
  Sounds like TS-RANDOM has taken a different tack than "Just another DOS"!
  And a different tack than Power-DOS, too.  Good!

(Phil W) There are good points and bad points. Won't comment..
  on bad ones since they may/can get fixed still.  Good stuff..
  will for sure stay.  Current version seems to be bug free (so far)...
  so should be shipping soon I would guess. ga

(Sysop Tony) OK....
  OK Fred, let's see what your question is....  ga Fred ga

(FRED GIRARD) Looking for info on swapping text files between trs-80 model 100
  or 200 ... and a kaypro-10, not with a null modem cable, but over fone line.

(Sysop Tony) Well Fred...
  there is lots of such info around....
  Have you checked out DL1, where such files are kept? ...
  and...  ga Phil ga

(Phil W) Say more about yur applicatin, Fred.  Remote?  Autoanswer? What? ga

(FRED GIRARD) Kay-10 will be up in auto-answer usually, but I'd like to go
  either way. I'm a reporter with The Detroit News, and a lot of ...
  our reporters use trs-80s in the field. ga.

(Phil W) FRed, some bulletin board software...
  would let you call in give passwords, etc -- if the KP is connected...
  to a phone line with autoanswer modem.  Sounds like what you need....
  Such software is available for KP's but does take a bit of work to ...
  set up.  Try the KAYPRO SIG (name??) or one of the many public KP ...
  RCP/M-RBBS systems to get a lead on software.  I'm sure there is one...
  in Detroit area. ga

(FRED GIRARD) thank you.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... You're up, Rick.  ga.

(RICK) THANKS
  MAYBE SOMONE CAN TELL ME IF I HAVE TO
  BUY A VIDEO DISK INTERFACE TO RUN A 
  MONITOR ON THE 100??

(Sysop Tony) Yes.

(RICK) CANT I JUST PROBE THE RS232 FOR A VIDEO SIGNAL?

(Sysop Tony) Rick... there is no video signal in the RS-232 port.

(RICK) WELL WHAT ABOUT THE DIP IN THE BOTTOM??

(Sysop Tony) There is no video signal in the computer anywhere!

(Phil W) Tony speaks with straight tongue!

(Sysop Tony) Any more questions, Rick?

(RICK) WHEN YOU PLUG IN THE DIP PLUG FOR THE VIDEO INTERFACE...
  WHAT HAPPENS TO THE LCD?

(Sysop Tony) 1. When you plug in the interface...
  it connects to the system buss, where it directly reads the address lines
  between the CPU and the LCD drivers. ....
  2.  The LCD and the CRT work together....  Your menu on the LCD,
  your text, data or programs on the CRT.  ga

(RICK) WELL WHAT DOES THE V.D.I REALY DO??

(Sysop Tony) It converts digital signals, arranged in 8-bit parallel...
  into ascii characters, displays them on a CRT screen....
  and keeps track of where the cursor should be.

  Done, Rick?

(RICK) yea thanks 

(Sysop Tony) Suggest you read the file CONFER.HLP in DL0, or DL8 as soon as
  possible... as it will help you in conferencing.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... on to Jim.  ga Jim ga

(JIM R) THANKS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO USE CHANGE.BA (DL4) TO CONVERT VIEW.HEX
  (VHEX)(DL1).  KEEP GETING ERROR 5 IN LINE 43.   SUGGESTIONS?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know....
  not familiar with the program, although I have seen....
  it's gone through several changes.  Perhaps Phil can help.  Phil?  ga

(Phil W) Usually, that means that there is a blank line or two in the front of
  the hex file.  First line should have the three addresses.  Any blank lines
  at beginning (from no-xmodem download) should be removed, as should
  any extra stuff at the end.

(JIM R) I'LL TRY THAT GA

(GENE NESTRO) Suggest checking Maxfiles...
  Maxfiles cannot = 0 for Change to work ga

(Sysop Tony) OK, Jim?  Any more questions on that?  ga

(Phil W) [but blank lines give EXACTLY that message!]

(GENE NESTRO) your rite Phil ga

(JIM R) THANKS FOR THE SUG

(Sysop Tony) Jim... just out of curiosity...
  did you check the manual to see what Error 5 was? ...
  in the back of the manual?  ga

(JIM R) FC ERROR GA

(Phil W) [no rhyme or reason]

(Sysop Tony) Well, then, that's probably it.

(Phil W) Jim... are you in uppercase mode or do you always see upper case
  no matter who types?  Some programs here will not work right if you do not
  have lower case enabled in your default settings

(JIM R) I HAVE UPPER CASE LOCKED

(Phil W) OH!! GOOD!

(JIM R) THANKS AGAIN

(Sysop Tony) OK...  Speaking Lineup = 0

(Sysop Tony) Well, OK, then....
  Let me mention there are going to be some software changes....
  coming up that will affect all the forums....
  as CompuServe makes it's periodic "enhancements".  There is...
  a file in DL0 called FORUM.TXT that outlines the coming changes.  Suggest...
  you all check it out, and leave any questions on the board for quick...
  answers.  OK?  

(Sysop Tony) And, if no one has any further topics for discussion...
  then if no more interest, we can close the CO for today.

  OK...  Conference ended at 9:25 AM Pacific time.
