 This file contains glimpses from some of the Sunday Chit-chat COnferences that 
were held Oct-Dec '84. Most of what has been preserved from 14 COs are bits of 
help and advice that are rather unchanging. Comments about hardware/software 
that has been going through many changes are not included.

(End User) [71256,1042] As I said in my bulletin message I'm on strike;
came on this a.m. cause CIS suspended me before strike date and wanted to
answer questions. Official poll results will be released through Portable 100
and directly to participants. However, I will answer some questions if..
you have them. Want to know how CO scored ?
(End User) Right, [results will be Emailed first part of] November. as to CO,
it faired poorly---out of 127 responses   65=no opinion (highest)
  A=5   B=18   C=20   D=11    F=8    Average=C   Most interesting was the
associated comments, those who were negative were very negative; comments
focused on the interruptions, lack of theme and lack of organization.
NO DIFFERENCE between LOW,MED,HIGH computer sophisticates.
(DaveW) [75775,202] Back to the poll What issue of P100 will the results be in?
(End User) Probably Dec January
(End User) In order to appreciate the C grade for CO consider the following:
       1 Value of SIG A
       2 Value of Software A
       3 Value to Non-Hackers B+
       4 SIG Management A-
These were the same individuals grading the same SIG, when they go out of their
way to make such a clear statement about the CO..and that statement is
consistent, and otherwise embedded in positive comments,
that someone ought to say Hmmph!

(STEVE W.) HOW DO YOU SEND A MODEL 100 TEXT FILE TO SUPERSCRIPSIT?
(Sysop Dave) Oh boy. First, what Model computer do you have other than 100?
(STEVE W.) YEAH, I KNOW YOU CAN TRANSFER CASSETTES, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PROTOCOL?
(STEVE W.) I HAVE A MOD 4
(Sysop Dave) Okay, there are several file transfer systems on the SIG.
just for the transfer -> Model III/4 and then there you are.
I've been using DISK+ from Portable Computer Support Group
which also allows mass storage of M-100 files on 4 disk.
gary, which is the best file in XA1 for Steve?
(gary kb) Sounds like FILTRN or something like it.
I don't have a copy of the index with me but that name is familiar.
Steve to use them you may need some Assembler knowlege.
(Sysop Dave) I'm looking right now. COMCMD.HEX in XA1 is one of best I am told.
(STEVE W.) OK THANKS. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE THE M100 DISK UNIT?
(KEN L.) Steve can also do it with the communications protocols of TRSDOS
and using the RS 232 port of the MOD 100.
(Sysop Dave) If you understand that stuff Steve, see the 19200.TXT file in XA4 
for a very fine discussion of xfer problems at 19200 buaud by our tekniko sysop 
larry gensch.  Refer any other questions to him on the SIG message board.  

 (phil p) Dave I am about to try to upload my first program as soon as I
 finish doc.  Do you want me to let you know first? 
 (Sysop Dave) Not necessary at all Phil. What IS necessary is your
 understanding of UPLOAD.HLP and all that pertains, have you read, marked, and
 inwardly digested that file?
  (phil p) Dave yes for several mo.  Also I have upload help.  Would it be
 better if I had XMODEM? 
 (Sysop Dave) Yes, if you want error free transfer and if you want to use
 multi-statement program lines that are over 132 characters the way Howard has
 his SMART.SIG etc.
 (phil p) I just made all lines less than 127. How about the Doc?
 (Sysop Dave) Okay, Couple of thoughts. Doc should be uploaded at 79 width for
 easy printer use by the most folks. You may UPL without xmodem perfectly okay,
 we've been doing it for over a year but please include checksum in description
 so that I can make sure I got what you think you sent.  Another problem is
 folks UPLoad the file from disk that they worked on last month instead of the
 file from RAM that really works.

  10:50:36 AM EDT Sunday, October 21, 1984
 (Sysop Dave) Since I am one of the few that saw SoundSight's Bubble Machine,
 let me make quick comment. Saw a prototype that had been in hands of user for
 about a month. SoundSight has told me that they are ready to show and ship. 
 We need to find someone in southern California to go there and snoop.
  rowlfe is in Hawaii for a month or so.  
(Tony A.) 1) Soundsight where in Calif?
 2) Re bubble: Who wants to spend a grand or more for it when Chipmunk = 360K?
(Sysop Dave)  1) LA area. See BUBBLE.PRD in XA6 for address;  2) Concur 100%.
(gary kb) bubbles super in hostile env; but agree on price (now).
(Sysop Dave) Explicate "hostile env".
(Tony A.) LA Smog!!!
(gary kb) something where the disk would not survive dust, heat, vapor, etc.

(Tony A.) Hate to carp, but what is the problem with Portable 100? They
 certainly give one no confidence in their ability to deliver the magazine,
 and undoubtedly lose many potential subscribers.
(Sysop Dave) Well, Peter said so much to me in confidence that I don't know what
to say in public. Let me repeat that P-100 is NOT going to fold in the next two
 years. Methinks that John is doing all he can.
 PERSONAL suggestion: send your complaints to Jim Povec the Publisher
 at the same address.

(phil) What is X9?
(Sysop Dave) X9 is the list of files that have been uploaded in the past seven
 days. Just enter X9 at the main Function prompt; have all of you graduated to
 "Command" mode so that you don't have to fool with menus? If not, use the OP
 command and investigate.

(rod b) is there a bsr home controller program for the m100 that anybody knows
 about?
(Tony A.) Larry G and I have been talking about that this past week on the msg
 board. The problem is finding the BSR controller that works on the RS232 port.
 SciTronics in Bethlehem PA used to make one, and advertised in Computer
 Shopper, but seem to have evaporated. Keep your eyes open for an RS232 BSR
 controller.

(JIM LEE   ) how do you use echo into memory, not printer?
(Sysop Dave) Doesn't work that way Jim, all you can do is put your 100
into download mode with the F-2 key, F-5 is for printer only.

10:58:46 AM EST Sunday, October 28, 1984
(Sysop Dave) Just fine you two! And are you both reading me in lower case?
(TIM) NOPE
(Sysop Dave) You should be if you are on any TRS-80 or fairly advanced
computer. You need to go to CIS-9 when you get a chance and set your
caps lock off and enable upper/loerwer case capability, understand Tim?
(TIM) YES I WILL THANKS
(Sysop Dave) Aside from shouting at us Tim, if you are planning to download
programs from this SIG, some won't run if you download them as you are
set up right now.
(Sysop Dave) Marshall, it is not necessary to type name and channel.
CompuServe does that for you. However, if you want to shorten your name
type /HAN in the left margin.

(Allan) Pls. refresh my memory on how to read an invisible file in
Public Access.
(Sysop Dave) Okay, you MUST know the filename and the PPN of the uploader
then R FILE.EXT[70000,000] and there must be NO space between filename
and the bracket for PPN.

11:06:38 AM EST Sunday, November 4, 1984
(KEN  ) WHAT IS THE M AND B FILES?
(Sysop Dave) Okay, just noticed we have a LOT of newcomers here.
Listen up Kiddies!!!
The "MI" file is the essential starting place as you were advised on arrival at
the SIG. When you CTRL-C out of the CO area you will be at the necessary prompt
to issue the MI command. Type MI up there at the Main Function menu prompt and
when you hit ENTER it will immediately be transmitted to you.
The "B" and "X0" files are obtained in the same manner at the same place.

(Maddi) What is Channel 1; how do I get there; How do I ask someone to TALK?
(Sysop Dave) ... you are in Channel 30 right now; to change channels you use
the /tun command. Mark is not there, but he wanted you to /tun 1. Understand?
(Maddi) Yes. How do I ask a job # to go to TALK?
(Sysop Dave) With the job # known, use /TALK # and that is that.

(Margie) Yes. I need a text formatter with auto page numbering. I've been using
TextPower 100 but numbering is awkward.
(Sysop Dave) Try PRINTR.100 from DL0; commercially I like the flexibiity of
WRITE+ which is now sold in Radio Shack as SCRIPSIT 100.
SCRIPSIT is about 5K methinks with its total of three files.

11:00:05 AM EST Sunday, November 11, 1984
(Rob) What does PACKER.100 do?
(TONY M) Is Minivc.wm3 "packed"?
(Sysop Dave) MINIVC is indeed packed. You can tell by lack of spaces between
 statements et cetera....and it would not be possible to pack any way! too big!
(Sysop Dave) Rob, PACKER compresses programs in DO format so they take up less
 space in both TEXT and BASIC.

(Bates) Found out lst week that direct connect won't work on hotel phone with
  message light ,,any suggestions?
(Sysop Dave) Have you seen CLIPS.HLP in XA4???
(Bates) Have seen...have you tried it?
(Sysop Dave) Nope, no need.
(Bates) I'll have to get parts and try.
(Sysop Dave) Oops! Wait Bates! Yes! Used it in Michael Lampert's office!
(Bates) Did clips stay on connectors easily?
(jim  ) Have had good luck with CLIPS. Can't auto-dial tho.
(Sysop Dave) Yes. But I have no real idea about it. T'was &mike&'s lashup.

(Sysop Dave) I'll try to be brief...
What are the appropriate topics for exchange on the message board?
Is it a wide open forum? Is ANY topic of interest to a person with a Model 100
suitable for long message exchange or for many short message exchanges. ?????
That is: Do we stick to Model 100 related topics or do we get into how to bake
french bread if that is what interests us and we have a Model 100??????
(jim  ) is this a real prob? & what do other SIG Sysops do?
(Sysop Dave) Don't see it as a REAL problem but some folks have had their
feelings upset by my asking them to take their discussion to Email.
(jim  ) gotta think about it some .....
(=Norm=) As the question came up, I had thought that this was a M100 board, so
why would we want to bake french bread, but then, since the 100 is so
versatile, a brief excurssion could be in order.  Until it gets where the
boundaries of common courtesy are exceeded, or too far afield.  I see no
reason for some other topics, but do see SIG etiquette as a..
problem from time to time.
(Sysop Dave) Yes, and space for messages too. Thanksgiving will be my first
anniversary as sysop and I think I've only asked about six folks to drop the
subject.
(Bates) Should be largely memb and SYSOP judgement. We/U should speak up when
out of bounds. I especially hate "yep,nope,thanks".
(Sysop Dave) Definition of "out of bounds" is part of problem.
11:40:29 AM EST Sunday, November 11, 1984
(DaveW.) I don't feel that m100 unrelated questions or comments should use up
much disk space reserved for messages thus dumping of the related threads.
However a message addressed to All might be allowable to get the most interest
and then switch to Email for remaining comments. Whatcha think Dave?
(Sysop Dave) That is along the line I have been operating but wanted to know
what some of the interested members thought the policy should be.
Okay, any further thoughts on the subject welcome here or on message board.
Q or C for anything except french bread!!!!

(DaveW.) Jim, as far as I know the only way to convert .do to .ba without
ending with two files is to Save the .DO file to Cassette then kill the .DO
file and then in Basic Load the .DO file thus forming a .BA file.
(jim  ) Is there a short EMAIL help file somewhere?
(Sysop Dave) Nope, best I can suggest is to buy the excellent....
How to Get the Most Out of CompuServe by Peyton and Bowen from Bantam Books
that is now available in most good bookstores. Then, you could also use the ?
command to get help in the Email section of CIS.

11:01:34 AM EST Sunday, November 18, 1984
(Eiji M) Are there any alternatives for R/S' acoustic cups...
when direct connect is not possible?
(Sysop Dave) Yes, there is a product called Blackjack....
and &mike& can tell you about CLIPS.
(&mike&) See clips.hlp in xa4. I'm using them now and generally believe their
wonderful ($3.00 in parts and a little soldering *BUT* for the first time on a
trip last week I ran into 2 hotels in a row where phone was so funny they
wouldn't work. Needed to buy extra set of cups. Also, no go pay phones for
clips or blackjack mouthpiece cover welded in place.

(DaveW.) Once your in TALK mode how do you get back to the CO?
(Sysop Dave) [Paul, CONFER.HLP in XA8 is handy guide.]
(Sysop Dave) Use the CTRL-P, and you are even told that when you get to the
back room. Dave, CTRL-C will take you to SIG without stopping in the
conference rooom on the way.

(Chas.D) besides Portable 100 which seems to be a standard,
 any other mags recommended?
(Sysop Dave) 80-micro of Dec '83 has memory map and ROM addresses....
 PCM magazine has some good stuff and is one-half the Model 100
 Other than those two, know of nothing. Recommend you grab Lien's book from
 Radio Shack and get the Waite Groups set of five before you go. They are $90
 but worth it in your circumstances.

(Mike D.) Anyone have any experience with the 32K expansion module...
from PG Elec??
(Chas.D) indirect, C. Davey Utter has put together 2 group buys and likes it
(Mike D.) Should I buy?
(Sysop Dave) I don't think anybody can advise you as to whether you should
 buy or not, only you know your neeeds and $$$ available....
 but a lot of folks are very pleased with it, including Ed Juge.
 Some of them bombed, but Peter made immediate replacement, very good product
 support from that youngster.
(rowlfe) it is even better than you think, us that got in on the 2nd buy...
 can get our units upgraded to the 3rd generation for the price of shipping!
 however, Mike, it does have drawbacks as well as good points.
 at present u can only use one  bank at a time.
 peter is still working on that and I hope to get info from dave utter.
 Another...since it uses the 40 pin port in the back...
 you can't use the rom plug, however, peter is working on THAT too.
(Mike D.) Rowlfe, basically, how does the 100 know where to store a file
 with this extra module, is there a 'toggle' for the two RAM banks? 
(rowlfe) Mike, it is simple there is as you put it a software toggle...
 to switch from bank to bank, the drawback I referred to is that you can't...
 have both banks talk to each other - program in one, and data in the other...
 you have to stay in one side at a time, however, PG says they will fix that
 pretty soon or so they say. does this answer the q?
(Mike D.) One more point. Does the 'firmware' (telcom etc)...
 that comes with the 100 work both banks?
(rowlfe) yes.  it initially looks like you had a sort of cold start, but that
 there are a few files peter put in there before he shipped it, it looks on the
 menu like a cold start anyway. but it is just the switch to a clean
 slate of memory.

(Sysop Dave) "ga" means "go ahead" to indicate a person is finished talking.
 You need to begin at the beginning, when you leave here with the CTRL-C....
 you will be at the Function menu prompt; from that prompt, type the command X0
 and hit ENTER. Never use the quotation marks in giving a command on CompuServe.
 When we say type "R DOWNLD.HLP" we mean without the "  got it Pat?
 Note that X0 will tell you how to go to XA0 to get files.....

11:00:06 AM EST Sunday, November 25, 1984
(&mike&) This is an I told you so c. Any word on EU survey results?
 Also, why'd ^dave ^ consent to EU w/drawing files?
(Sysop Dave) Sysop Dummy consented because I trusted him to return them when
 "strike" was over. Peter has read, but not answered, Private and public
 messages from me. Should have known better than to trust a lawyer..tee hee....

(Jim E.) With EU gone, what's the best, short renumber prog?
(Sysop Dave) The only one we have Jim, RENUM.100 in XA4 has some flaws that
 EU's does not but it works okay except for some strange syntaxes not normally
 used, such as ELSEGOTO or sum such...

11:12:32 AM EST Sunday, December 2, 1984
(Rob E.) Why was the SIG "temporarily unavailible 5 min. ago?
(Sysop Dave) That means that they are doing some howse keeping chores
 nothing to get excited about. Happens all the time, I was able to get their
 time moved from when they were doing it at about 13:00 before.

10:58:33 AM EST Sunday, December 30, 1984
(Jim E) I may have missed any responses I may have had about MiniVC locking up
 on a 24K 100. Is this normal??
(Sysop .^Dave^) Don't know, but why not start all over with SPREAD.WM3 which
 just has been up about four days. BE VERY SURE to get the documentation!!!!

(Jim E) Thanks dave also can you recomend a good checkbook program?
(Sysop .^Dave^) Try for HOMEXP in the DL5 area.

(<LYNN Z>) The other day I had to communicate with my M100 and Model III over
 the phone lines during the use, I found that no line feeds were transmitted.
 MIII uses Videotex Plus.  How can I correct?
(Sysop .^Dave^) If you mean in chit chat like this you have to use CTRL-J
 and be in half-duplex, has no effect on uploading or downloading files.
(<LYNN Z>) Each line transmitted would have to have a CTRL J attached?
(.^Dave^) That is correct for use from the keyboard is that what you mean?
(<LYNN Z>) Yes. thanks.
