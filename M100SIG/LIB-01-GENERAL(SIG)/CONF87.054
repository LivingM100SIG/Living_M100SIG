(Larry L) mornin'

(DAVID E) morning larry

(Larry L) Hi Dave..what's shakin'?

(DAVID E) Oh not much, Im confined to bed for a few days

(Larry L) Sorry  At least you have your M100 to keep you company..and CIS

(DAVID E) It's alright I am getting alot of reading and studies done.

(Larry L) Hi Tony

(DAVID E) Yes I dread the next bill

(Larry L) Damn the phone bills...full speed ahead.

(Sysop Tony) Larry must work for TPC.

(Larry L) Nope...just reconciled myself.

(DAVID E) My girlfriend is a lot of help also.

(Larry L) He He He

(DAVID E) <grin>

(Sysop Tony) Well, shall we get started?

(Larry L) sho nuf

(DAVID E) Have found your slides yet

(Sysop Tony) No, but I have a new set. (grin)

(Larry L) It's just the 3 of us

(Sysop Tony) True, but that's a start.

(Larry L) what are these slides I keep hearing about?

(Sysop Tony) When things slow down, I hold up my slides and describe them to
  you.

(Larry L) At $6 an hour?

(Sysop Tony) Lemmee see.... where'd I put them, now????

(Sysop Denny) (Are things slow, Tony?)

(Sysop Tony) OK...  Let me ask the question...  What equipment combination are
  you using,  and what would you like to buy to expand your system?  (yes)

(DAVID E) Well, I have a m100 and tdd1.  I am getting a sardine and plan to
  soon get a chipmunk.

(Larry L) Let's see...M100 ,PCSG RAM (96K)/with RAM +, and Super ROM  What I
  would like is a couple of Meg of RAM...with battery of course.

(Sysop Tony) Wouldn't we all!

(DAVID E) <dreamer>

(Sysop Tony) It occurred to me last night that Laptop User magazine has
  compiled a considerable database of equipment being used by it's various
  subscribers.  I was wondering if we shouldn't do something similar and put
  a file in the DL's somewhere so that when someone has a problem with a
  particular combination of equipment, he can look up someone who is using
  the same (or similar) combination and message that person for advice.  Any
  comments?

(R Caley) Good idea, Tony..but the person would have to know also what
  types of applications are being run and especially about CO files such as
  TMPC, MENUTL, and so on.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that would be assumed.  I'm just wondering if such a file
  would be useful.  Folks _could_ have done that with the member directory
  but they didn't.  If you've ever looked there as I did recently, it's full
  of much irrelevant stuff.  CompuServe urges folks to list their interests,
  and members do.  But it's hardly ever used that way.  I mean, who goes
  through that list looking for folks who like to fly Chinese kites?

(R Caley) I think your idea is a good one!  But I mentioned that other stuff 
  because I have learned NEVER to ASSUME anything!

(Sysop Tony) Or make generalizations.  Like that one!  (grin)  ga Denny

(Sysop Denny) Well, if we did a file like that, we would be able to use a
  lot more space than is available in the member directory and what LU asked
  for was your equipment *and* software.  If we could get people to participate
  it would be useful. (to us anyway!)

(Sysop Tony) It's unfortunate that CompuServe has no online database search
  capability.  If for example, we had a file listing members, their equipment,
  software, etc.  which could be searched, it would be boo-coo useful.  We
  might be able to open up DL14, and have members who wanted to participate in
  online support write up a short file, including the main things they can
  support in the file keywords, with details in a short file.  ga Larry

(Larry L) ok  Just wondering.  How many members M100SIG has and how many
  active users?

(Sysop Tony) There is no clear definition of that, especially since folks can
  sign on once, and are listed in the membership roster, but may have just
  been looking around and never come back for a second visit.  We have been
  guessing that there are about 300 "active" members, who could be
  considered the "hard core" of the forum, who come by regularly, leave
  messages, participate in conferences... etc.

(Larry L) thanks..

(R Caley) I like Laptop User!

(Larry L) [me too]

(Sysop Tony) So do I.  But delivery is slow, slow, slow!  ga Paul

(Paul) What's the topic for this meeting?

(Sysop {g}ony) Open Topics today - your choice.

(Paul) I am just observing

(Sysop Tony) OK... about my new slides.

(Paul) Has anyone used }ithat portable thermal printer?

(Sysop Tony) Which one?

(R Caley) If he means~r TTX Press,  I've had 2 of them and find them [ERY
  functional. Have had no problems whatsoever except youve got to watch the
  paper feed at the end of the roll... sometimes it gets twisted otherwise, no
  complaint!

(Larry L) I was immediately struck by the HIGH noise level of the printhead.
  Also..since it prints in one direction only it's SLOW.

(Paul) I don't know the make only it's distributed by purple computing. I
  think Since it's a thermial printer, how well the copies copy (xerox)?
  will it look like a dot matrix copy?

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, that's a TTX.   I thought they discontinued that printer
  over a year ago, but apparently there are still lots of them available.

(R Caley) comment to Larry, first  If I was looking for speed, I wouldn't
  choose a thermal printer. I like it for its portabilitg and ease of use to
  Paul...The copies are FINE....however It's kind of a pain to Xerox a rolled
  up piece of thermal paper I use it for downloading text files, EMAIL, notes
  to relatives, etc

(Sysop Tony) Phrankly, Phil has got the neatest thermal printer I've ever
  seen.  A NEC portable battery operated mini.

(Larry L) Yes ..for $99 it's c
a great buy(almost disposable).  But I have
  seen several fast thermals..3M used to make one and it was silent.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Any more on the subject of Thermal printers, Paul?

(Paul) Thanks, can sheet thermal paper be used?  I usally go to a radio shack
  and borrow the use of a printer when I'm on the road.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, you can use sheet paper  but it's relatively expensive.
  Either 3 cents or 5 cents a sheet... can't remember. OK... any more on that
  subject, Paul?

(Paul) no

(Sysop Tony) OK.... then David was next.  ga David

(DAVID E) Ok  Has Pico gone down now. I have not seen a new issue at my B.
  dalton store.

(Sysop Tony) No.  Pico is active.  but may not be available at the
  Walden/Dalton bookstores.  They are very sporatic in what they purchase for
  the magazine rack. If an issue doesn't sell out, they reduce the size of the
  next order.

(DAVID E) I work there and it just never came,  I also had a subsription and
  that didn't always come either.

(Sysop Tony) Well, I think the latest issue is the May issue.  At least that's
  the one I see sitting here on the desk.

(DAVID E) <april in store>

(Sysop Tony) Contact Marlene Butland at Pico  (603) 924-7949.  She's the
  circulation manager and might be able to answer both your questions.
  They're VERY helpful since they changed hands.

(DAVID E) Ok thanks.

(Gerry J. Elman) We just won a 1200 baud modem at a gathering of BBS users.
  Yay! Now I'd like to find some software to hook it to our M100's so
  we can still use the adrs.do file.  P.S. I also use DVI.

(Sysop Tony) Welcome to the "fast lane"!  (grin)  Denny, what would you
  recommend for Gerry?  ga Denny  Ooops, Denny's done dropped off line.  Well,
  let me see...  Is the modem Hayes
  compatible?

(Gerry J. Elman) Yes.  It's a Popcom 1200.

(Sysop Tony) OK... next question.  Are you using X-Tel or a Chipmunk?

(Gerry J. Elman)  no.  We've got a disk-video interface.  32 k plain vanilla
  M100.  Have used SXM software with it, created D-VI files fine.


(Sysop Tony) OK, Q-HAYES.100 in DL3 will connect you to the modem at 1200 baud,
  but won't allow you to download to disk.  XMDM25.100 in DL3 will both
  connect you, and allow download to disk, and Xmodem protocol.  So I'd guess
  XMDM25 is the best choice.  I've been beta testing a more advanced version,
  and it seems to work very well, and can be modified for special applications
  easily.  Author Leonard Erickson has provided much support in commented and
  cross referenced files.

(Gerry J. Elman) Thanks.  I'll take a look at the DL3 and down load a copy.
  Sounds like just what we need.  Appreciate the help, as usual.

(Sysop Tony) OK... that's what we're here for.

(Dennis E.) is there a way to do square roots on the 102

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm...  Lemmee think on that a minute.  Yes, There is a command
  in BASIC which returns the square root.  Use the following form: X = SQR(Z)
  ..... that should do it.

(Dennis E.) what i need to do is get the root of a y axis varible to generate
  a parabolic curve.  i'll try the command thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... book says it works only with positive numbers.  If that's
  a consideration, i.e. if you have negative numbers you'll have to convert
  them to positive with an ABS statement, then change the answer accordingly,
  I guess.   Phil is the math wiz around here but seems to be}i}i asleep this
  morning.

(Dennis E.){_ postive numbers are fine i only need the values in the first
  quadrant thanks

(Sysop Tony) OK... that's past my math skills to begin with.  So if you have
  any further questions, perhaps a message to Phil on the board would help.
  Oh, Denny's back.

(Sysop Denny) [Yes, back]

(Dennis E.) ok i'll try and write a{routine this week if it doesn't work i'll
  pester phil

(Sysop Tony) We've been losing folks right and left this morning.  Phil's
  asleep.

(Sysop Denny) [watching Indy 500]

(Dennis E.) uploading coffee to mister phil

(Phil W) here now!

(Sysop Tony) Ah, good morning, Phil.

(Phil W) what was the question?

(Sysop Tony) Had to do with figuring the square root of the first quadrant  or
  something.  (grin)

(Phil W) I scanned back, but a line was missing or sumpin'

(Dennis E.) phil, i need to generate a parabolic curve, and need to know how to
  do sq. roots of the product of the y axis.

(Phil W) well -- that is a bit confusing; how about y=ax^2+b?

(Dennis E.) well the eq i have used before is  sq. root of 4* focus * y.  this
  is for a reflector for a solar collector.

(Phil W) That's problably just the inverse of the one I gave.  you need to get
  + and - sqrt and if it is imaginary (sqrt of negative number) there is no
  real solution of the value of y you have picked

(}iDennis E.) all values can be postive

(Phil W) what you need is a quadratic solv;~er: a*x^2+b*x+c --->

(Dennis E.) i only need to plot in the first quadrant

(Phil W) x= -b +- sqr(b^2-4*a*c).  [put =0 for the first eqn]

(Dennis E.) what variable would be the focal point?

(Phil W) got me .. not a rememberer of geometry stuff. but leave me a message
  with the particualrs and I will bring out the giant set of reference books!
  (grin)

(Dennis E.) hahahaha thanks

(Sysop Tony) Is that it?  Such a simple solution???  (grin)
  Well.... guess it's back to the old grind.  ga Phil

(Phil W) Must be a quadratic solver here, somewhere -- yes?

(Sysop Tony) Swish!

  That was the sound of it all flying over my head.  ga Dennis

(Sysop Tony) (I have trouble cancelling powers!  (grin))

(Dennis E.) there is a prgm which makes the 100 simulate an hp calcutor that
  should solve qudratics

(Sysop Tony) Yeah.... there's still one in the DL's.  We had to remove two, I
  think, due to problems with the programs.  HPCALC was one of them. But
  there's still a program in DL4 that works.  Don't remember the name, though.

(Phil W) seriously, solutionn is easy -- but i never remember a focus from a
  thaumaturge!

(Sysop Tony) Well, I DO remember what a Googol is. ...

(Phil W) [or was that an apex?]

(Sysop Tony) Just have trouble writing it out.

(Sysop Denny) There are a lot of programs in DL4 that are named GRAPH. I know
  one of them will graph a parabolic curve.

(Dennis E.) well if push comes to shove i just use my tandy ec 4002 just get
  tired of hitting run @ time and write the result down. denny i tried one...
  forget which but i didn't work out.

(Phil W) Dennis -- leave me a message with the question and I will answer!

(Dennis E.) ok phil

(Phil W) [just found the CRC Handbook --SAVED!]

(Sysop Tony) Well, lemmee see.... my first slide...

(Phil W) wanna know about the "semi-latus rectum"?

(Sysop Tony) hmmmm... is upside down.

  Not really!

(Sysop Denny) please, not before lunch!

(Dennis E.) hahahah ROLF  tony, another q for phil of a diffrent nature ...

(Sysop Tony) Well, ga.

(Dennis E.) phil i noticed you have an intrest in robtics

(Sysop Tony) [What?]

(Dennis E.) is that a professional interest?

(Phil W) yes.

(Dennis E.) i program cnc and am considering getting into robotics for a
  living. any recomendations on what to read or schools offering a curiculum

(Phil W) Lots  to read; Stanford and Carnegie-Mellon and Ohio State are
  leading schools.

(Dennis E.) yeah, figured i would have to leave the state for schooling.
  i hear that the city of San Antoinio is offering something in that line
  drop me a list of book when u get the chance if u would please

(Phil W) I believe U of T has a curriculum in Robotics.  IN fact, it is the
  gee-whiz thing now, and most schools have a program.  Main discriminators
  would be at graduate level.

(Dennis E.) how much different is a robtic pgrm from a 3 or 4 axis machining
  center pgrm???

(Phil W) Gotta translate the latter for me.

(Dennis E.) ok  ah lets see  i write programs for cnc mills and lathes and i
  was woundering if there are simularities with those to robotic programs?

(Phil W) Well, don't have much knowledge of them.  Problably the algorithms
  are very different.  But at the coding level, a good programmer could
  probably +++b

(Sysop Denny) Phil got dumped.  That was his modem signing off.

(Sysop Tony) Huh!  Interesting. .... He must have accidently hit a signoff
  macro key.  Gee, it's neat to have a modem Xpurt around.  (grin)  Well,
  let's move on.  Anyone?

(Dennis E.) i use to have the call waiting plague until i found out about 1170

(Phil W) hi -- hit the wrong key and went bye-bye.

(Sysop Tony) The call waiting "plague"???  Good choice of words.  by the
  way, carl Oppedahl has just published a new book ...

(Sysop Denny) Nice to see you back Phil!

(Sysop Tony) detailing the inner workings of the telephone system and legal
  remedies, and inside info on how TPC works.  From what I've read, it's a
  very good book. You guys want to continue that robotic programming
  discussion?

(Sysop Denny) I thought you knew everything about Phones!

(Phil W) Can't now, I'm afraid. Must go save the National Space Program. (grin)

(Sysop Tony) Well, actually, more than most.  I worked for them once.  But
  Carl's approach is from the legal standpoint what they're required to do,
  and what you can do about it when they don't.  Plus lots of general info on
  how the system works

(Bill H.) [Phil are you in Torrance Ca.?]

(Phil W) [Tony takes  a more illegal approach?]  [yes, Bill]

(Sysop Tony) Lots of good insider info.   Well, does anyone have any comments,
  questions or topics to cover in the last 15 minutes this morning?

(Fyll) me

(Bill H.) [Phil, if I leave my phone no. in your mail box will you give me a
  call in about 45 min. I'm in L.A.]

(Fyll) [In fact, may not have a phone near me then; but I will try -- do it
  NOW]

(Bill H.) 10-4   bye for a few.

(Sysop Tony) Well, if nothing else, we can close the CO for this week,  saving
  you folks some connect charges.

(Dennis E.) bye all have a good week

(Sysop Tony) OK?

(Fyll) [settle for a good day!]

(Sysop Tony) Let's see.... which macro is it now ...

(Sysop Denny) 13!

(Fyll) [show off!]

(Sysop Tony) Pho}ioey!  ****  END OF  CONFERNCE ****  Enjoy the holiday folks.
  This Co has degenerated into a morass of nothingness.  Phil.... describe to
  me the properties of a black hole.  Or is that black whole?  [In 25 words or
  less!] (grin)

(Sysop Denny) Phil isn't here, but that's one of my favorite subjects.  I
  think you were refering to the theory of entropy. ... "given time, all
  systems revert to confusion"

(Sysop Tony) Well, I guess we should schedule a CO to discuss  Life, the
  Universe and Everything. ....  I know.... "42"!

(Sysop Denny) 42?

(Sysop Tony) Yep, 42.
  Bill - Phil needs your phone number.

(Bill Heiman) I left it in his mail box  it should get there in about 20
  minutes.

(Sysop Tony) OK, he probably went to check.

(Sysop Denny) Sometimes it gets there faster.

(Sysop Tony)  It would have been easier for you to send it direct.  with the
  /SEN command.  

(Bill Heiman) yes I remember now

(Sysop Tony) He said something about having to go to work.

(Bill Heiman) opps... too late  hes gone

(Sysop Tony) No, he's back.  ga Phil

(Phil W) Bill do the following   /sen 31 xxx-xxxx

(Sysop Tony) Denny, "42" is from the book series, "Hitchhikers Guide to the
  Galaxy", and is the ultimate answer to the question of Life, the universe,
  and Everything.  It's a catch phrase on lots of college campuses. (campii?)

(Sysop Denny) Ah Ford Prefect!

(Sysop Tony) Yes!   Did you catch the TV series?  Or the Radio series on NPR?

(Sysop Denny) no, a guy at work is a FP fanatic. Haven't read the book.

(Phil W) Bill -- get off so I can call  you -- busy signal

(Bill Heiman) ok I'm signing off to release the line

(Sysop Tony) Books, Denny, Books.  Five in the Series.  The last one has the
  most interesting title "Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish!"

(Sysop Denny) I should try to read them, but I don't even have time for a few
  mags.

(Sysop Tony) I know what you mean!  I get magazines and it's weeks before I
  get to them.

(Sysop Denny) my friend was on a BBS doing a role playing story, and he was
  using Ford as his character. good wit.

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  Lots of clever ideas in the books, and of course the
  videos are quite visual.  Very original stuff, and I generally don't get too
  involved in Sci-Fi.
