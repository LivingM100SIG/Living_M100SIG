(Dennis Smith) NEWS OF RECHARGE FOR 200 STORE SAYS FORGET IT
 ANY WORD ON HOW LONG ON A CHARGE?
(Sysop Tony) If'n you mean can you use rechargeable batteries in a Tandy 200,
 Yes.  See the file RECHRG.200 in DL4. It's aa simple modification, and nicads
 will give you 4 to 6 hours of use between charges, depending on exactly how
 you use the computer.
(Dennis Smith) THanks, store said 2, 4 - 6 looks good -0-


(John M) What has happened to Portable 100 Magazine?  The last issue that
 I have received was the July issue.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See message 129776 for the former Editor's comments. RI129776.
  In a nutshell, never were reliable and are just continuing to be more
  reliably unreliable.
(John M) Thanks, I'll read the comments. Too bad, It's not a bad publication;
 however, PCM is carrying many laptop articles and advertisements.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup, we shall see what develops.


(Sysop Tony) Picked up a copy of 80-Micro based on a message on the board, and
 am really excited!!!  article describes how to build a second RS-232 port
 that works off the system bus!  The author intended it to allow him to use the
 Model 100 as a modem for a second computer but it can also be used to allow
 download to the TDD disk exactly like the Chipmunk works!!!  The article
 includes a basic, BASIC program, which also give the technique to communicate
 with the disk drive, but user will need one of the alternate DOS's to do it.
 Great advance!!!  Sept issue of 80 Micro, page 52!
 Pick one up quick, October issue may be out soon.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Now all we (you) have to do is get that all together in an
  article here that doesn't violate copyright laws!!
(Sysop Tony) I hear you!
(PhilW) Does it fit inside the M100 or in an external box? And does it ID the
 connector for the bus?
(Sysop Tony) External box.... and the article gives the source for a buss
 connector, and ribbon cable.
(PhilW) Hmmm; well I guess with my PGD RAM I would need a differnt one.  But it
 should be a neat project.
(MACY) I HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE WITH 1 rs232c ...
(Sysop Tony) If your RAM has the new connector, the adapter cable from
 PG Designs for the Chipmunk should work fine.


(MACY) Why does it sometime fail at 9600 baud when I have it cabled to my XT
 but will (at those times) work ok if I slow to 300?
(PhilW) Well, that is a pretty general question, Macy.  What xt software is
 involved?
(MACY) CrossTalk XVI ver 3.5 
(PhilW) I (of course) recommend getting FLTIBM.DOC (DL1) and going from there.
(MACY) I'd hate to have to use a different package for each thing I do.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Macy, most of us have found that software dedicated to fast
  file transfer is preferable to a standard communications package. FLTIBM
  program takes up zilch space and is used just for transfers.
  Recommend you at least read the documentation.
(MACY) Ok. Ok. I'll go get it, despite what I just said. Thanks.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Consistently hear of folks having problems with CrossTalk.
(PhilW) the problem with using xtalk, mite, qmodem, pc-talk etc for such a
 simple task is that the set-up must be just right on the pc end.
 FLTIBM has only one set up and is 1200 bytes long, and does just one thing
(MACY) Ok. & I can put it on disk when not in use so ...
 Has anyone had known troubles at high speed with PROCOMM?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) For that, you'd have to ask over on TRS80PRO unless you mean
  for 100 file transfer. Don't know of anybody doing it.
(PhilW) [procomm is another pc-talk for pc]
(MACY) Do you imply that the problem is at the M100 end?
(PhilW) I have used it but all the same comments re set-up apply. No problems
 seen if pc set up is correct.  Problem is seldom at the M100 end.
(MACY) What sort of problem is intermittent at the pc end?
 After all, I'm running scripts?
(PhilW) well, scripts should have nothing to do with transfering via rs-232
 to a Model 100 which is what I thought you wanted to do. Final word is try
 FLTIBM, AND leave me a message if that does not do it for you. 
(MACY) Pardon me ... FROM the M100 to XT with an Answer script on the IBM.
 Yes. Yes. I will. Thanks.


(Rich L) I saw the write up on Dave in the OMLINE TODAY...it's neat.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And Mortimer is still whimpering because we haven't received
  our copies as yet. Thanks for the kind words Rich.


(RossR) Question is: Has anyone figured out how (on 600) to call one of the
 system programs (ie Word) from Basic and then have cntrol return to Basic when
 done using the System once Basic is reselected. But you have to do that
 manually from System Menu
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ross, so far the only application that can be called from
  Basic is FILE using the DBCALLS.LIB. Methinks that what you want CAN be done
  if/when the right person rewrites DBCALLS.LIB the way UTILITY.LIB in DL 4 was
  created. Other than that, we are out of luck. Methinks.


(GENE NESTRO) I have the opportunity to pick up some CGP-115 printers for $15
 to $20 & woukd like to use them as portables; color doesn't matter.
 Does anyone think they will do it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not a hardware hacker myself so I don't know how you would set
  up the battery power. I used the 115 for the first four months of my
  Model 100 printing.
(rowlfe) [what is a cgp-115?]
   [115 = small printer, uses ball point pens as print head.]
(Rich L) thanks...a user here in Atlanta has been using a 115 for over a year
 with 5 NiCads mounted inside.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gene, sounds as though Rich may be able to get the info you
  need!!
(PhilW) my only problems have been with the pens drying up. Bill Templeton
 has done some NEAT plotting things with his.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sometimes running very hot water over the pens will undry them
(RossR) Used a CGP115 for first year also. Has TREMENDOUS POWER if used with
 BASIC for Plotting etc. But only has 40 column mode for TEXT.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Has 80 column for TEXT also, but is very wee.
(Rich L) ok...Gene..you might write this down. this is the part number for the
 small gears that have been know to split: ARA 0564.
 they are .50 a piece from r/shack...


(pablo Orsolani) Two quick ones: 1.- what is Checksum?
  2.- what is xmodem mode of uploading?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The checksum, as used on this SIG, is a means of confirming
  that the file received is the same one as was sent; the number is obtained by
  running the program DOWNCK.WM3 from the DL 4 database. It examines a TEXT
  file form of the program not the Basic format.
  See XMODEM.HLP in DL 0 for the rationale on using XMODEM which is an error
  checking form of file transfer. Best available for the Model 100 family.


(Terry G.) By the by, good article in ONLINE and a great picture of Mortimer.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Thanks, we haven't seen it yet. {whimper}]
(Terry G.) I have question concerning print drivers. I am using a program from
 R/S called Business Graph, it has print drivers for 8 printers - all R/S
 specific. The only problem is I have a CITOH ProWriter Jr. using Epson FX-80
 codes. I have called TX software support and that was no help.
 any suggestions?
(PhilW) If it is a Basic program, it should be easy to patch (given the
 program!) but if m/l no good ideas at all. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Terry, isn't that Graph program Basic??
(Terry G.) That's right, it uses all basic code for the print drivers to set
 up graph portion of program
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks a comparison of the programs Manual with the similar
  codes for your printer might come up with the correct patching.
(PhilW) I suggest leaving a message to ALL on the SIG.  Someone has probably
 already done this job and can advise.  Bill Templeton is a likely candidate.


(rowlfe) after being gone for 6 months, I scanned the boards last night and saw
 a reference to a '102'.  what is that???
(Rich L) snicker
(PhilW) [boy, he HAS  been gon!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is the number one hundred with a two added thereto.
(rowlfe) [ok, so it is a dumb q, I know!]
(PhilW) [Dave can add!]
 The 102 is the new 100, Rowlfe.  It is smaller (thinner), has some ROM
 differences and etc.  See some files in DL4 (help Dave!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See 102.INF in DL 6, 102.DIF and 102DIF.INF in DL 4.
  Rowlfe, the MAJOR change is the move in the buss connector. It is beside the
  RS-232 port instead of on the bottom.
(PhilW) [font on screen has been improved to be less readable, too]


(rowlfe) does the ms-dos type machines have a generic comm program such as
 PIP.COM used under cp/m?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope.
(PhilW) COPY.COM will do some of the things PIP will do.  But it is not as
 useful for transferring between machines as PIP.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rowlfe, you DO know the main advantage of the NEC Starlet
 CP/M portable don't you??
(PhilW) [Oh Oh!]
(rowlfe) uhhhhh, no.... what is it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) You get to carry all your troubles with you!!!
(Rich L) hahaha
(rowlfe) [gee, left myself open for that one, didn't I?]
(PhilW) [You were warned!]
 Dave, did you know that IBM named their portable a Convertable because
 you need wheels to transport it?


(Terry G.) Does anyone know how to disable "Call Waiting"?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Best way is to call the telephone company and stop paying for
  it!! Permanently disable it!! [we did that!]
(Sysop Tony) One of the PHNTIP files in DL1 describes a method that is being
 implemented around the country, and may be available in your area.
(PhilW) Denny Thomas has call waiting and lives with it, I guess.  You might
 leave him a message on the SIG.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) PHNTIP.002 is by Denny. In DL 1.


(PhilW) Back in 1983/84, I did a series of BSTPGM files.  Now some more are
 needed.  Seems like a good assignment for Eiji, as keeper of the CATS.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I've had that project in mind with even a list of programs
  prepared. Now all I have to do is DO IT!! "Other things" interfere.
(Eiji) I think what one thinks the best depends upon individual's taste.
 how can that be done?
(PhilW) Helps to be opinionated -- I;m well qualified!
(Sysop Tony) Why not conduct a survey; have folks leave a list of the ones they
 think are best, and make up a composite file on the subject?
 [Ten Best, or some such?]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Could be done I spoz but with difficulty currently.
(PhilW) [I'd say 20 best]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Would need to category things. As in the three best
  from each DL ??? Best of this, best of that, et cetera.
(Sysop Tony) Many DL's don't HAVE three good programs.
(PhilW) [True. I haven't uploaded to all of them!]
(Sysop Tony) [A litttle conceit there, Phil?]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) EGO igor.
(PhilW) [Just a little!]
(Sysop Tony) I'd still think that "Ten Best" from any subject would be best
 idea, then separate them out in the file. As in 10 best games, 10 best
 utilities, etc.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, the time has come the snail said ...
  This here COnference is ended ...
  continue chat as needed.
