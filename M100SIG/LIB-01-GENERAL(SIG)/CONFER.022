(Sysop .^Dave^.) Da droops iz gath'rin!
(<Curtis G.>) Dave what is the topic for today 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Iz open topics today Curtis, wanna pyk one??
  We is started ...

(larry l) We were talking last week about file transfers between comps.
 I think I have a way to transfer files between Apple and M100 if anyone
 is interested.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks that folks could well be interested in a file
 submitted to the SIG Data Library. Specifically DL 1,but t'would chew up a lot
 of time to explain it here. Am I correct in assuming your method is different
 than what is in APP100.TXT and APP100.DO ???
(larry l) i think so..it uses either DOS basic commands or it can use
 Applewriter prodos. I have a 2500 char file prepared already.  maybe one of
 you could help me get it on DL or I could transmit it now.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) DON'T try to transmit it now!!
  the CO software wouldn't appreaciate that at all and you would find yourself
  in Siberia with the rest of us in Antarctica. Put it in DL 1 with the
  assistance of the UPLOAD.HLP file from DL 0 and we'll take a gander.


(Paul P.) Does anyone know how the 100 converts a real number
 to and from a .DO file? 
(John R) Don't understand question, could you explain further?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Paul P, clarify your number question for John and us'ns.
(Paul P.) it seems to me that when storing real numarical data in a text
 file there is something going on to convert back and forth to ascii, is there
 a way to stor direct numeric dat as it is in variables??
(John R) Well, BASIC has its rules for conversions, if that is what you are
 asking. As for storing and retrieving actual binary values in a .DO file,
 'twould probably require some machine language programming.
(Sysop Tony) The .DO file,m by it's very nature is an ASCII file. numbers, as
 well as text are stored as ASCII characters but when you write to the file,
 or retrieve from the file, BASIC does the conversions automatically.
(Paul P.) yes , what I was thinking about was compressing data thru a new
 routine and was wondering what exactly went on in the storage process.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) there is a new file in the database DL 4, CRUNCH.100 that is a
 TEXT file compression utility; the coding there may be of interest to you.
(John R) The internal representations of data in BASIC are given in
 "Hidden Powers ...", if that's what you need, but as I said you would need to
 code in Machine Language to get at the data in that form.
(Paul P.) This routine needs to be very fast and interactive from a basic pgm.


(<Curtis G.>) I have a question concerning what causes the 100 to add extra
 lines when converting a program back to basic.
 has any one else had this problem?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well Curtis, ya see, Ron Suzuki out with Kyocera put a
 lyqimpus in each of the wakpyls when he first programmed the Model 100.
(Sysop Tony) Huh?
(<Curtis G.>) thanks Dave 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Anyone gawt a better answer???
(Sysop Tony) What do you mean, "extra lines?"
(<Curtis G.>) It appears to happen only when the program approaches 1/2 of the
 ram avial; as the program was being stored to basic after editing it would
 insert extra spaces and sometimes lines.
 Note: I was running the chip software when this happened.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Aha!
(Sysop Tony) When you invoke EDIT, the program is converted to a .DO file and
 when you F8 it, it is merged back into the existing program.  It may be that
 as you approach a full machine with two versions in RAM, the OS does funny
 things.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Recommend that you NEVER play around in Basic until you've
 turned CDOS off first.


(RICH L) just wanted you to know that I've got the DISK-TERM program to working
 so as to D/Load to the PDD while on line automatically.
(Sysop Tony) Fine, You gonna upload it to DL5???
(joel) Rich: PLEASE upload
(Sysop Tony) Haven't yet received what was supposed to be #1 copy of POWR-D for
 the 200... (whimper, sniff)
(RICH L) ok.... will do, I thought I'd first work in an upload section too.
(Sysop Tony) Download is the most desired feature.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) if that is purely for Telcom file transfer to/from TDD,
 please place in DL 1.


(Marty T) This is the same subject; I'm looking for a program to upload from
 the TDD to a host computer
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Marty, methinks you'll have to wait in line. Major
 diffookultees involved which Rich et alia are working on ...
 Patience else patients ...
(Marty T) thanks. I'll be watching 


(RICHARD WENER) just got super rom & wanted to see if others have been
 playing with it
(Sysop .^Dave^.) None of the folks currently in the room have Super ROM as yet,
 to the best of my knowledge but there has been yak on the message board.
 You may want to use the command RS;S;SUPER;0 for whatever has been said
 in the past few days.


(RossR) Just wanted to know if someone could direct me to a source for
 Carl Oppendahls book on M100
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummph; Weber Systems is the place to call.
  They have an 800 number so meybe 800 information can give it to you Monday.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Curtis, what was on your mind about compression programs?
(<Curtis G>) what I am tring to do is to print information to the screen for an
 input and then print to a file whit the same statement and the input.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That should be no problem don't see where "compress" comes
 into that.
(Sysop Tony) Hmmm... in light of Dave's comment, this may not be relevant...
 Seems I recall N. Arley Dealey has expressed some expertise in the area of
 file compression algorithms. You might want to message him.. he's here often.
 Also, There is a file in DL6 describing LAP CODER, a program that does file
 compression.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) LAPCOD.PRD is the commercial prgrm and we have CRUNCH.100
 which I've not tested.
(joel) crunch works to my satisfaction; not sure I like the interface


(Tom Buckley) WHAT HAPPENED TO PORT 100 MAG?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I talked to Senior Editor yesterday and he expects most
 subscribers will receive January issue in the coming week.
 [Note: January '86 issue received 10-Feb by .^Dave^. on regular subscription]

(RICHARD WENER) Still struggling w/ 3 super rom manuals anywhere I get Lucid
 help (templates?) on board?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) There are Lucid templates in DL 2, use the S/KEY LUCID command
 there. Lotza Lucid helpers on the message board too.
(Sysop Tony) I understand there are even some to help with your taxes.


(RICH L) Does CRUNCH.100 really work the best I can save with it is bout 10%
(Sysop Tony) as I recall, the author indicated a maximum of about 25% that may
 mean a lower minimum figure. Don't know exactly what algorithm he's using.
 LAP CODER claims about 35%, and is in machine language. The info there is it
 depends on what's in your file, and I suspect that comment would hold true for
 CRUNCH, too.
(joel) don't know how crunch works, either; haven't had a chance to take it
 apart yet.  I've gotten about 20% compression on the three files I've tried;
 decided at that point I was going to take the program apart before I used it
 again because it's SLOW, doesn't tell what's happening, and I don't yet
 understand how it works. I've tried transferring files with it to m' BBS &
 back, which works just fine; so I'll likely get to work on it when I weary
 of TDD/PD software.


(:Lan Y:) I have been on a trip for the last 2 weeks in Europe...poor me...
 No CIS, No M100Sig. Have there been any blockbusters come up of the order of
 DSKL or DSKMGR??
(Sysop Tony) No, not in the last week or so, but earlier in this CO, Rich
 indicated he had developed a terminal emulator program that would allow
 Downloading direct to disk and would be uploading it to DL1 soon.
(:Lan Y:) OOOOOOH! Can't wait 
(Sysop Tony) I believe POWR-D is required.
(RICH L) Not to lead anyone astray. This system I'm using does require some
 hardware and a second modem.
(Sysop Tony) Ah....
(:Lan Y:) Rats.
(John R) [Ahaha!]
(Sysop Tony) Then it's a project, not a program....
(RICH L) it's a program too.... the second modem is not hooked to the M-100.
(Sysop Tony) Of course, one can do that now, by plugging and unplugging the
 external modem, and TDD.
(RICH L) I am using it right now, everthings automatic and fast.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, I get the picutre of what you are doing, from your previous
 comments; you use the external modem to hold the line, while you disconnect
 the M100, and dump to disk. With the Tandy 200, you can do that too.
(RICH L) right. I use the cassette motoron and off command to control the other
 modem.
(Sysop Tony) Well, with the Tandy 200, you can use the external modem at 1200
 (if capable) and disconnect from the modem, without disconnecting from the
 line.  Looks like I'll have to write a file on transferring from one computer
 to another while still on line.  I've been doing it for some time, but didn't
 think there would be much interest.
(joel) Rich--- a couple questions....
 first, how much does the hardware cost (excluding modem)
 and second, I understood you to say (a couple weeks back) that you were
 transferring one line at a time.
(RICH L) I bought a new Modem 1 B from RS at 30.00 and the rest was less than
 8.00. I have scratched the one line at a time for a large chunk at a time.
(joel) ok  seemed like a better approach to me, but I wanted to see the code.
(Sysop Tony) I'd think parts cost would be greater than that. With RS-232
 connectors, modular connectors, relay, DIN plug to go into the computer
 cassette jack, etc.
(RICH L) all ther is, is a relay and small battery; you don't even use the
 rs232 plug on the modem.
(Sysop Tony) You'll have to include a good description, or schematic.
(joel) yes! please!
(RICH L) all it is is a relay that is controled by the cassette on off.
 the relay connects the phone line between the modem and wall.


(Sysop Tony) Anyone interested in the progress on the Chipmunk spelling
 checker? Well, the machine language program promised for late January,
 never materialized.  We've jumped on to the third generation program
 which is based on random access of the dictionary files on disk; spends a lot
 less time looking up words. In tests so far, it takes 1/4 the time to check
 documents.  But the trade-off is that it takes more time to build the
 dictionary files and the old dictionaries are unusable except to transfer into
 the random access format.
(John R) Is random access from BASIC compatible between CDOS and the 600?
(Sysop Tony) And the 600?
(John R) Yup. Unnerstand that there are GET's and PUT's in the 600's BASIC.
 Wondering if they were the same as used in CDOS.
(Sysop Tony) Well, I've done no work along that line, at all. The CDOS disk,
 of course, is not readable by the Tandy 600. But if the program (it's in
 BASIC) were converted, I'm sure it would work just as well on the 600.
(John R) Thats what I was curious about.


(joshua) I was wondering if added mem chips run off batteries same as the
 internal chips when power is off
(Sysop Tony) Memory chips (actually modules) that you add to bring your
 computer up to 32K operate off the internal batteries. Memory expansion
 modules that can bring your computer up to 128K in banks of 32K, use the
 system power when the computer is on and have their own battery to maintain
 memory if the computer is off, or the module is removed from the computer.
(joshua) Thanks, just making sure. I'm getting a 24k module for my Tandy 200
 from Purple Computing and I need it.
(Sysop Tony) That's an internal module and it operates entirely from the system
 batteries.  BTW, I have one from Purple, and have had no problems with it.


12:49:26 PM EST Sunday, February 9, 1986


(Sysop Tony) Any last questions?
 OK....
 Then if you have no objections, Dave...
 We might end right here....
