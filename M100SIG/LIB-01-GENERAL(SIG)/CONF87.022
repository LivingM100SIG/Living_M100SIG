(Wayne S.) I downloaded a program called email5, and at the top menu prompt "!"
 the progdram sent "PRO", cis sent back, "access to programmers area denied"
 but later it worked fine. Why?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) tee hee ...
  That is a new error code that had the sysop world here in a tizzy a few weeks
  back. It used to be that when your primary host was down for primary
  maintenance that you couldn't get on at all. You would get a "CHB not
  available" or some such error before you could get to TOP. Recently, the
  software was enhanced to move you to a temporary host for the brief
  maintenance period required. Thus, if your primary host is CQD, you might be
  let in on CMT temporarily. HOWEVER, your personal file area on CQD isn't
  accessible from the temporary host.
(Wayne S.) thanks a lot, I rally like that program.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Glad to hear it still works after the CompuServe changes over
  the past months. Most folks are using EMAIL8.7MM I think.
(Phil W) [EMA5.9 is still fine]


(Larry L) I use the PCSG ram but I don't keep the RAM + rom in the socket
 so I need a small program to move files between banks (something like the GOTO
 programs left in ram).
(Mike A.) Well sir, I hate to say it can't be done - but it can't be done.
 Only way I know of is to use either TDD or Chipmunk to accomplish the same
 thing.   'Course NOTHING's impossible. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike means it can't be done until sumbaudee does it.
(Phil W) Right. In fact the code from RAM+ could be coded in a RAM file,
 similar to the PG Designs approach.  But PCSG would have to do it, and
 I doublt if it will happen.  Maybe Mike can infulence this.  Souldn't be hard
 to do FOR THEM!
(Larry L) Yes..I agree with Phil. If it can be done by a ROM then it can
 be done by a RAM program. Please check for me,Mike.  It will save my ROM
 socket. If yo can find the start of the code in ROM maybe I or someone else
 could convert.
(Mike A.) Okay, I will, but as you know, our company vowed never to market
 anything in cassette form again.   I'm afraid M. Stanford abhores using RAM,
 but I'll lobby on your behalf!
(Larry L) tne rom leaves a .co program so there is a precedent for this and
 these two utilities are probably the most needed.
 almost everything else can be done from basic.


(Larry L) Has anyone heard more about port 100?
 I dont even see old issues on the stands.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) (nope)^7


(Phil W) For Denny...
 when are you gonna write the definitive comm program for the M100 with split
 screen CO capability??
(Larry L) [yay]
(Denny T) I've messed around with split screen; given the capabilities,
 it's not too easy.
(Phil W) [ur capabilities or M100?]
(Denny T) you would have to hold the last line and out put to that line
 everything that you type. the M100 is the problem, not me Phil.
 geesh!
(Larry L) I agree with Denny. I dont think that split screen is the way to go.
 I have been using the updated DIRACC and it can't be beat. It allows you
 to stay connected while accessing BASIC or TEXT.
(Phil W) I think the way to go is to lock the last line and let it scroll left
 when you get past 40 chars, like THINK-IT, et al.
(Denny T) I have successfully locked the last line while online, but the M100
 doesn't allow easy access to that line once locked. it just thinks there is a
 smaller display. It would have to be done by stuffing the screen buffer.
(Phil W) [YES!]


(Dave D) Question for Mike A.
 Trying to use Write Rom with a serial printer; after sending the print command
 I get an "M100 Error 149", what is that error code?
(Mike A.) You got me therr..I'll have to check.
(Dave D) Ok..if you find out perhaps you can inform me.
(Larry L) Dave...did you change the output device to COM: ?
 if not you may be sending to an unconnected device; the manual doesn't
 list error codes (I think they should).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That error is defined by PCSG as follows:
  "Not your mistake. Call us with details." but without an 800 number.
(Mike A.) Call James Smith Collect and tell 'em Mike A. sent ya !
  (214) 351-0564.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Be interesting to see how that works for how long!!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Any FORTH folks present? Just now merged a new file with
  figFORTH implemented in a .CO program; more is to follow, but fellow has been
  using it for a year with pleasure.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Larry, NODE has new RAM expansion for 102 and 200 computers
so I figger that NODE.REV is about that. Haven't looked at it as t'was CO time.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) You folks figure that the "Best of Tandy Model 100 Forum"
  will be a best seller??
(R Caley) Who decided which were the best of m-100 forum??
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony did DL 9 and 10, Peripherals and Tandy 200, whilst I did
  the rest. Almost 95% are programs as the documentation for programs is not
  among the 500 selections; there are some articles or technical information
  files that are not programs, but mostly programs. At the price, methinks
  t'will save more than a few folks more than a few bucks searching for stuff.


(Peter T.) Saw an ad in PICO for pcsg new expansion for the 102.  They
 "mention" the expansion for the 100. Is it the same as always, or new type?
(Mike A.) It's basically the same, just uses the new, bigger K chips.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [page 10 of Feb Peter?]
(Peter T.) Yes Dave.


(R Caley) Mike A...can the 256K RAM run in tandem with Chipmunk on m-100?
(Mike A.) Good question!  I don't know yet, though, sorry.
 (sems like it would tho)
(R Caley) shall I call collect <grin>
(Mike A.) I'll check for ya!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, how do you get the Chipmunk board and the 256K board in
  the same place at the same time??
(Mike A.) Piggyback-style. 
(Larry L) Just wondering..what type of cable is used to connect chip and how
 long is it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ribbon, 18 inches.
(Mike A.) Yes, it connects underneath the M100, and uses plastic release tabs
 to either snap-in place to lock it in or just push them back to release the
 connector...Easy!


(Bill) If I want to DL for 100, what is the fastest way of signing on?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If the Model 100 Forum is your number one interest then you
  could GO DEFALT and change your logon actions to choose PCS-154 as your top
  page. Or, if you choose not to do that, just use G M100SIG at the first
  opportunity when logging on. That can be included in your ADRS.DO auto-logon.
(Bill) what's ga mean?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "ga" means "go ahead" - be sure to see CONFER.HLP file
  in DL 1 when you can.
(Bill) I have some 40 pages of directions for forums in my lap!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Bill, you may use CTRL-V to see what you've typed before
  pressing ENTER and CTRL-U to dump the typing buffer.
  The most essential file for you to understand is Bulletin 4 from this Forum,
  or DOWNLD.HLP from DL 1.  They are the same file.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gollee; a LOT of folks read the CO transcripts but seems that
  not so many want to contribute to contents!!


(Mike A.) About the "Best of ..."; I think it's 9.95, right?  is it paperback,
  computer sheets, or what?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmmmm, good question. Still at the printers, which is why
  folks are getting "Out of stock" messages when they order; but the orders ARE
  being taken and distribution will be fast.
  To answer - suspect binding similar to the regular Guide but I don't KNOW !!
(Mike A.) ah yes, the old "it's at the printers"; seems like we've had such
 troubles too !  and the contents are mostly program listings, or references
 to download them from the SIG ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Contents are an organized, indexed collection of 500 file
  descriptions as they are in the DL now. Not "program listings" as in "LLIST"
  but name and description - with Keywords [I think].
  I spent a lot of hours in its preparation.
(Mike A.) Okay thanks..an excellent idea. 


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Now what?
  Close early again?
(Mike A.) Might as well "bag it".
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay then, closing down now.
  Many thanks to all listeners and readers too!
