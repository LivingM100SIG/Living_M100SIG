9:00 AM PDT Sunday, May 31, 1987

(Sysop Tony) Good morning.

(JOE SCHMITT) GOOD MORNING TONY

(Sysop Tony) Hello, Joe.  Do you have upper and lower case letters?  Looks
  like you're shouting.

(JOE SCHMITT) I AM SUPPOSED TO MEET A FRIEND FROM CALIF. TODAY YES

(Sysop Tony) Who?

(JOE SCHMITT) THANK YOU

(Sysop Tony) Joe, you're still sending all upper case letters.  Do you have
  your caps lock key down ...

(JOE SCHMITT) LOOKING FOR 72300,1

(Sysop Tony) or have you not yet set your terminal defaults?

(JOE SCHMITT) hello how is that

(Sysop Tony) Ah, better.  Who is 72300,1?  (I don't know anybody by that
  name... er number [grin])

(JOE SCHMITT) It is a friend 72300,1217  His name is rick Hartley

(Rush C.) [Mornin' All]

(JOE SCHMITT) MOrnin to you to

(O.T.NEW) Q OT

(Sysop Tony) I see.  Did you make an appointment to meet him here this morning?

(JOE SCHMITT) Yes I did

(Sysop Tony) During the scheduled conference time?  (OK, OT, you'll be next)

(JOE SCHMITT) Yes it was at noon est

(Sysop Tony) Interesting.  Why would you make an appointment to meet someone in
  CO during the scheduled conference time?

(JOE SCHMITT) Forgive me, I'm new

(Sysop Tony) Ah!...  Well you can always use another...

(JOE SCHMITT) Another what?

(Sysop Tony) one of the channels.  Do you know how to change channels?

(JOE SCHMITT) Not sure

(Sysop Tony) OK, Joe... type /HELP for a list of the commands, ...

(REGINA DENNIS) HELP

(Sysop Tony) And read CONFER.HLP in DL1 as soon as you can.

(O.T.NEW) What is new in hard or software for 100?

(Sysop Tony) OT, both hardware and software are areas of constant change.
  You can review a weekly list of the new programs and files  that
  have been posted here by going into DL1, and typing DES.

(O.T.NEW) tony thanks.

(REGINA DENNIS) CAN I SEND A TELEX TO A NON ID COMPUSERVE USER?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, you can.  There is a way to send TELEXes from CompuServe  to
  regular Telex subscribers.

(Dana H.) HELP TELEX in easyplex will give info.  There are a few things to
  note, however Sometimes you need to prefix the TELEX  number with "0" so
  that is is properly  routed  and you can only send to a  TELEX or TWX
  subscruber, not a WU Easy Link.

(Sysop Tony) Thanks, Dana.  Appreciate the additional info.  ga Chuck  (Folks,
  "ga" means I am done, you can "go ahead")

(Chuck) Question, is there something in a DL that I could use to create
  employee schedules?

(Sysop Tony) Employee schedules?  You mean work schedules?

(Rush C.) [wouldn't that be sweet]

(Chuck) Yes

(Sysop Tony) Not that I'm aware of, but it doesn't seem that it would be too
  hard to design such a program.

(Chuck) That's what I thought, unfortunately I'm still not that software
  literate.

(Sysop Tony) Well, why don't you put a message on the board, in section 4,
  outlining what you need such a program to do, and perhaps someone will write
  it for you.

(Chuck) I've downloaded several and have tried to make them work, such as DBNEW
  and Spread.wm3.

(Sysop Tony) I think those programs are overkill in your application, Chuck.
   From your basic description  and from what I know about work schedules, all
  you need is something to print out work days and off days, for a list of
  employees, right?

(Chuck) True, Exactly, except each employees "slot changes"week to week  And it
  should be easier to use a computer once it's set up.

(Sysop Tony) OK... the "slot changes" may be the quirky part of the program.
   however my previous advice, post a message, still stands.  ga Rush

(Rush C.) Ok  not too much more to add  however, scheduling is MUCH more
  intracate than just printing what you already know.  You have to program in
  all work times and vacations for employees and see there are no conflicts,
  etc.  I had a bear of a time with the same problem  when I was teaching
  school trying to put which kid in which class at what time, etc.

(Sysop Tony) Well, Rush... do you think a spreadsheet approach would be best?

(Rush C.) No..but if I were going to use a spreadsheet, I would use one like
  LUCID that has the TBL function  that can return text values and setup
  special lookup tables.  Personally, I think the program should be designed
  like a program that can generate crossword puzzles instantly from a group
  of words.  you need some type of ML alogrithm that can sort and test each
  employees schedule and match up vacation times  without conflicts.

(Sysop Tony) Sounds like such a program would have a lot of IF-THEN decisions.

(Chuck) I didn't want something that elegant, just  something with the
  provision to enter a few changes. A spreadsheet winds up sorting all the
  elements, when I'd only need to sort one column.

(Sysop Tony) Well, again, I suggest you leave a message  on the board.  Maybe
  someone has something already written.  I didn't know Rush had worked with
  such an application but you never know.  Any more on that, Chuck?

(Chuck) Negative, unless Rush has anything to add.

(Rush C.) ok  Chuck, in your message on the board  BE VERY PRECISE as to
  EXACTLY what you want the program to do. I'm not sure as to your precise
  needs But I'll work on it if I see your file there.

(Sysop Tony) OK Chuck?

(Chuck) Thanks, and OK

(O.T.NEW) CAN an apple monitor go w/ 100?

(Sysop Tony) OK.... Now, OT, on your question  about using an Apple Monitor.
   None of the portable computers supported here  have video capability, so no
  monitor will work directly with them.  There is, however, a Disk/Video
  interface for the 100/102/200  which allows a video display.  Sort of
  overkill once again, but if you want it, it's available.   the DVI should be
  able to connect to any standard monitor. 

(Larry L) ok  How does the DVI decode the m100 screen?  It should be much
  cheaper if you only want to get video.  Also..what is  dvi image like..

(Sysop Tony) There have been two video devices  besides the DVI on the market.
   The first one didn't work well, and the company failed.  The second one was
  advertised for about a year but none were ever produced, or delivered, to the
  best of my knowledge, and it is no longer advertised.  The DVI (and
  presumably other such devices) connect to the system buss, and intercept the
  signals going to the screen CPU, and route them to a CRT display. In theory,
  such a device can be built.  To date, there isn't one on the market, although
  a lot of users have asked for one. The DVI CRT screen display can be either
  40 or 80 columns  and 24 (25) lines.  (24 and a status line).  The 40 column
  display is quite good.  The 80 column display  seems "squashed" to me,  but
  then, I'm used to a more commercial computer where such a display would be
  laughed off the market.

(Rush C.) ok  [not laughing]  I am on a DV/I right now  and you know me, I
  LOVE the DV/I!  It makes for a great little workstation. I agree, the 80 col
  mode is a bit small, But more than adequate for cetain stuff.  I like being
  able to use IDEA! and TBASE with 25 lines on the screen rather than 8.

(Sysop Tony) Different strokes, Rush.  (grin)  ga Larry

(Larry L) ok  Can't you increase the horiz width if  the display is squashed?
  Is the monitor part of the unit or separate?

(Sysop Tony) No, The screen width in my case, is about 8 inches. ... The DVI
  will fit either 40 characters, or 80 characters in that space.  the 80
  character mode's letters are naturally half the width of the 40 character
  mode, thus looking "squashed".  The monitor is seperate from the box that
  holds the electronics and disk drive, so you can use whatever monitor you
  want.  I have an Amdek 300.

(Larry L) OIC...

(Sysop Tony) OK.... Did all that anwer your question, OT?  ga OT

  Huh!  OT didn't stick around  to see the fruits of his question.

(Larry L) Is the printer interface a one-way  device?  Is it possible to
  use it as an input?

(Sysop Tony) Yes and no.  (good answer, huh?)

(Larry L) [great]

(Sysop Tony) It can't be used as a parallel data port to get data into the
  computer.  But the printer port can be "sampled"  so you can read data bits
  from the port, and use it to  monitor external control functions, like
  alarms, relays, lights, etc.

(Larry L) Could you expand on sampling a bit?

(Sysop Tony) There is a file in DL8 describing that; It's either PORTS.100 or
  PORTS.USE.  Probably the latter.  And it's something I've read, but don't
  recall the exact details.

(Larry L) ok...thanx

(Sysop Tony) What did you have in mind for that?

(Larry L) like you said,  alarms ..industrial control..etc  but a serial to
  parallel converter would work just as well.

(Sysop Tony) As I recall, there is a chapter section in  "Inside the Model
  100" by Carl Oppedahl on using that port to read switches, too.

(R Caley) I was gone and dropped in late  but I think there's a company
  that advertises and specializes in those types of uses for M-100..

(Sysop Tony) Yeah... (Parallel port input, on page 265 of the book, Larry)
  There are several analog-to-digital devices advertised.  The cheapest is
  about $200, while they can go up to more than $1000.  One of our former
  members,  Peter St. Clair, did a lot of remote control work and used several
  of those devices.  He had a lot of remote control goodies hooked up around
  his apartment.  But we lost him to the Atari, and haven't heard from him
  in some time.  Unfortunately, he left no files describing his work.

(MARC K) HI ALL  FIRST TIME HERE-NOT USED TO THE RULES!

(Sysop Tony) Was that it, Marc?  OK... here is a primer...
  Send a "Q" to get in speaking lineup to ask a question or change topic; ...
  Send a "C" to comment on the current topic.  Use CTRL-C to exit
  back to the forum; but stay! You might learn something new.

(R Caley) [macros]

(Sysop Tony) [yup, what else?]

(Larry L) Is the Oppedahl book the hot new one I've been hearing about?

(Sysop Tony) No, it's been out for about a year.  But what is this "hot new
  one" you've been hearing about? .... I haven't heard about a hot new one.

(Larry L) A year?...I think that it IS the one and  I just haven't seen it
  till now..Not many bookstores bother to carry M100 books..

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, that's a problem.  It was copyrighted in 1985, so it's been
  around for a while.  But you almost have to order it from the publisher. 
  Did you need that information?

(Larry L) No..I finally found it. thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK... Any more on THIS topic, anyone?  OK... then you're up now,
  Marc.  ga Marc ga

(MARC K) OK-DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE EXPANSION RAM BOARDS FOR
  THE M100?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  What is your question?

(MARC K) I'M INTERESTED IN THE 96K BOARD I'VE SEEN ADVERTISED AND NEED MORE
  INFO

(Sysop Tony) PCSG, who sell that RAM expansion board  has a representative on
  the message board,  who will be glad to send you additional information.
   Send a message to Mike Anders, 70526,1715.

(Larry L) Just wanted to say that I've been using PCSG RAM for a year or so
  and  can heartily reccommend it.  There was a bug in the Rom that went with
  it but PCSG sent me a new one air express.  a good company to deal with.

(Sysop Tony) Marc, There are some new RAM expansion products available for the
  100/102. PCSG has a 256K unit that gives you 8 "banks" which can be used  the
  same as the original bank. See their advertising in current issues of
  popular magazines. Node Computers has a 256K bank that apparently can be
  used as one continuous bank, to store large files, much as you would on a
  disk. See the file NODE.REV in DL13. And PG Designs is advertising one called
  the "Vault"... see VAULT.THD in DL13.

(MARC K) OK...TNX FOR THE INFO

(Sysop Tony) OK.... just us 3 here.

(MARC K) I SEE

(Sysop Tony) Does anyone have any pressing questions? ...

(Larry L) [and I gotta run]

(Sysop Tony) otherwise, the CO seems to be petering out this week.

(MARC K) ONE THING.. I HAVE ONE

(Sysop Tony) OK... see you again, later, Larry.

(Larry L) See you next week  bye.

(MARC K) I HAVE A COPY OF SMART SIG...IT DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK CORRECTLY...ANY
  INFO?

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, That's one of those programs that relies on certain prompts
  from CompuServe.  Unfortunately, CompuServe is constantly changing the
  software, so the prompts are constantly changing, and the "scripted"
  programs are constantly having to be revised.  It may work fine today, and
  not worth a damn tomorrow because of the changes.  The only thing you can
  do is to stay abreast of the changes, and change the program script
  accordingly.  The author of that program is no longer here, and C. Davey
  Utter has tried to make revisions to keep up with the changes, but he's not
  a skilled programmer, and admits it.  I'd suggest you look at EM8SIG instead,
  whose author is constantly updating the program, and supports it on the
  message board if you have problems.

(MARC K) I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT-MEANWHILE,I WILL DOWNLOAD FROM SIG WITH
  OTHER MACHINE AND UP LOAD IT TO THE M100

(Sysop Tony) Well, whatever, but why not download it directly into the 100?

(MARC K) BECAUSE CIS NEEDS XMODEM,AND I DONT YET HAVE A COPY OF A XMODEM PGM
  FOR THE M100

(LARRY R.) C

(Sysop Tony) OK.... first off, CIS doesn't "require" Xmodem, and anyway, we
  have several Xmodem programs in DL3 for the 100 which can be downloaded and
  used, too.

(LARRY R.) x

(MARC K) I DID NOT SEE  A OPTION FOR ASCII IN THE SIG

(Sysop Tony) Heh heh... Larry was that a comment, then a "cancel" comment?

(LARRY R.) Since you are  addressing what I was gonna say, yes, but  I wanna
  add a Q to the Queue? <grin> 

(Sysop Tony) OK, Marc, We have prepared a file on downloading, which provides
  greater detail than we can in this conference situation. To read the file,
  type the letter B at the main menu function prompt (where you can read or
  leave messages) and press the ENTER key. At the next menu, type the number
  4 and press ENTER to read the file. Suggest you echo a copy to your
  printer for later review. (Turn on Printer and press F5 button)  OK?  Any
  more on that, Marc?

(MARC K) OK, BUT HAVENT MADE A CABLE FOR MY PRINTER (SERIAL) TO LET ME USE IT
  ON M100

(Sysop Tony) OK.... but you can't echo to a serial printer anyway.  "Echo",
  F5, only works with a parallel printer.

(MARC K) I SEE,  O WELL-I CAN ALWAYS USE OTHER MACHINE THEN (2 DRIVES)

(Sysop Tony) Grin  How can you "download", before learning how to
  "download"????   Catch 22.   Anyway ...

(MARC K) TRUE,

(Sysop Tony) the B;4 file will give you great detail on downloading into the
  M100.

(MARC K) BUT I KNOW HOW ON THE OTHER MACHINE, AND THE M100 ALSO,BUT JUST NOT
  SURE HOW TO GET ASCII MODE ON CIS.

(Sysop Tony) All the files here in the DL's are stored  as ASCII text
  files.... except a few that are binary or other special forms.  But for most,
  you just read them with the <R>ead command and capture them by pressing
  the F2 button on the M100.  So, it is said that the M100 family uses the
  "capture" protocol.   OK?

(MARC K) OK,TNX MUCH..I SHOULD BE GOING NOW...SEE YA LATER!

(Sysop Tony) Wait...

(MARC K) OK

(Sysop Tony) Larry may }i~rhave some more info for you.  ga Larry

(LARRY R.) Enter DL3 then REA XMODEM.312.  before pressing enter/CR key,
  press your F2 key, it will prompt you for a filename, enter XMODEM  then CR,
  wait for DOWN to appear in reverse video, them hit CR again  the file
  should scroll by, when it stops hit F2 again, DOWN should return to regular
  video.  Once offline, you edit the xmodem file taking all of the crap
  before first program line and all the stuff after the end of the last program
  line then go to basic, in basic, you load the XMODEM.DO file into basic.
  Once the wait  sign stops flashing, and the ok prompt appears, SAVE it
  as XMODEM.BA, then KILL XMODEM.DO. Did I miss anything, Tony or Denny?

(Sysop Tony) No, but there is more detail in the DOWNLD.HLP file which I
  already referred him to, because we generally don't want to go into that
  much detail here.  (grin)  but anyway, did you have any more questions on
  that, Marc?

(MARC K) NONE...TNX I SHOULD BE GOING NOW...SEE YA ALL LATER...

(LARRY R.) I was gonna say  he could use the other filename to get the Download
  tips I was trying to be specific to the basic M100 built in thing, as I
  remember being a little cornfused by the range of options mentioned in
  the UPLOAD and DOWNLOAD help files.  At that point, I would have appreciated
  a file which confines itself to the one basic method.

(Sysop Tony) So what you're saying is that we need a step-by-step method?

(LARRY R.) Well, in my case, I needed the PHD level (Push here, Dummy)  of
  instruction, and still do on new things!!!  I may belong to Mensa but that
  doesn't make me a fast learner in ALL areas!  <GRIN>

(Sysop Tony) I have not reviewed the DOWNLD.HLP file in some time  but as I
  recall, it goes into step-by-step instructions for both capture and Xmodem
  downloads.  Will have to check.  Dave wrote the file, and as I recall, I
  didn't think he covered enough about converting files into programs.  Will
  look again.  Now about MENSA...  That's one organization I refused to
  join, by refusing to take the test.  do they still test applicants?

(LARRY R.) I didn't take the test either, but they  do test folks.  If you
  have a test on file, SAT, or in my case, Henmon-Nelson and document it (via
  school xscript, etc.) you do not have to be tested.

(Sysop Tony) Oh, that's interesting. I did have a documented test, the
  Minnesota Multiphasic as I recall but it wasn't recognized, I guess.  Anyway
  I hear there is a group more exclusive than MENSA now.  (grin)

(LARRY R.) Yes there are two.

(Dana Hyde) The MMPI is an }iinteresting  personality/psychological test, not
  one for intelligence whereas the SAT and similar measure intelligence.

(Sysop Tony) Really?  There is a section on the report form that specified
  tested and adjusted IQ, as I recall  it... it was some years ago, like in the
  late 50's that I took it.  Interesting subject, though.

(LARRY R.) There are two new groups more "exclusive" than MENSA  BTW, I too
  understood the MMPI NOT to be a standardised intelligence test ooops!
  Typing was not on the test anywho  If you took the ACT or SAT or GRE, or
  some such other in college and those scores are on your college transcript
  you can use those.

(Sysop Tony) Then there's the 100 group.  Sharp people (mostly) (grin)

(LARRY R.) OF COURSE WE ARE!

(Sysop Tony) When _I_ was in school, SAT, etc... were not yet popular.  In
  fact, SAT was just becoming regular as I was leaving.  And there is no such
  mention on my transcripts.  Anyway.... ga Joshua

(Joshua) Pardon me for jumping into the middle of this conversation  the SAT,
  GRE, and other Educ. Testing Service exams are *not* intelligence tests;
  merely predictors of future academic performance.  If that is intelligence,
  we're in trouble!!

(Sysop Tony) (And I've never even heard of GRE!)

(LARRY R.) Graduate Record Exam

(Joshua) Graduate Record Exam

(Sysop Tony) Anyway.... back to Model 100 topics, folks????  Larry had a Q way
  back there... did you have something to ask , Larry?  or  shall we keep
  rambling?

(LARRY R.) It had something to do with XMODEM, but I don't quite know what it
  was So let me ask about alternative  DOS for the TDD2.  Are there any yet,
  and if so, where can I read about them here in the DL's?

(Sysop Tony) OK... let me make this comment on Xmodem first - I've been using
  XMODEM.312 for some time, and have made some modifications to it for sysop
  requirements. ... But was always unhappy that it did not support Hayes
  modems at 1200 buad (external).  Leonard Erickson has revised the program
  extensively and is continuing to work on it, and his latest version is
  XMDM26.100 in DL3.  It's superior to the old version,  and he's provided
  cross reference and commented "pretty" listings of the program, which make
  it much easier to understand, modify and work with.  It also support 1200
  and 2400 baud, and external Hayes compatible modems.  You might like to look
  at it.  Now about the alternate DOS's.  Dave Thomas reports that the only
  one currently available,  is the one from Traveling software.  While
  UltraSoft has indicated they are working on a modification, it's not yet
  available.  Unfortunately TS doesn't provide updated product info files for
  our DL13 any more,  so the only info you get is from members on the message
  board.   Phil may be preparing a THREAD file on the subject, I don't know.

(Phil W) There is one.  There is a  THD file in DL9 on the OS situation forthe
  TDD2.  Unfortunately, don't have the name .. wait

(Sysop Tony) Phil has produced so many thread files of late, I can't keep up
  with the names, either.  (grin) Looks like we'd better keep a copy of  the
  THREAD.CAT file handy. (grin)

(Phil W) TDD2A.THD  [just looked at the copy I keep on HD]

(Sysop Tony) OK....  Any more, Larry?

(LARRY R.) TDD2A.THD?

(Phil W) yes.

(LARRY R.) DL9?

(Phil W) yes

(Sysop Tony) OK

(LARRY R.) Okay, think I'll go over to the library and do a little light
  reading.

(Sysop Tony) Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.
