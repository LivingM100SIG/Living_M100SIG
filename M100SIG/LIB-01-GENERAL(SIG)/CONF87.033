(Tom A.) HI ALL!  q

(Denny T) sure go ahead (ga)

(Tom A.) I was looking at a ML sorce Pgm (Xmodem I beleive)  I noticed that it
  was written in Z80 mneumonics Is this the same  codes that the 80c85 uses .

(Denny T) yes, there are just added codes in the Z80 set
  like all the relative jumps and added register op codes.

(Tom A.) Interesting. Is ther a summary some where as to what the diffs are  I
  mean the added codes you said.

(Denny T) Yes, most of the books have cross references
  that show the differences.  Hi ynoT.

(Sysop Tony) Good morning all.  No special Topic for today: Your choice.

(Larry L) OK  I was just wondering... why is that when  the m100 crashes it
  seems to just trash the Directory?  Several recovery programs  just seem to
  read RAM to a file.

(Sysop Tony) A cold-start resets the system pointers, but doesn't really
  "clear" the memory.

(Larry L) ok  Is there any way to reconstruct the  directory?  I might be
  faster than dumping RAM.

(Sysop Tony) Yes... but only if you knew what it was before the crash,  and
  manually poke the correct addresses and information back into the correct
  slots.  A time consuming,  and probably not effective technique.

(Tom A.) Larry, There was a promotion pgm that PCSG had  some years passed
  called RESTOR this filled the directory menu with .DO files that  could then
  be edited to get back the text files at least.

(Sysop Tony) Any followup Larry?

(Larry L) No..thanks..

(Sysop Tony) OK... Thanks TOM  that sounds like an interesting idea  and
  possibly still useful.  I'd think that you could recover even tokenized
  programs, albeit as text files and could detokenize them with DETOKE from
  our DL.

(Tom A.) Oh  I got the write up of the program now  It looks at the directory
  and builds .DO files based on the size of the files there.  I think that it
  could also determine what type of file was there. You think?

(Sysop Tony) Maybe one of our smart programmers  can come up with a similar
  approach.  It's the first time I've heard of it.  Thanks for the info.

(RichW) Thanks...good morning...

(Tom A.) I dont see a copyright

(RichW) I just wanted to know if anyone,  had personal experience with the
  Kyocera-Kyotronic on close out in "Computer Shopper"
  also, are there any left?

(Sysop Tony) Rich... it's not made by Kyocera.  Have you read the  file
  KYO85.INF in DL13?

(RichW) no, but  I will as soon as I sign off!

(Sysop Tony) OK... No sense in going into detail here.  But it's a copy.  And
  we would have no way of knowing if the liquidator has many (any) left.

(Tom A.) I got walked on before.  I was going th say  That I will contact PCSG
  to see if their RESTOR pgm could be UPLOADED here.

(Sysop Tony) Thanks.

(R Caley) Thanks  I just picked up Port. Comp. Review  There is a "club 100
  advertised there anyone know if this is a reputable outfit?
  JD Hildebrand seems to be affiliated with the mag  But it is a special
  issue are they going to continue??

(Sysop Tony) Here we go again.  Rush... Portable Computer Review is published
  by the Portable 100 folks.  It was made up last year, when J.D. was still
  working for them and just recently released to generate cash flow.

(R Caley) ok. 'nuff said

(Sysop Tony) It is a one-shot, and will not be continued.
  There have been numerous questions about it on the board,  primarily because
  folks confused it with J.D.'s new Laptop User which is just coming out this
  week.  Club 100 is the name of a private BBS located in the San Francisco
  area run by Rick Hanson, who has dreams of running the largest private BBS
  dedicated to portable computing.  Your membership fee, is essentially a
  users fee, since subscriptions to Laptop user are free anyway.  There is
  going to be some cooperation between J.D.'s magazine and the BBS.

(R Caley) Sorry i'm so far behind  but I only get here once a week..thanks

(Denny T) Sounds like a good topic for an INF file, Tony

(Sysop Tony) Yes, but I have limited information...  sounds like something
  someone on the advisory board should write. (grin)  Rush... We appreciate
  your choosing Sunday, as the one day a week you can get here.  Any more
  comments on that topic, anybody?

(none)

(Marty T) thanks  Last night I crashed my T-200 again while moving stories
  from one bank to another I had to turn off the Memory switch to get it
  working again Anyone with similar problems?

(Sysop Tony) Well, I use a Tandy 200 all the time  and don't recall EVER
  having a cold start.  I also use the built-in COPY function to move files
  and programs back and forth.  So it may just be peculiar to your  situation.
   Unfortunate, but nothing much you can do about it.

(Marty T) My only protection is a PDD _ good protection at that.  I was kind of
  hoping there would be some way to stop it short of the repair shop. Thanks.

(Sysop Tony) Yes... "Blessed are the pessimists, for they  hath made backups."
   Book of Fred, 13:22

(Marty T) [Amen]

(Sysop Tony) (grin).... just use careful technique, and backup, backup,
  backup.  Any more on that, Marty?

(Marty T) no.

(Sysop Tony) Well  one final comment... I don't think it warrants a
  (expensive) trip to the shop.  I don't think they will find anything wrong.

(Marty T) That's probably true _ I'll live with it as long as I can get it
  going again.

(Sysop Tony) Let me pose a question...  But first, what was the "t" for, Bill?

(JOHN PLUMMER "BILL") Sorry for the delay back again, were you  ready for open
  questions?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  And you're up.  ga Bill

(JOHN PLUMMER "BILL") I tuned on late and may have missed it  Has the magazine
  Portable 100 gone out of business?

(Sysop Tony) Actually no.  They have had considerable difficulty, but
  according to editor Alan Ziechick,  the "January" issue went to the post
  office on Thursday.  Folks should start receiving them this week.  Also,
  Laptop User subscribers should start getting the new magazine this week.
   Portable 100 indicates they are readying another issue for delivery in
  May and hope to go monthly after that.  Subscribers will get all the
  issues they paid for.

(Tom A.) Where can I get more info on Laptop User.

(Sysop Tony) See the file MAG.100 in DL13 for free subscription info.  J.D.
  Hildebrand, former editor of Portable 100 and his wife are publishing, and
  are not charging for subscriptions.  It is a "controlled circulation"
  publication.  J.D. is also active here on the message board, and has been an
  occassional guest in COnferences.  

(David E) ok  Is there a product that will remove minor scratches from  my
  screen?  It came in contact with some very fine sandpaper in the backpack I
  had it in.

(Sysop Tony) That HAS come up before.  but I don't recall what was
  recommended.  do you remember, Denny?

(Denny T) I seem to remember toothpaste as a likely fix.

(Sysop Tony) Sorry, David.  Perhaps you should put a message on the board
  about it.  Someone may remember, exactly.

(David E) Ok thanks.

(PETER) TOOTHPASTE WAS RECOMENDED

(Sysop Tony) Any particular brand?

(PETER) no

(David E) with brush or finger?

(Sysop Tony) I would think perhaps one of those with fine pumice brands,
  like is made for "smoker's".

(JOHN PLUMMER "BILL") tooth paste should be recommended by ADA  (Grin), I
  happen to be a DDS.

(Sysop Tony) So... put in fresh batteries, and see your dentist twice a year.
  (grin)

(Denny T) I wouldn't try the pumice style toothpasts
  it would probably leave a fine dull  haze on the screen  I seem to remember
  the finger being the best tool.

(Sysop Tony) That wouldn't be bad, Denny.  Would cut down on the glare.

(PETER) I've also tried Meguiar's  Mirror glaze Plastic Polish - it helps..

(JOHN PLUMMER "BILL") use what is known as flour pumice, water  and your
  thumb, and mabye your friendly dentist could help you out.

(Sysop Tony) OK. Enough on that, David?  Think that'll cure the problem?

(David E) agreed, [Aqua-fresh didn't help]

(Tom A.) What program has replaced LOAD.BA?

(Sysop Tony) LOAD.BA????  What was LOAD for?

(Tom A.) This was for loading HEX type prm.

(Sysop Tony) LOAD.BA is in DL7, so I guess it hasn't been replaced.  But I
  think most folks are using one called CHANGE now.  I prefer dedicated
  loaders, myself.

(Tom A.) Oh.  I have not gotten used to the new Order of things. GA DONE

(Sysop Tony) Oh, I see... you looked for it in the old DL, and couldn't find
  it.  Well, we did move things around a bit. (grin)

(MARK M.) thank you...i'm new at this
  i have a TDD2 if anyone had a question.  concerning it and powr DOS
   it is somewhat compatable.

(Sysop Tony) Are you in a position to state that the new TD2 works with
  POWR-DOS?

(MARK M.) yes, file transfer works fine but  the ipl for the tandy2 is
  simply"RUN"COM:98N1DNN" IT HAS NO DIP SWITCHES!!  it will not boot powr-dos
  from the disk after a cold start also "format.ba does not work,but
  lfilesformat does. I have found that the sector read/write's are the problem

(Sysop Tony) Are you in the mood to write a short file on what you've found?
   We could use something in DL13 like TD2-PD.REV for those who are thinking
  of using that combination.

(MARK M.) I've never uploaded a file(yet) but i'll give it a try  can you fill
  me in on uploading?

(Sysop Tony) OK... sure someone would appreciate the information.  See the
  file UPLOAD.HLP in DL1 for particulars, advice, recommendations, and other
  good stuff.  OK?

(MARK M.) about the TDD2?

(Sysop Tony) No, about uploading to the DL's.  So far, all we have on the TD2
  is a review and one tip file in DL9.

(MARK M.) I'll gather some more facts and get them to you all.

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Thanks.  Now, a quick survey  How many of you folks use the
  INDEX files, and do you download the long INDEX's from DL1?  If so, how do
  you keep them?  Disk?  Paper? What?

(David E) no

(BillB)     no

(MARK M.) yes /on paper

(Gerald G) no

(Sysop Tony) OK  Is it worth our time to continue publishing the long versions
  of the INDEX? and would you disk users download a copy to disk, and update
  it yourself if we provided a program and the information?

(Gerald G) yes

(David E) I would rather see a continuation of the m100 guide by compuserve

(MARK M.) it's the only way to get file descriptions without browsing isn't it?

(Sysop Tony) Any others?  OK... let me deal with those questions first. David,
  the "Guide" is only a limited sample, and will probably be upgraded only
  once a year. But will still only list 500 or so of the files we have.  It'll
  never be all-inclusive.

(Sysop Tony) Mark... the best way to see descriptions is to explore the .CAT
  files which group similar programs and files under a common heading. saves
  time, so you don't have to read lots of stuff to find the ones you want.
   But the question is whether the INDEX is useful. ....  It only lists  file
  names, where they are, who wrote them, and how big a file it is.  Unless you
  know the name, it's almost useless to find something.  Those who can
  download a copy to disk, and use a search program or who get a copy on
  paper, are virtually the only ones who  can benefit from the long INDEX
  versions.  We're looking at that now, to see if we can make it more useful,
  and if so, how.   Any questions or comments on that before we move on?

(Sysop Tony) OK  Then if no more comment  We'll move on.

(Gerald G) Right now I am using a model 4 for communications.
  This coming week  if I bought a m100 direct connect cable and a multi jack
  unit at Rc is it possible to get help online next Sunday in setting it up?

(Sysop Tony) Only if there is someone here who can support the Model 4.  I
  haven't the foggiest ideas about how to make it work.

(Gerald G) I meant the m100...the 4 is working beautifully.

(Sysop Tony) Oh, Well, there is no problem in getting the M100 to work,
  either.  just plug it in, and it should work.

(Gerald G) I know but the cable has two modular jacks...and i regret to say  I
  could not figure out yet what to hook for each  as I said if I got all the
  supplies together would there be help online?

(Sysop Tony) Well  it DOES come with instructions, and it's covered pretty
  well in the Owners manual, too.  But in case you have neither, someone here
  could look it up for you.

(Gerald G) Okay, I will get the supplies, read the instructions..practice here
  during the week and if I am still unsuccessful I will ask here next week.
  Okay?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, OK.... maybe I missed the point  being confuzled with the
  Model 4 reference but I thought you meant, "What do I do with the two
  wires on the Model 100's modem cable".  If that's the case, plug one into
  the wall, and the other into a telephone IF you WANT to.  It's not
  mandatory.

(Gerald G) I would not mix apples with oranges...I do get help for the model 4
  at the trs80 pro sig.  I mean if I am still unsuccessful in hooking up
  the m100 to a modular jack I assume I can get help for the m100 here. Okay?
  <sigh>

(Sysop Tony) I don't see how you could be unsuccessful.  it's as easy as
  plugging in a toaster.  But we'll be here again next week, and you can
  certainly ask then, if you wish.

(Gerald G) What do I do with the short loose jack? the seems be the problem?

(Sysop Tony) The "short, loose jack"  is used to put in the DIN plug, if you
  remove it from the computer...

(MARK M.) silver cable to phone,light brown to modular jack

(Sysop Tony) so you can continue to use the phone without  the computer there.

(Gerald G) How do I remove the wires from the short jack and the long
  one....they seem to be interconected?

(Sysop Tony) You do not remove the wires  you pull the DIN plug out of the
  socket on the back of the computer and stick the short bridging adapter into
  the plug.

(Denny T) Gerald, If you need help during the week,
  you can SENd a message to one of us  and we will try to help you online...

(Gerald G) I have the m100 in my lap, there is a 232C,  printer, phone,
  cassette ports is that one of the things I use?

(Denny T) see the file SEN.HLP in DL1 on how to do that.

(Sysop Tony) Gerald,  You plug the direct connect modem cable into the socket
  marked PHONE.  The plug has two wires coming out of it.  One is silver, one
  is beige.  Plug the silver one into a phone if you wish, or leave it dangle.
   Plug the beige one into the wall.
  If you remove the plug from the computer, put the adapter into the plug  so
  you can continue to use the phone (if connected).

(Gerald G) okay, what do you mean by removing the *plug* from the computer
  where is the plug? I got by printer on by the way.

(Sysop Tony) The plug is on one end of the direct connect modem cable.  It is
  a German plug, called a "DIN Plug".  It is about 1/2 inch in diameter, and
  about 2 inches long.  You can't miss it.

(Gerald G) okay, i will get the supplies, read the instructions and the ones
  given  here and give it another try. thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK... see you next week.

(HARRY (HAL) LYNDES) What is the best way to incease the mem in a M100 over
  32K?

(Sysop Tony) Buy expansion RAM banks.  They come in 32K, 64K, 96K, and 224K
  models.

(HARRY (HAL) LYNDES) What is the best way to add memory over 32 is price the
  only cosideration in relation to the size of the bank

(Sysop Tony) Don't know exactly what you mean by that question, Hal.  Price is
  relative to which one you buy and of course, from whom.  I'd think that
  delivery, and method of payment were more important to most folks.
  Expanding RAM is a common interest of many users, so we have prepared a file
  on the subject that covers much more than we can here.  See the file,
  EXPAND.RAM in DL13.  If you have a 102 See EXPAND.102.  If you want a LOT of
  RAM space, see BIGRAM.INF. OK?

(HARRY (HAL) LYNDES) thanks

(Sysop Tony) Now... about my vacation slides....
  I threatened to show them last week...

(Denny T) no! no! NOT THAT!!

(Sysop Tony) or at least describe them, if no one had any more questions.  But
  I see you've all been saved by Bill. 

(BillB) Am purchsing  DVI and want to know if I can  access to the screen of
  the monitor my Alternate ROM ?

(Sysop Tony) Probably not. .... but it depends.  Some ROM suppliers have
  versions made especially for supporting the DVI.  Some don't.  Some will
  work, some won't.  The DVI disk operating system must reside in high
  memory and grabs the system operating hooks.  attempts to use incompatible
  ROM programs will result in crashes.

(BillB) ROM in particular is  SUPERROM

(Sysop Tony) The answer to your specific interest is unknown.  The company
  has not supplied us with product samples, so unless someone is using that
  specific combination, there's no way of knowing.  However, Mike Anders, who
  is the company's online rep,  will get answers to such questions, when left
  on the message board....

(BillB) OK, thanks

(Sysop Tony) his user ID number is 70526,1715.  Any more on that, Bill?

(BillB) no

(Sysop Tony) OK.... ga Dana 

(Dana) Have there ever been any revisions to the DVI operating software from
  Tandy?

(Sysop Tony) Never that I know of.

(Dana) Thanks.  I have had good results downloading directly to disk with the
  TERM.ba program in the Tandy "portable computing with the M100"

(Sysop Tony) Yes... OK.   You might also like to try one of the Xmodem
  programs from DL3, which give you additional benefits.  XMODEM.312 is very
  basic but works well.

(Dana) Thanx

(BillB) With the price coming down to $250 the ownership of dvi must have
  increased. Do you think we'll ever get any 3rd party support for it?

(Sysop Tony) Actually, Bill, they're available for less than that.  But it has
  been rumored they are on closeout sale and that fits in with Tandy's
  previous methods of closing out a line of merchandise.  While more may be
  floating around,  we don't see many more DVI users here.

(Dana) It's too bad about lack of 3rd party support.  I talked a while ago
  with the fellow who runs Buddy Systems in New York

(Sysop Tony)  There hasn't been significant interest in supporting the
  DVI, even since it first came out.  Sorry about that. Any more?

(Dana) I still enjoy mine.  Use 2-sided disks for more storage.  It's very easy
  to set them up.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Curtis gets the last question, this week.  ga Curtis

(Curtis G) I need to know if there  is a program in the sig  that will allow
  the search of a chp file IE the index list without bringing it into ram

(Sysop Tony) There is a program written especially for that.  And we were
  talking about use of the INDEX earlier today.  See SEARCH.IND in DL9.

(Curtis G) Thanks Tony

(Sysop Tony) OK.... I must have been wrong.  time for one more question.
  Who wants it? OK.... no one.  In that case, I hereby declare this conference
  to be over.  Thanks for coming, and for your input.  We appreciate it.

  ***END OF CO***
