(Larry L) So, whats new with your M100?
(Curtis G) Not much, I've just been writing some new programs for use with the
 TWRIT software mostly
(Larry L) Like what? What is twrit
(Curtis G) It is a word processing software package by traveling software
(Denny T) [T-Word?]
(Curtis G) Yes I think so
(Larry L) Ah yes...I use superrom
(Phil W) pre T-WORD, in UR-1]
(Curtis G) I find super rom dosn't have all the features that TWRIT has
(Phil W) [TWORD *much* better]
(Larry L) Like what?
(Curtis G) Multiple line headers etc, automatic numbering of sub sections
(Larry L) I'm not a professional writer so I don't need all that stuff.
(Curtis G) Nor am I but I use it for reports and the like
(Denny T) Where's Dave & Tony?
(Curtis G) Don't know Denny
(Larry L) Shall we stage a Coup?
(Phil W) [Dave here when I arrived; gone now]
(Larry L) Hi JD how the Mag going?
(J.D.) All is well so far. Thanks to all who sent in addresses.

(Curtis G) I have a mod for the COLD program which call the ROM socket instead
 of the MENU
(Denny T) Good idea!
(Phil W) Not if you don't have a ROM installed, I'll bet!  We all have
customized it to our own needs.  Mine calls the PGD 0menu program!
(Denny T) It might be useful as a help file associated with Cold 
(Curtis G) Mine calls the Super ROM menu page

(RICH L) Where's the sysop today?
(Leonard E) Any ideas as to *Dave*'s whereabouts?
(Larry L) nope
(J.D.) [wrapping lame arm, perhaps?]
(Denny T) Probably his node got dumped
(GENE NESTRO) I think Tony was filling in as Dave had some sort of injury to
 arm
(Phil W) [He's on the phone, it seems (voice line is busy, I just tried it]


(GENE NESTRO) Anybody going to the Electromics show in Vagas?
(Curtis G) Who's show?
(Denny T) [CES]
(GENE NESTRO) I quess all will be there
(J.D.) Haven't decided. Usually not much of a show for computers unless you're
 a C-64 or Atari user.
(GENE NESTRO) ok I'll be there
(Curtis G) I won't
(RICH L) To far from Atlanta for me.
(J.D.) Lotsa robots & talking appliances, tho.... 
(Curtis G) Wonderfull
(GENE NESTRO) I'm from PA  


(Phil W) Anyone have info on this new Tandy drive, superceding the TDD?
(J.D.) News to me.
(RICH L) me too
(Curtis G) same here
(Phil W) Thread on SIG has limited info; Dave & Mel S.
(RICH L) Tell us what you know.
(Phil W) TDD  going down in price ($129?) after first of year. New drive to
 attach to 40 pin buss on 102/200 (what abt 100?), high density.
 that's all I "know" and I don't "know" that, even.  But those are the rumors
 as I recall them.
(Curtis G) Sounds like the DVI system of operation


(J.D.) [who's managing lineup??]
(RICH L) no one
(Phil W) [I will]
(Larry L) [honor system]
(Bill E) I thought Denny was
(RICH L) ok Phil...go for it.


(J.D.) Didn't think anyone would propose FOURTH disk drive "standard"
 at this point in 100's life cycle!
(Leonard E) Maybe RS made a deal for  Chipmunk?! (after fixing the bus prob)
(J.D.) (Whoops. FIFTH if you count PIC disk)
(Phil W) Hmmm I doubt it, but it could be.  I do think it is their answer to
 the bus issue of the 200/102.  But will it work with the 100.  Remember
 that Tandy only recognizes two drives, D/VI & TDD!
 The impact on those vendors who support the TDD as THE standard will
 be interesting to watch (if the rumor is true!).

(Sysop Syck) [Where is Tony?]
(Curtis G) Good question

(Jim A.) Uh, latecomer here. What rumor??
(Leonard E) Maybe it'll be a 3.5 DVI equiv drive.
(Sysop Syck) Can hardly type. But I'll download.
(Phil W) DAve, sounds like the arm is acting up.  We were discussing the new
 drive rumors re Tandy replacement of the TDD, as noted by you and Mel Snyder
 this past week.
(Sysop Syck) [lisen only]


(Larry R) Short of a cold start returning to new years day, 1900 as it were,
 how can one be sure that all remnants of a .CO that had been cloaded to BASIC
 are gone. I think Data Manager (from Tandy/RS) left some scraps in my
 machine's memory and I'd like to be sure. that sucker eats up room like you
 won't believe!!!!! 
(Phil W) Well, Larry, usually CLEAR 256, MAXRAM will do it. *but sometimes
 you even have to turn off the memory switch in the bottom to get rid of really
 tenacious stuff!
(Larry R) ouch!!!!! Wotta Bite!
(Leonard E) While I've never tried this, it should be possible to SAVEM the
 reserved RAM up to the dir, and then in a 2nd file the ram *after the DIR.
 A reload of these files would restore things.
(Phil W) Another thing I was going to mention is the use of FILEN to check what
 RAM usage is. In DL7 for 100, DL10 for 200.


(Jim A.) About this new drive rumor. Any info on that in the DLs?
(Phil W) Nothing in DL's as yet. Tandy keeps this type of data VERY close,
 so won't be until it is announced, I suspect.
(Sick sysop) [All I know: TDD going bye bye]
(Phil W) Any more Jim? 
(Jim A.) This is understood, but what rumors are known so far. Is it better,
 compatible or what?
(Phil W) Best data I've heard is that it will operate off system bus of
 102/200, be faster (therefore!) be high density (may be as high as 720K, more
 likely 360K all speculation on my part).  And TDD price is coming down to
 $129, I think.  That is it!!
(Jim A.) <sigh> They got me again!


(Curtis G) Ok back to the cold start, the best way to reset machine I know of
 is to do a CTRL BREAK + RESET together
(Phil W) Right, Curtis, but Larry's question (& he's gone) was on how to do it
 WITHOUT a cold start.


(J.D.) OK. Publishing news of questionable interest so I'll keep it brief.
 This past week saw many P100 staffers reunited at the Peterborough, NH offices
 of CW Communications, the mega-company that publishes 80 Micro, PC World,
 Computerworld, InfoWorld, and hundreds of other computer books. Seems that six
 months ago at Camden we produced the first issue of an annual buyer's guide to
 portables called PORTABLE COMPUTER REVIEW. It was sold to CW, and I spent a
 few days updating it and getting it polished for publication, along with other
 former Camden staffers. It will be out March 10, will include an article
 about Tandy laptops by Park M. Morrison, plus many other articles by familiar
 folk like Alan Zeichick and myself.
 Many, many copies out on the newsstand...may be worth picking up.
(Phil W) Sounds good JD. What is the scope re "Portable"
(J.D.) Everything from 4 oz. handhelds to a 38-pound transportable that runs
 VMS and supports up to eight terminals. But laptops are the clear focus.
(Phil W) Ummmm. what weighs 4 oz???
(J.D.) Handheld from Sharp.
(Phil W) Oh yeah, PC-2 et al.
(J.D.) Yeah, but happy to talk about LAPTOP USER ad nauseam, as always.


(GENE NESTRO) FLIPML.BA when run will list 'unknown file loaded .CO maybe if
 that file were dissected, a cold start utility could be prograded.
(Phil W) Gene, I didn't quite understand all of that but FLIPML will always do
 that the first time you run it if there is a CO file in HI RAM when you FIRST
 run it.  Usually the only risk is losing that file.
 FLIPML is pretty bombproof.
(GENE NESTRO) right, but u will know if any .co is resident, in this case
 Mltplan.
(Phil W) my last statement was that Mplan may affect the operation of FLIPML.
 Suggest you message Joel Dinda on this one, he is here a lot and will be
 helpful, I'm sure.
(GENE NESTRO) will do. TDD users, maybe all is not lost. Just think, the new
 drive bussed to the 100 and the TDD becomong drive:1!!! 
(Phil W) Welll,,, on that, since the 102/200 buses are different than 100
 may not be 100 compatible.  How about them apples!!


(R Caley) heard port 100 mag might be returning.
 I'll bet in relation to the new drive that tandy bought the chipper from
 holmes/pcsg. any comments?
(Phil W) WEll I doubt it, personally (not their style), but could be.
(J.D.) Promised December P100 is now the promised January P100. But the Camden
 folk are serious about getting the magazine up and running again. Only
 questions are about their ability to do so, not their willingness.
(PAUL LANDMAN) i asked them about a subscription and they said january it wil
 come back

(PAUL LANDMAN) looking through dl files and wonder if could pick your brains
 want decent bbs program for 102. any suggesions
(Phil W) There is a new program in DL3 which may meet your needs. It is called
 MESSENGER....
(PAUL LANDMAN) how big is it?? only have 24k
(Phil W) and you can find it by going to DL3  and doing BRO MSGRD


(RICH L) What was the name of the company that's putting out
 the new mag March 10th?
(J.D.) Rich, there are two publications being introduced in March.
 PORTABLE COMPUTER REVIEW is an annual buyer's guide to everything from
 handhelds to transportables that run VMS. It's being published by mega-company
 CW Communications, and you'll be able to find zillions of copies on newsstands
 everywhere. Other publication is a monthly for T100/102/200 users published by
 myself out of Salem, Mass. It will be called LAPTOP USER.


(Leonard E) I've just got a simple question. How do I reread masgs to me?
 I want to reply to a couple of msgs from aroound monday, but I forgot to write
 down the PPNs & names. Is there a way to read ALL msgs to me?
(Sick sysop) RS;T;70465,203;0
(Phil W) Try 'RS;T;<your ppn>' at the function prompt. That will get them ALL!
(Leonard E) will RS change the hi msg read pointer?
(Phil W) No 
(Leonard E) good!
(Phil W) hmmm maybe yes... Dave?]
(Sick sysop) METHINKS yes. but use HI command before and after using RS.
(Phil W) you can always reset in OP 
(Sick sysop) don't need to go to OP. HI works at Function.


(Marty T) I'm looking for a RENUM program. I looked in the DLs and only found
 one which didn't do the whole job. Then I found the one in the T-200 manual
 and it doesn't work. any suggestions?
(Phil W) I assuem you want one for the '200? 
(Marty T) yes
(Phil W) I am not a 200 owner. Anyone here have info on a good '200 RENUM
 program?
(Sick sysop) RENUM.100 and RESEQ.RY should work.
(J.D.) [Weird thought: load program as Multiplan worksheet??]
(Leonard E) [JD, no can do!]
(Phil W) Dave has a good idea.  In fact, TOOLKT in DL7 may work too.  No M/L
 or calls or peeks/pokes.
(Marty T) Thanks. I'll try those. I tried RESEQ.RY and it didn't change the
 GOTO,etc. statements.
(Phil W) Toolkt is outstanding and has other good features too.  But get the
 DOC too.


(John R) Anyone know of a good 110 BAUD portable modem for the 100/102?
(Leonard E) Any Bell 103 (ie 300 baud) modem will run as *slow* as you can send
 the data. I've used a standard modem at 50 baud! But what do you need 110 baud
 *for*? Many of the few things that still run that slow don't use 'normal'
 modems.
(Phil W) L, does that mean internal 100/102 modem will run at 110?
(Leonard E) Not unless you poke the new baud rate into the 8155 chip!
 M in the stat setting automatically selects 300 baud.
(John R) The Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf (TDD's) ...
(Leonard E) AH!
(John R) currently in use still run at 110 BAUD with 11-bit frames.
 Their default mode is BAUDOT, but all of the new ones will run ASCII as well.
 I have recently been taking a course in American Sign Language and wanted to
 know what additional modem(s) I would need. OK, how about suggestions on
 an external 300 BAUD modem for the 100/102, then?
(Leonard E) John, while I've gotten conflicting reports on just what tones are
 used in TDDs, one thing is sure. They are *not* 103 type modems. You will have
 to buy a TDD compatible modem. I once saw an ad for a TDD/103 modem (ie would
 work as normal modem and work with TDDs). Price was $300+!!! Suggest
 checking with local deaf groups for sources of TDD modems. when you
 find one lets us know!
(J.D.) I have a hazy memory of Portable 100 covering this topic as well,
 perhaps as a hardware project. Try (207) 236-4365 for a back issue.
(John R) Much thanks for the help. The Phone Company does give the signalling
 tones, etc., but I didn't have a 103 spec to compare.
 I will let you know what I find.


(DANA) What about Camden?
(J.D.) [question of the month]
(DANA) I just got the last P100 last week. Will they ever get going again
(Phil W) Dana, what do you mean? future of P100?? Guesses only
(DANA) That mag was a unique source for laptop ownewrs.
(Phil W) when they said they were publishing they often did not get to
 subscribers.  Now it looks like they may publish in Jan.  Wait and see!!
(J.D.) [shameless plug] You can always get a free subscription to Laptop User
 by sending your address to Shoestring Publications, P.O. Box 712,
 Salem, MA 01970. Be sure to list what equipment you use.
(Phil W) JD, what's in THAT name?
(J.D.) Grandiose ambitions have spoiled more than one publishing company in
 this market. "Shoestring" is a reminder to myself to keep things small.
(Phil W) sounds good.  But P100 did END on a shoestring!
(J.D.) Hasn't ended yet, Phil. But Camden launched or acquired at least
 six magazines and as many newsletters in 12 months. This strategy might have
 paid off if one or more of the new publications had taken off like a rocket.
 But they didn't, and P100 suffered as (at least an indirect) result.
(Phil W) Very true... and we suffered with them.
(J.D.) That's why "User" is part of the magazine title. Another reminder.


(DANA) Really enjoyed the music for the season in the DL.
(Phil W) dAna, did you read DAVES.PIK in the DL yet?
(DANA) not yet
(Phil W) TAke a look; good recommendations re music in that one! And a good
 concept for all the DL's (hint-hint, Dave)!
(Sick sysop) [for DL 6 ] [so far]
(DANA) Hope the sysop won't be sick for the holidays.
(Sick sysop) [chop off foot & arm, they won't hurt!]
(Phil W) Dave, tell us what is sick about you?
 Sick thing is he won't go see a Doctor! right Sick? 
(Sick sysop) fell, didn't bounce, arm & foot bad. doctor this week.
(Phil W) [tee-hee] Good!


(Phil W) Well, Dave -- bout time to close. You do the honors?
(Sick sysop) u'r doing fine. hate to take closing rites fm u.
(Phil W) OK -- well it's been fun, and thanks to all for joining in.
 Time to go, so Merry Christmas to all and to all a good day...
 but stay and play!
(Curtis G) Thanks Phil good job
(Sick sysop) many thanks fyll. merci milittanitos.
(DANA) happy holidays to all.
(Curtis G) Seasons Greeting to All
(jj) Especially sick sysops
