(Larry L) Hiya Tony...got your EMAIL  I seem to be having conflicts with
  other programs.

(Sysop Tony) What conflicts?  Some getting used to is required.

(Larry L) ok  I can't seem to get the macro to print. All I get is the first
  letter of the macro then the M100 freezes and I have to BREAK
  to get it back.

(Sysop Tony) Print where?

(Larry L) sorry ..say again..

(Sysop Tony) You say it won't "Print"... Print where?  On a printer?  On the
  screen?

(Larry L) Oh..  I tried it by hooking up to my Apple in  telcom mode..

(Sysop Tony) Aha!  Won't work!  The program expects the character to be echoed
  back by the receiving  computer.  The Apple won't do that.  It's optimized
  for use on CIS. 

(Larry L) ok  I think I can get the Apple to echo..will try that  Also...
  the Cancel program doesn't seem to really get rid of MACROS...It seem to
  overwrite the first line of the program I run after (DIRACC for example)

(Sysop Tony) CANCEL is designed to "disconnect" the call routines  from the
  TELCOM vector table, and kill the function key definition in
  BASIC.  I can't guarantee that it's going  to be fully compatible
  with other "trick" programs.

(Larry L) ok  How about trying a shell routine like in  Diracc..(you wrote
  that didn't you)

(Sysop Tony) No, I didn't write DIRACC.  I believe it came from Hugo Ferraya
  in South America.  I had enough trouble writing that as a first machine
  language project, without modifying it further.  it works as described,
  but may conflict with other programs.  Since I can't control how it will be
  used in each situation, you really can't expect me to be able to guard
  against all problems, can you?

(Larry L) No.  I will try it in an empty bank...thanks again.

(Phil W) [cummon, Tony -- walk on Lake TAhoe for us!]

(Sysop Tony) OK.... next week sometime...

(Jon Payne) Larry L, What kind of Apple do you have?.

(Larry L) [Apple IIGS]

(Jon Payne) ok never mind....done

(Larry L) [//e also]

(REX) HI FOLKS IM NEW HERE AND DONT KNOW THE PROTOCOL  SO BEAR WITH ME
  PLEASE CAN I ASK A GENERAL QUESTION?

(Sysop Tony) Rex... can you use lower case? Looks like you're shouting.
  The protocol is described in the file CONFER.HLP, which was mentioned in
  the greeting when you came in.

(REX) is this better?

(Sysop Tony) yep...thanks

(REX)  ill try again is this better

(Jon Payne) clumsy fingers?

(REX) yes

(Sysop Tony) Once you have been recognized, you have the floor  and don't have
  to ask if you can ask a question.  That's what you've been recognized for.
  Your question?

(REX) ok ill exit and read the file

(Sysop Tony) Why do that, now that you have the floor?  He's gone already!

(R Caley) Tony, I read your file on your  new macro program - pretty
  nifty. Have you got the program running  in TEXT yet??

(Sysop Tony) No.  It requires some major changes for use in TEXT.  We can't
  use the same technique.  So Martin Zimmerman and I are both looking at
  hooking into the keyboard scan interrupt, and  using that.  Each of these
  modifications is the equivalent of an entire ML program, by itself.  and
  have to be integrated to work together.  If we get the TEXT technique
  working, may even change the two previous versions.

(R Caley) ok  You might try looking at the  routines in PCSG's Write Rom
  LIBRARY feature... one more comment  I've missed you while you have  been
  gone..they have been using big words like "MAVEN" here..

(Sysop Tony) (grin!)  Well, that's Denny for you... probably speaks Jewish.
  PCSG has not provided me with any samples of their product,  from
  which I could do research of the type you mention.  And can't really steal
  technique from commercial products, anyway.

(R Caley) ok  I wasn't suggesting you steal anything, just that LIBRARY allows
  user to set up codes for text from 1 to 256 chrs, then when you print  it
  expands the text..I think it would be neat if you could get it to work  in
  your macro program..that's what I meant...

(Sysop Tony) Well  I have a philosophical problem in seeing how someone else
  does the job and trying to emulate it. ... MACPGM is original work, and no
  one can claim  I copied their idea.  Sometimes it's better not to have seen
  the other guys program, in case any question arises as to where it came
  from.   There are some commercial possibilities for MACPGM if we get it
  working.  We missed the boat on the spelling checker, you know.

(R Caley) ok  I'm with you. I detest piracy  it's just that your program
  iimplied that this was a possibility for TEXT.  I thought it was a great
  idea.

(Sysop Tony) It IS a possibility in TEXT, and I'm working toward that.  would
  be very useful  but it takes some time, since I'm just learning machine
  language, and this is my first program.  Also, I see it in a different
  application than PCSG sees it.  But working on it.

(R Caley) ok  You know, if you are looking for collaborators, Greg Susong
  is the best  ML programmer I know.

(Sysop Tony) Greg is no longer supporting the Model 100 family.  He's moved on
  to other interests, and has sold his Portable stuff to someone else for
  distribution.  I got the last assembler package he intended to ship. 
  (He said)

(R Caley) ok  No one "quits" the M-100!!!  He'll be back.

(Sysop Tony) Could be.  I wouldn't put money on it either way.  Let's see
  what Larry has to say.  ga Larry ga

(Larry L) OK...  I have been trying my hand at programming  and I need some
  help with PRINT.  Can anyone reccommend a book on the  subset of basic
  that the M100 uses?

(Sysop Tony) There are a lot of good books.  See the file BOOKS.001 in DL13
  for a list.  But what specific problem are you having with PRINT statement?

(Larry L) ok  I want to print a string,then a # with  Print using ,then
  another string..all on the same line.(it will fit)

(Sysop Tony) Is the string always the same?

(Larry L) yes...both..just the # changes..

(Sysop Tony) Try: PRINTUSING,"There are ### Slots left";N

(Larry L) ok  Thanks..that makes sense..will try it  I also have a request to
  everyone My program will very accurately compute  either the elapsed time or
  couter #,or interval time on a VHS tape..I need data  cooresponding to hours
  and counter #'s Eg.   1 hour = 456, 2=666 etc..Please send to
  73765,605..thanks.

(D.T. KING) YOU MIGHT MAKE IT VARIABLE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL USER.

(DaveW.) I think the variable is needed. It is my experience that each machines
  counter is slightly different.

(Jon Payne) some counters dont count length of tape... they count revolutions
  so the count will vary  depending on how far thru the tape you are.

(DaveW.) [Not always linear.]

(Larry L) ok  That's why I need the data.  The variables my equations are
  specific to the data numbers I put in.  The program that generates the
  variables is about 3 times as long as the timer program...When run,though it
  is VERY accurate througout the entire tape...SEND DATA to  73765,605

(Sysop Tony) You might want to set up your program so that a user times a tape
  once,  and puts his results in a data statement, thus making the program
  specific for his machine.

(Jon Payne) you made my point...  the data will need to be machine specific
  and will depend upon, rather vary according to how  far along the tape is.

(Larry L) ok. I like your idea Tony..If I get data that are near my #'s then
  there is no problem..If not then I will do as you suggest.

(RICH MINTZ) My first time in conference, was going  to ask what was being
  discussed, but I see you're wanting to go ahead with  another topic.

(Sysop Tony) Rich, we don't go over previous conversations for the benefit of
  latecomers... it would take too much time.  But we do provide a transcript,
  which will be in DL1 in a few hours.

(RICH MINTZ) ok.

(REGINA DENNIS) I HAVE A MEMORY PROBLEM.  IS THERE A WAY TO TRANSFER FILES?
  BOUGHT TWO EXTRA BANKS.  HOW TO TRANSFER FILES BETWEEN BANKS?

(Sysop Tony) What computer do you have?

(REGINA DENNIS) TANDY M200

(Sysop Tony) When you are at the main menu, move the cursor over a file name,
  And press the F4 button.  You will be asked what bank you want to copy
  the file to.  Type 1, 2 or 3, and away it goes.

(REGINA DENNIS) REALLY! OK. WILL TRY IT. THANKS A LOT

(Sysop Tony) Yours was an easy one to solve.  I use a 200 all the time.  Any
  more?  Or shall we move on?

(REGINA DENNIS) I LOVE MY TANDY 200 I'M AN ANTHROPOLOGIST AND TAKE IT
  EVERYWHERE.  I JUST NEED MORE SPACE FOR MY LONG REPORTS.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, don't we all!

(REGINA DENNIS) MOVE ON.

(Sysop Tony) OK... on to the next question.  ga MarkN

(markN)  happy easter all  I'd Like to find a way to do a "files"  command
  from basic and send output to a ram file,,,any ideas???

(D.T. KING)  The file info is in memory of M100 starting at  63842, it is in 11
  byte chunks the first byte tells if the file is active and what kind it is.
  4-11 have the name of the file.  Just write a simple basic routine to peek
  the info and send it to a ram file.

(Sysop Tony) I don't know why you'd want that, but it should be an easy  thing
  to do.  You should be able to convert either of the RAMDIR programs to do it
  quite easily.  But I seem to get the idea you want to do it with a single
  command?  That might be a little more difficult.

(markN) to be more specific, and change flavor entirely  I'd like to do a
  Lfiles command on a TDD w/ts-dos(ts-random).

(Sysop Tony) Well, that IS a bit different....
  However, we have just the program for that.  since TS-DOS didn't supply it.
  DIRLST.TDD in DL9 will do it.

(Phil W) Well, not sure I quite understand, but there may be a direct
  keystroke command in TS-DOS to do that.  Do you mean that or from within a
  running Basic program?

(markN) I know ya can do LFILES from basic  but not how to send output to
  file.

(Sysop Tony) Mark, as I said before, DIRLST.TDD was designed specifically
  to provide the same function as LFILES TO FILE command that POWR-DISK has.
  It copies the disk directory into a RAM file.  Exactly what you said you
  wanted.

(markN) yea,,,sounds good,i'll check it out  thanks tony ,,,,thanks all.

(Bill H.) ok  this is just so you wont get the slides out  If I do a control C
  while on CO will that louse anything up?  the reason  is that I could get
  some coffee and let the buffer hold the text until I returned.

(Sysop Tony) Somebody STOLE my slides!

(Phil W) [Denny]

(Sysop Tony) CTRL-C will take you back to the forum; CTRL-S might stop
  everything for you.  But can't guarantee it. CTRL-Q to restart.

(Bill H.) I was more concerned  about the CO.. freezing it  that is.

(Sysop Tony) No, what you do, shouldn't affect us.

(Bill H.) OK thanks.

(Sysop Tony) So, Phil.... you think Denny stole my slides?

(Phil W) Yeah ... he started to describe them a couple of weeks ago  in
  response to a tumultuous demand!

(Bill H.) haha

(Phil W) Odd, on the tariff thing -- virtually nothing in LA Times today  no
  info, no comments, nothing!

(Sysop Tony) Aha! That's probably where they went.  Oh, well.  On the tariff
  thing, perhaps it's now considered "old news".

(Phil W) Well, or maybe it is so new that the editorial writers haven't
  decided how to editorialize!  Notice that the head of Dept of Commerce
  Chicago office has decided to resign over this -- based on feeling
  strongly that it is contraproductive (produces Contras?)

(Sysop Tony) Well, that's a "Who cares?"  His action is like throwning a glass
  of water into lake Michigan.  Nobody's gonna notice, or give a damn.  I
  think we get the LA Times edition that's printed on Saturday, up here.
  Or maybe one printed by a satelite plant in San Francisco.

(Phil W) On another topic, are you still using rubber bands under your keys?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, they're still there.  Haven't rotted, or anything.  But only
  have them on the M100.

(Phil W) One or two per key?

(Sysop Tony) Lemmee see...  I think I put 2 on each key, 3 on NUM and ENTER.
  Don't remember the rest.

(Phil W) I did not like the feel all that well, so I took them off

(Sysop Tony) (Maybe not 3 on ENTER.)

(Phil W) But now I want to start using the M100 for taking notes in meetings
  so I'm going to re-install them.  Thot maybe one (vs. two) would make it feel
  better to me.  BTW -- when I installed them before, a couple of keys became
  intermittent.  Ever experience that?

(Sysop Tony) No, I've had no problems with them.  But there was another
  technique you might like to explore.  It was suggested to use a piece of
  felt, with adhesive on the back side; carefully punch holes in the felt where
  the key plungers go.  And install it over the entire keyboard.  Might take
  some laying out, or drafting ability, but as I understand it, Engineers know
  all the angles!  (grin)

(Phil W) Yeah, we sure do -- but have to make a map of the keyboard first
  since we can't spell QWERTY.

(Sysop Tony) And that's hard to pronounce, too... That's what Polaroid cameras
  are for.  (grin).

(Phil W) [job for my wife!]  re tariffs:  Big question for me will be whether
  Toshiba goes ahead with their screen upgrade program.  I bought one just 4
  days before they announced the new supertwist screen.  Great timing, huh!

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, great!  Murphy's Law.  But I found it quite interesting
  that you indicated that after the "newness" wore off, you've gone back to
  the Model 100.

(Phil W) Yes,very true -- tho I am using the Tosh just now due to the split
  screen software that I have for it.  M100 is much easier to travel with and
  I like the casual use of it (no need to boot disks, etc. to get started Both
  have a place in my normal use pattern now, but use M100 about 2 to 1.

(Sysop Tony) I got a chance to look at a Toshiba up here one day.  Don't know
  which model.... it was black, with a matte black screen, and
  orange letters.  About the same size as used on the T600.

(Phil W) Toshiba has split screen software available

(Sysop Tony) Split Screen software is not all that difficult! 

(Phil W) That is a 3100, has plasma display and 10MB hard disk; 80286
  processor in CMOS.

(Sysop Tony) It could be done for the Tandy 200 easily.  Maybe for the 100,
  too.  scrolling typed input on the bottom line.  and using the new /NOECHO
  capability of the CO software.

(Phil W) What is needed is to use bottom two lines (80 col total); Denny has
  it on his list for his muy grande Comm program.  Not so easy, I guess.

(Sysop Tony) Well, Denny is taking a different approach...  He'll get a
  "Grande" program up and running while I would whip up a short TELCOM emulator
  ...

(Sysop Denny) [boy, are my ears burning!]

(Sysop Tony) That would be set up to take advantage of the new software
  command.  Well!

(Phil W) Aha ... from under the rock comes...Denny!

(Sysop Denny) No, from out of the waterbed.

(Phil W) [gross!]

(Sysop Tony) California excess!

(Phil W) [Nevada negativism!]

(Sysop Tony) So, they say you stole my slides, Denny.  Wanna give them back?

(Sysop Denny) You were speaking of comm programs?

(Sysop Tony) We was discussing split screen TELCOM et al.  (I see he ignored
  my request to give back the slides!) (grin)

(Sysop Denny) Ah, the elusive split screen  <yep>  I figured out a way to do
  it Use two computers!

(Phil W) [some maven he turns out to be!]

(Sysop Tony) Hmmm... that's a possibility... send from one, receive on
  another.  But I think folks would like it more if they only had to use one.
   I was suggesting a scrolling line on line 8 for your keyboard input,  and
  /NOECHO in CO to suppress your input echo until finished,  at which time, it
  would "pop" off your line 8 onto the input lines, scrolling them up.

(Sysop Denny) Yes, that would be the plan, although Phil suggested that
  perhaps it should be two lines of non-scroll on the bottom for an 80 char
  buffer so you would be able to do a useful length line.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, but that reduces actual screen display to the point where
  you only see about two complete previous lines.  I looked at the 100
  screen while you was typing, and I saw only two complete lines displayed.
  And, new CO software allows lines longer than 80 characters.

(Sysop Denny) Right, but a one line display would possibly need a toggle
  between 1st and 2nd half of input. if you just overwrite...

(Phil W) [how about a scroll to the left?]

(Sysop Denny) after 40 characters, you're almost worse off than now.

(Phil W) [as in THINK.IT?]

(Sysop Denny) Hmmm.. that would be the other option - and also be able to
  scroll back to the right.

(Sysop Tony) I'd just make it a horizontal crawl.

(Bill H.) just gonna say that line 8 on my  102 is a dead line anyhow   just
  a curser blinking there.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah... ready for input.

(LARRY R.) If'n ya toggle the label line by pressing  label key on top row, ya
  gets one whole extra line!

(Sysop Tony) Yes, but the bottom line  either line 8 on the 100/102, or 16 on
  a 200 has nothing on it. The cursor just sits there waiting for input.  If
  your label line is on, then it sits on line 7.   Line 8 CAN be used for
  split screen software.

(LARRY R.) Split screen software?????

(Sysop Denny) Well, I was just going to say that  I have been able to lock
  line 8 out while online, and the only thing that  is needed now, is the
  software for input on that line.

(Sysop Tony) Yes... line 8(16) can be locked, so that it won't scroll.  All
  your input would appear on lines 1-7(15).   So you could put a horizontal
  scroll on line 8, for keyboard input,  probably by calling the routine that
  displays a character in A  at the cursor position.  That would also allow
  backspace to work.

(Phil W) This would be a real boon to CO'ing -- so get with it, Denny

(Sysop Tony) (Larry, you want to change the subject?)

(LARRY R.) Yes, but only slightly

(Phil W) gotta stop polishing your many Ports and move onto new  and better
  things!

(Sysop Tony) Denny, you gotta learn to live out of boxes, like I do. (grin)

(Phil W) [a project a day keeps the catery at bay!]

(LARRY R.) When offline, is there anyway to clean out that little  hidey-hole
  where the previous screen <f1> is stored from the online  session?  How much
  RAM does that little sucker hold???

(Sysop Tony) That area is also used by BASIC and other routines...  It is the
  exact same size as your screen buffer 320 bytes on the 100/102 and 640 on a
  200.  You can use it by poking stuff into it, but since it is volatile,  no
  guarantee what you put in will stay there long.

(LARRY R.) Thanks, I always sorta wondered.  New LU mag. has this article
  which described a call so you can take a peek at what's stashed there.  a
  most interesting collection of garbage, 4 sure!

(Sysop Tony) Constantly changing.  But folks have used it successfully  to
  store and execute ML programs, so they didn't have to be in the normal high
  RAM space.  Of course, when the program was finished the ML code was erased
  next time the buffer was used, but that's not a problem.  James Yi is a
  proponent of that technique, and he programs mostly for the 200.

(LARRY R.) That's all from me  for 2day, that is!!!

(Sysop Tony) OK... Looks like we're about at a wrap up point  Anyone have any
  final comments to make?

(LARRY R.) Club 100, as advertised in LU looks like a good deal.

(Sysop Tony) Well, I guess it's a good deal for "joiners". ... You DO get the
  magazine (which is free anyway) by first class mail; they seem to hold up
  everyone else's issue for a month before mailing it by camel pack.  But I've
  not felt it necessary to pay a subscription fee for use of a BBS, plus the
  long distance charges.  the other "perks" are questionable.

(LARRY R.) HMM!!!...

(Phil W) re earlier question --- one band per key seems to work fine!

(Sysop Tony) Modifying while we speak, Phil???

(Phil W) Yup!

(Sysop Tony) OK... well, we seem to be at a natural break here, so...
  Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's conference.  So I'll
  end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick around and chat further,
  if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we appreciate your input.
