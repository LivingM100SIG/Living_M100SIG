9:00 AM PST Sunday, March 29, 1987

(Sysop Tony) Good morning all.

(Howard Parr) I'm new at this and don't know what's going on

(Sysop Tony) Everybody wanna fix your handles and we'll get started?

(James l.) I enter f2, a file name enter  and get download aborts  just trying
  to download the ./help file what is wrong?

(Sysop Tony) After you press F2, what filename do you specify?  and,  Do you
  have any empty RAM when you try to download?

(James l.) I was using M100h  And how can i check file space on line...I do
  have ram enough...

(Sysop Tony) M100H should be a good file name, so that's OK  you can only
  check how much available RAM you have by being offline, or if you have  run
  one of the utility programs that puts that function on one of your function
  keys.  TELKEY.100 in DL3 will do it.

(James l.) what if my main  menu is full..will that cause problem???

(Sysop Tony) If your main menu is full, you have no space to download into.
  Let's see what Larry has to say.

(Larry L) ok  As far as RAM space noters...I can  reccommend TELUTL and
  DIRACC wholeheartedly  Telutl is short but Diracc allows use of TEXT and BASIC while online..

(Sysop Tony) Right! There are so many possible choices of what -can- be done,
  it's almost impossible to recommend any specific one.

(James l.) thanks...my was simply no space on the directory of main..

(Sysop Tony) OK... then on to the next Q.... ga Tim

(Tim B) Thanks  I have two items to dicuss
  First is the Laptop User  And the second is Wordstar <-> M100 file
  transfers But I really need to get Phil to another channel for that one
  First, I was really suprise to see what a fine mag. that J.D. had  put out I
  was expecting much less.  Especially when it is free!  I would like to know
  what y'all think.

(Sysop Tony) I haven't received one yet.  Anyone want to comment?

(James l.) how do you get it?

(Sysop Tony) See the file MAG.100 in DL13.

(Phil W) Well, I bought one at a newstand.  It is very nicely done.  On the
  plus side, good production quality, good range of coverage.  On the other
  side, ('member, I paid for it!) it seemed pretty non-critical and , for my
  taste, not technical enough.  BUT -- on the whole VERY positive!

(Sysop Tony) Are you sure, Phil?  The magazine is a controlled circulation
  publication, and is not supposed to be sold on stands.  I think what you saw
  is Portable Computer Review, Put out by the Portable 100 people, from left
  over stuff from last year.

(Phil W) Ah yes -- It was a Special edition -- I assumed because it was the
  first issue.  Was editted by JD.  But was a Special Issue.

(Sysop Tony) Yes. A number of folks have been confused by that.  Any more on
  that question, Tim?

(Tim B) I have a specific problem and I have talked about it until most
  peoples ears have fallen off, but here goes... If I bore y'all just let me
  know.  Let me try this with Phil and I get back OK.

(Sysop Tony) OK... See you in a while.

(Tim and Phil went off to channel 10 for a private chat)

(Sysop Tony) Meanwhile, on to the next question.  ga Howard

(Howard P) Is there another  DOS for the portable disk drive?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, several.  See the file DISKOS.INF in DL13, and follow up  by
  reading the files it points to.

(Howard P) How can I get ahold of one?

(Sysop Tony) Read the file in DL13, and it will give you that information.

(Howard P) Thanks alot. Thats all from me

(Sysop Tony) OK.... Kim is next. ga Kim

(Kim K) Ok, same area, any word on updates to DOS for TDD2?

(Sysop Tony) None.  No one has indicated any movement in that direction
  except Traveling Software who has modified certain programs for the new
  drive.  However, some of the old DOS's will work with the new drive.  See
  TD2TIP.001 in DL9.

(Kim K) I have an old drive, a new one and the DVI, is there any hope of
  compatibility among them all?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  Read the file TD2TIP.001 in DL9.

(Kim K) next question, I need to get a database system for an IBM AT or 386
  that I can access using the M100 as a terminal any ideas?

(Sysop Tony) The only thing I can recommend  is reading a file called
  REMOTE.IBM  in DL13, which is said to allow you to use the M100  as a remote
  terminal keyboard for the IBM.  I don't know if it works, or how to
  implement it.

(Kim K) Ok thanks much, I'm done..

(Sysop Tony) One more thing.  There is a remote program in one of the IBM
  forums, again, I don't know if it works, but Eiji has tried it  and you
  might send him a message to ask.  Eiji = 76703,4311.

(Gerald G) When you mention using the m100 as a remote for IBM does that also
  include the compatibles, e.g. RC Sx 1000.

(Sysop Tony) I don't know.  I simply don't have enough information on the IBM
  type computers to recommend anything there.  Maybe Phil would have some
  info He's still over in Channel 10, talking to Tim.

(Gerald G) If the need should occur trs80 pro would be a good place I assume.

(Mike H.) Am I right in assuming that any rom based dos software will conflict
  with existing m/l programs in ram?(for that matter disk base)

(Sysop Tony) No, I don't think so.  From what I've heard about the ROM based
  DOS of which SARDINE and Ultimate ROM-2 are the only examples  I know of,
  they don't conflict with anything in the computer.

(Mike H.) In particular Floppy on the tdd2?

(Sysop Tony) Well, I believe my previous comment stands.  But FLOPPY.CO is a
  big bag of worms,  and there still isn't enough information out on  the TD2
  version to make any definitive reply.  I'd recommend you get away from using
  FLOPPY.CO as soon as you can.

(Kim K) There's a definate problem between DVI and other DOS, as well as new
  FLOPPY and old DOS

(Sysop Tony) Yes, there is a definate problem  with multiple DOS's in the same
  machine.  They each want to use the system's hooks, and it can't be done.
  There are some programs in DL9 that allow you to  disconnect (unload) one
  DOS, and activate another.   Any more on that question, Mike?

(Mike H.) I wonder if anyone has tried disk power and the new dos,I heard they
  were compat. but i want to be sure.

(Sysop Tony) Read the file TD2TIP.001 in DL9  which deals with that question.

(Howard P) If I write a program that  accesses a file in another bank,  will
  it work?

(Sysop Tony) Only if you have that capability  as provided by the manufacturer
  of the bank that you bought.  PCSG has such capability, but I don't know
  about the others.

(Howard P) I don't understand.

(Sysop Tony) Well, if you buy a RAM expansion bank from PCSG they provide you
  with a ROM, or software,  which will allow you to access files in the other
  banks.  If you didn't buy PCSG's banks, then  you'll have to contact the
  manufacturer, and see if his banks have that capability.

(Howard P) So there is no way, with an as is machine to programmatically
  change ram banks?

(Sysop Tony) No, not with an "as-is" machine.  The original machine  doesn't
  know that you are going to insert extra RAM banks, or that you've done so.

(Howard P) Ok Thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... on to next question.  ga Mike

(Mike H.) On the sub. of m/l prog's. conflicting with each other, I have tried
  the prog. flipml in the dl's,it works but I still can't get the top,end and
  exec address for floopy on the new tdd2. I try loadm"flopp" and get ff
  error (no file)

(Sysop Tony) Mike... I don't have a TD2,  and don't know how FLOPPY loads
  there.  but my guess is that because so many folks complained  about FLOPPY
  in the TDD, that they changed it in the TD2 so that it didn't take up 7.5K
  of RAM space.  You might try this: Once it's in RAM, and operational, go
  into BASIC and type: PRINT HIMEM;MAXRAM.  Then remove FLOPPY, and type the
  same thing again.  Write down the numbers.  Consider the second set as #2.
  Reload FLOPPY, and then type:  SAVEM"FLOPPY.CO",(himem1),(maxram2),(himem1)
   and see if it saves to the menu as FLOPPY.CO.  If so, then go back to
  basic, and try LOADM"FLOPPY, and see if you get the addresses.

(Mike H.) Thanks that sound like the best approach.

(Sysop Tony) Question... how do you call FLOPPY to use it, if it's not on the
  menu?

(Mike H.) it is on the menu.  i wish i new that call address for basic though.

(Sysop Tony) As a .BA or as a .CO program?

(Mike H.) no extention tony.

(Sysop Tony) Well, that shorts me out.  They've totally changed it.  Until
  someone comes along with a TD2TIP to cover it, afraid I'll be in the dark.

(Mike H.) but strange thing  in the disk directory there is the file
  flopy2.sys.

(Sysop Tony) I'm afraid I can't help any further, Mike.... I'm just guessing.
   and what's on the disk is a whole unkown to me.  Sorry.

(Mike H.) Thanks i will try the method on getting the name change to .co.

(Sysop Tony) OK... good luck.  On to the next question.  ga James

(JAMES L. NUNN) I got the ./  help file after I cleared the garbage out of my
  menu but  now when I printed it  even though at width=120  i got only 40

(Sysop Tony) Probably, as the file is originally sent to you, it's sent as
  40-wide.  No matter what you do when printing,  it's still 40-wide.  You
  could change your terminal defaults.  in the PROFILE section to 80.

(JAMES L. NUNN) ok  how about the fact that with only 192 bytes left in
  ram...the transmission of help stopped during the Version details "...it is
  very useful to include the...[?

(Sysop Tony) How about that!  (grin)  I guess what you're asking, is "how come
  I still got 192 bytes left?"  

(JAMES L. NUNN) yes.

(Sysop Tony) That's part of the reserved system buffer that is used to store
  variables, and stuff.  You never...

(JAMES L. NUNN) how much did i miss???

(Sysop Tony) lose that.  It's always reserved and unavailable for your use. 

(JAMES L. NUNN) your text said five pages...how many kbytes is that?

(Sysop Tony) James, who are you talking to?

(JAMES L. NUNN) [ga?]  tony

(Sysop Tony) James.... I assume you dropped offline for a minute...

(JAMES L. NUNN) not me ga tony

(Sysop Tony) when you came back, you didn't reset your name.  we're getting
  your full name now.

(JAMES L. NUNN) what is ...standby

(james l.) better  what about  the length of the help file???kbytes?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know.  Don't have access to system information.  That's
  part of CompuServe's software, not a file I have access to, other than by
  downloading it.

(james l.) your text says it is five pages long  how much is that??

(Sysop Tony) "My Text"???? Where do I say that?

(james l.) in the intro to h

(Sysop Tony) I'm sorry, James.  Apparently we're not communicating here.  I
  haven't written any help file that's 5 pages long that I can remember.  I
  don't have access to the system's files,  so don't know anything about them.
   However, why do you want to  "download" such stuff?  Why not just echo it
  to your printer?

(james l.) good idea tony...thx

(Sysop Tony) OK... if no more on that  then on to the next in the lineup.
  ga Howard

(Howard P) What's the difference between the TDD and the TD2?  Just the DOS or
  did they redesign the hardware too?

(Sysop Tony) Howard, can you type shorter lines so we  know you're still
  there?

(Howard P) sure

(Sysop Tony) The TDD holds 100K, and the TD2 holds 200K on a disk.  And
  apparently it's DOS loads differently.

(Howard P) That all?

(Jeff Streutker) [don't forget difference in price]

(Sysop Tony) That's all -I- know about!  But then, I don't have one.  Let's
  see what others have to say. 

(Howard P) ok

(Sysop Tony) But Jeff, they were both originally $199.  The TDD only came
  down to clear them out before the TD2 came out.

(james l.) td2 is 199 in buffalo...when  will the price come  down???

(Sysop Tony) When the TD3 is released.  (grin).

(larry r) I have a TDD2 and am quite pleased with its performance  as a
  storage device/ram saver. I understand there is supposed to be a way  to
  mushfake one's way around the problem of downloading to disk from the modem 
  which I am currently exploring ( a local BBS claims to have something for
  it  but I haven't picked it up yet much less played with it)  Yet that's
  not that  big a problem 'cos with reliable external storage, I can just 
  clean out most of my RAM B4 goin' on line if I want to pick up a RAMload  of
  goodies for sorting out and playing with off line.  I've had no serious
  problems (REDIAL.JD2 fixed my disk drive/modem conflict bug) and am quite
  happy with it!  Others will, of course have other opinions as a rank amateur,
  I rank it pretty darn good!!!

(Sysop Tony) There are only two known ways to download to a TDD or TD2 while
  online. One is by "simulating" it; using an external modem, either to hold
  the line while you go off to use the disk, or by using the external modem
  for communications, with a switch to select the computer output, or by
  building a second RS-232 port that connects to the system buss, as described
  in the September 86 issue of 80-micro magazine.  If your local BBS has
  another way, I'd like to know about it.

(larry r) This SYSOP told me he had something what allows 4 the use of the
  internal built in modem. ga Tony take it away!

(Sysop Tony) I have something that allows use of the internal modem too
  it's called TELCOM.  .... Anyway if he has something useful, let us know.  I
  doubt he's come up  with anything shattering, though.  Too many smart folks
  have already tried it.  For a year and a half so far and although claims have
  been made, no one has yet done it.

(larry r) I'll let ya know.

(Sysop Tony) OK... would appreciate any new info so I'm not continualy sticking
  my foot in my mouth.

(Jeff Streutker) Tony, the help listing James  was talking about was what
  came when you typed H at the main promt... It recommends that you download
  it, and that it is 5 pages long Nothing about the size of these pages,
  but I guess it would be the size of a default page.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, and I repeat, that's a System File, and I have nothing to do
  with it.  But what, may I ask, is the size of a default page?  I'd guess
  that they expect it to be 300 lines long on a printer.

(Jeff Streutker) No,  I think it is 24 lines by either 40 or 80 characters.

(Sysop Tony) Then that would be about 120 lines.  It's all academic anyway  as
  James problem seemed to be that he was trying to download it into RAM, with
  insufficient RAM.  his question was, "How much RAM do I need to download 5
  pages?"  So, what is the definition of a "page"?  That depends  on what sort
  of "page" you're talking about.  A "page" of paper?  60 lines, ...

(larry r) 54!

(Sysop Tony) 80 columns?  A CRT screen "page"  24 x 80? ...

(larry r) 10 or 12 pitch?

(Sysop Tony) or an LCD screen page, 8 x 40?  It's a question  that can't be
  answered without defining the question further.

(Jeff Streutker) Right!  that's what I wanted to point out.  CIS is at fault
  here.

(Sysop Tony) Or "DEfault"! (grin) Well, there's always the complaint desk,
  GO FEEDBACK.  (grin)  But I don't think they'll listen.  OK...

(larry r) Y START NOW?

(Sysop Tony) let's see... Chris is waiting.  Any more on this before we talk
  to Chris?

(Jeff Streutker) no.  gone for the moment

(Sysop Tony) OK..... then you're up, Chris.  ga Chris

(Chris) Ok, First, How cheaply and where can I get 3 8k chips for my  8k M100
  (yes, 8k) and is there any diff between different RAM chips?

(Sysop Tony) Well, they average about $20-$25 apiece, and  there are several
  companies that sell them.   Expanding RAM is a common interest of many
  users, so we have prepared a file on the subject that covers much more than
  we can here.  See the file, EXPAND.RAM in DL13.  If you have a 102  See
  EXPAND.102.  If you want a LOT of RAM space, see BIGRAM.INF.

(Chris) Ok, is there anyway to dump to a cassette while online?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, but not from TELCOM directly.  You have to be running a
  terminal emulator program,  such as one of the XMODEM programs, that can
  address the cassette for output. ...

(Jeff Streutker) [TERM.BA?]

(Sysop Tony) XMODEM.312 will do it for you.  TERM.BA, recommended by Jeff, is
  one that you can buy from Radio Shack, but why buy when you can get better
  ones here by downloading them.

(Jeff Streutker) [true]

(Chris) Thanks, that's about all I've got for now.  I've been using this as a
  dumb terminal and printing everything I want to keep  It's a real (noisy)
  pain.  Thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK... I guess we covered that.  Any more Chris before we go on?

(Chris) none at all!  (thank you)

(Sysop Tony) OK... then ga Jeff

(Jeff Streutker) Are there any experts on POWR-DISK on board?

(Sysop Tony) Well, I have used it. ... Got a question?

(Jeff Streutker)  yes, I want to know how to back up a disk (PDD)  sector by
  sector, without using FLOPPY.CO.  Any ideas?

(Sysop Tony) As I recall, there's a backup utility in DL9 for the TDD disk
  system.  It is, or was, part of the DSKMGR  alternate DOS for the TDD.
  Exactly how it works I can't recall though, and don't recall if there is a
  backup utility that comes with Power-Disk.   I've only backed up  one TDD
  disk, and although I have about 30,  have never yet lost a disk, so don't
  bother any more.

(Jeff Streutker) Neither have I, but it's a matter of backing up the master
  disk which I have been unsuccessful in trying.

(Sysop Tony) Well, I've only used the Power-Disk Utility Disk one time.  To
  originally load the DOS from disk.  Never again, since.  I've never lost it.

(larry r) DON'T 4GET MURPHY!!!!

(Jeff Streutker) I sometimes had to do cold starts, and that's why I need it.
  anyways, go on to next in lineup.

(Sysop Tony) Do you have any extra RAM banks?

(Jeff Streutker) I only have the RS chips up to 32 K.

(Sysop Tony) OK  If you get at least one extra RAM bank, you can "store" stuff
  there and when you cold start the main bank, reload from the storage bank.
   That way you don't have to start over from scratch.

(Jeff Streutker) This info in BIGRAM.INF?

(Sysop Tony) BIGRAM is a lot of $$$ and a lot of RAM for storage.  7 extra
  banks.  1 extra bank would do it.  And a single bank  can be had on the used
  market for about $50.

(BILL HEIMAN) comment !

(Jeff Streutker) you'll have to tell me about where info on extra banks are.
  never heard of the subject.

(Sysop Tony) Well, start off by reading EXPAND.RAM in DL13, and go from there.
   Let's hear from Bill.   ga Bill

(BILL HEIMAN) I just installed  Nodes  256k rambank two days ago..and  it
  seems to work fantastic.

(Sysop Tony) Well, the NODE RAMBANK is a different animal.  And, over $500....

(BILL HEIMAN) negitive

(Sysop Tony) But any extra RAM bank can be used to store...

(BILL HEIMAN) about $1.00 per  k of ram  they have a 36 k for abt  50 dollars

(Sysop Tony) Bill... if you're going to continue a conversation,  then don't
  end your sentences with "ga" as I take that to mean you're through.  Let's
  sort this out. ...

(BILL HEIMAN) sorry my mix up

(Sysop Tony) PCSG has a 256K RAM bank of 7 extra banks for over $500.
  NODE has a 256 bank of continuous RAM which is used primarily for
  storage.  But this is all above Jeff's needs.  He wants to know how to
  reload Power-Disk. ... So let's get back to the  original concept here.  He
  can store Power-Disk in ANY, repeat, ANY, of the RAM banks.  Which he choose
  is entirely up to him.  Again, I recommend reading EXPAND.RAM in DL13,
  and go from there.

(larry r) OK  If you can only use 32 K at a time  what is the advantage of
  blowing 500 bucks on 7 banks if all you can access at 1 time is only 32 K?
  Or am I misunderstanding something??

(Sysop Tony) Good question. .... Why spend $500 on extra RAM,  when the
  computer may have only cost $300?  Some folks use the extra banks for
  different purposes.  Such as 1 for business, 1 for games, 1 for
  telecommunications 1 for memos and schedules, 1 for ... and so on.
  Personally, I'd opt for a Chipmunk disk drive, as 1 disk is the equivalent
  of a dozen extra RAM banks.  3 disks = over a megabyte of storage, and
  programs can directly access the disk files.  So much better it's pitiful to
  consider any other options.  (For the money!).  The TDD buyers who get a
  drive, then spend more money to make it more than a simple storage medium
  are missing the boat, in my opinion. ...

(BILL HEIMAN) Tony do you understand how the node bank works ?

(Sysop Tony) By the time you buy a TDD, and software, and an extra modem, to
  be able to download to disk, you could have bought a Chipmunk.  Trouble is,
  when it's full, it's full!  With a Chipmunk,  When one disk is full, you
  put in another.

(larry r) ok.  is there a file in any DL which does a comparison of these 
  various options, especially disk drive features? if so its name and location?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, several.  All in DL9 or DL13.  But I've been preaching the
  better value of the Chipmunk for two years, and very few folks listen.  They
  get a TDD because it's "on sale", without regard to what it's capabilities
  are.  But that's all my editorializing for today.  We have a couple more
  questions to deal with today, and very little time.  In fact, almost none.

(DAVID E) [i got mine because I could CHARGE IT]

(Sysop Tony)  See! an exact example...

(Sysop Tony) (We're running over today, folks. )  Go ahead, Dana,

(Dana H.) How does the Chip's operating system compare to that of the DVI?
  (device address...) and amount of memory used.

(Sysop Tony) Basically the same, but Chipmunk is superior.  Random access is
  only one example.  I don't recall how much RAM the DVI DOS uses, about 4K
  I'd guess...

(Dana H.) 4697

(Sysop Tony) CDOS uses 5K, but is reloadable by pressing the reset button.  So
  you can kill it, and reload it at any time, very conveninetly.

(Dana H.) Interesting.  Those 360 K disks are appealing.

(Sysop Tony) I'm very satisfied with mine.  Using it right now to download the
  CO transcript.  The TDD will never match the Chipmunk capability  but the
  Chipmunk is best used with a M100,  It CAN work with a 200, and 102, but
  with limited capability due to machine differences.  (200 can't download to
  disk and 102 needs machine modification) Let's hurry along...

(DAVID E) Mine is more of a comment from last week  The reason I don't use the
  index files is because you don't know what the program does.  only the name.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's a shortcoming of the INDEX.  But that's what an INDEX
  is for; to tell you where to look for the information.  The CAT files are
  more informative, but also much more space consuming, and cost more $$$ to
  download.

(DAVID E) With keyword though  you would at least have an idea what they do.

(Sysop Tony) Do you have a copy of "The Best of" for this forum?

(DAVID E) yes    that is what i found the best to handle it as
  but you said it was a 1 a year thing.

(Sysop Tony) OK... what they did there, was make the index, based on keywords. 
  listing the files that the keywords referenced.  Every file that used the
  keyword "Disk" was listed under "Disk".  The purpose of OUR index is to tell
  you where the file is located,  who wrote it, and how big it is.  A "Keyword
  Index" is something we haven't even considered, because it would have to
  cross reference not only the file names,  but also where they are located.
  The present index is over 80K.  A keyword index would EASILY be over 400K.
  NO ONE has the time and $$$ to download that, and keep it updated.  We are
  just now developing a way to update the current INDEX files.

(DAVID E) Agreed with the time and $  but with the prog you are creating the
  cross ref is done by the prog and if only one major keyword  was used then
  at least you can guess whether it is  usful to you.

(Sysop Tony) Which keyword would you select as relevant?  Of the 8 or 10 left
  by the authors, which often aren't relevant at all.  Example: "THIS PROGRAM
  RUNS ON A M100".  What's the "keyword" here?  Let me point out, that
  CompuServe provides no index capabilty at all,  and what we're providing now,
  takes time and effort to produce.  If you'd like to develop a different type
  of index system, and the programs to develop it, we'd be only too happy to
  use it.  But don't expect US to do more than we're doing now.  Eiji spends
  almost full time updating the indexes and catlaog files for you folks now.
  There's no extra time to develop something new.

(DAVID E) I agree and am very thankful for the time and  effort put in to this
  sig.  I has been a very big help to me and I don't wish to jepordize its
  time for helping others.  THANKS

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Well, we have run well over our allotted time this week...
  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick around and chat
  further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we appreciate your
  input.   Bye.
