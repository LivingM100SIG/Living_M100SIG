(Phil W (Host) Hi, Arthur.  You may want to do '/han Art B' or some such to shorten...
your name before things begin.

(ARTHUR BENSON) ARTHUR BENSON

(Phil W (Host) Let's see. Some advice.  Always a good idea to read the HLP...
files in DL1. CONFER.HLP is the one for CO's.  Always good to shorten...

(ARTHUR BENSON) HELLO

(Phil W (Host) name as in '/han Phil W.'.  '/ust 18' will tell you who else is here...

(ARTHUR BENSON) PHIL, DO YOU HEAR ME

(Phil W (Host) Keep lines shorter than 79 chars (I HEAR YOU).  And please make sure...
(Phil W (Host) caps lock is not depressed.  Send 'ga' to show the end of a messages....
and dots to show continuation. ga

(ARTHUR BENSON) alright. as you can see this is the first time i have done this.

(Phil W (Host) So I guess it's time to really start this thing....

No special topic for today.  Your choice.

(ARTHUR BENSON) i logged specifically to try to find out any info
(ARTHUR BENSON) info about the portable 100 magazine.

(Phil W (Host) Well it looks like they will be back in publication, sometime soon....
they have not sent out an issue since August 1986...

(ARTHUR BENSON) i sent money for a subscription and i 

(Phil W (Host) and in late 86 I believe they did a Chapter 11.  But now they are under new...
ownership...

(ARTHUR BENSON) have never gotten a mag nor cani

(Phil W (Host) Please wait until I do a 'ga' to reply. ga

(ARTHUR BENSON) get a hold of anybody there ga

(Phil W (Host) When did you subscribe? ga

(ARTHUR BENSON) august 86 ga

(Phil W (Host) Well, there is a new team in charge, and I believe it is their...

(KARL E. RASCHER) HI!

(Phil W (Host) intent to honor all old subscriptions. ga

Send a "Q" to get into speaking lineup (question or new topic) ...
Send a "C" to comment on the current topic.

(R Caley) [Hi all]

[topic: Portable 100]

(Phil W (Host) Does that take care of it, Arthur?

(ARTHUR BENSON) yes ga
(ARTHUR BENSON) i am just going to listen

(Phil W (Host) OK.  Then GA Rush ga

(R Caley) ok...
(R Caley) Just want to say that I would be extreeeeemly careful....
(R Caley) about dealing with CW Peterborough...
(R Caley) You're likely to lose your money......
(R Caley) I want Laptop User back!! AAAAAAAArrrgh

(Phil W (Host) Well, I tend to agree, Rush -- based onpast performance....
Of course, LU has done a real vanishing act -- but they did try...
on a Shoestring! (grin) ga

(R Caley) that completes comment....I have a question later..ga

(Phil W (Host) Well, go ahead with the question -- you are next in line! ga Rush ga

(R Caley) ok...
(R Caley) I was talking with "TV" Gordie over at TSI....

(Phil W (Host) ["TV"?]

(R Caley) and he was telling me about this new 2 meg expansion RAM of theirs...
(R Caley) Do you know anyone who has seen one yet? They look CHEAPER...
(R Caley) than the one by Soundsight....
(R Caley) "TV" gordie is a nickname I gave him    

(Phil W (Host) Well, the project is in beta test now, I understand....
and there seem to be a number of competing products with a meg of RAM...
or more.  I do know quite a bit about it.  It (Booster Pak) is more...
than just RAM, but an integrated system to expand the Model 100...
or 102.  Can include a modem, Sardine, several ROM's (up to 8...
I think), etc.  The new TS catalog has a fair amount of info,...
and of course, price data.  Price is very attractive....
I don't know much about Soudsight.  and a recent (yesterday)..
message from Jime Putnam says he has received the Vault from...
PG Designs.  Now someone will hav to sort all of this out re...
comparative features, etc.  Hmmmm, who will buy all and test? ...

(R Caley) [Tony]

(Phil W (Host) Challenge for Portable 100? <grin>. ga Rush ga

(R Caley) ok..
(R Caley) Thanks...it sounds to me like they have hit on something nifty...
(R Caley) I STILL want to know why these guys with all the smarts....
(R Caley) can't figure out a way to allow Users to access files in their
(R Caley) Mega Rams etc. to edit files...
(R Caley) larger than 32K!!!. Ga

(Phil W (Host) Well, I believe PG Designs (Peter van H) told me that Vault would let...
that be done, and that he may have a S/W product to let current...
Model 100 PG RAM owners do the same.  We will see!. ga

(R Caley) Youre right...
(R Caley) WSSWWSS.....
(R Caley) That is short for we shall see what we shall see.ga

(Phil W (Host) Ok.  All done on this one, Rush? ga

(R Caley) yes..ga phil ga

(Phil W (Host) OK then ga Joshua ga

(joshua) I came in during the port.100 question ...
(joshua) Do you mean I may get the three issues that were left out of my subscription...
(joshua) That i really doubt...
(joshua) And has Laptop User reached the end of its shoestring? After (for me) 1 issue?

(Phil W (Host) Gee, so do I!  But the eager "new" management suggested that....
see the files P100-A.THD & P100-B.THD in DL 13 for....
the discussions on the Forum at that time.  RE Laptop User....
there were two isssues, tho only a few of us got the second one...
A prominent Model 100 author/software developer has reported...
a couple of bad checks in a public message here, and J.D Hildeberand...
has been completely incommunicado.  Draw your own ....
conclusions re LU! ga

(joshua) I'm done!! ga

(Phil W (Host) Oh-Oh -- time for Tony's slides so soon? Qustions anyone, on any topic? ga
(Phil W (Host) go Karl ga

(KARL R) Hi, I am new to the SIG, so this question may have already been asked...
(KARL R) but here goes.  I just got the PDD2 and need to know how to save ML programs...
(KARL R) loaded from cassette.  Any suggestions?

(Phil W (Host) Well, when you...
load them from cassette, you then must (in Basic) do ....
SAVEM "FILE", TOP, END, ENT  where these are the three addresses...
the cassette load gives you.  That puts it on the menu as a CO...
file.  Then you save it to disk just the way you save...
any file on the M100 menu.  Let's see if Rush can clarify that! ....

(R Caley) ok...
(R Caley) You do not necessarily need to...
(R Caley) save the file to RAM as a COmmand file....

(KARL R) I tried that, but when I loaded the file from CAS:....
(KARL R) it killed floppy.CO

(R Caley) You can load the file from cassete...
(R Caley) WAIT KARL!

(Phil W (Host) [yes, Karl -- Rush has the floor!]

(R Caley) load from cassette as Phil said: Cloadm"Filename...
(R Caley) The file will load and produce on the screen the 3 addresses...
(R Caley) Then in BASIC type: SAVEM"0:"filename",xxxxx,yyyyy,xxxxx.....
(R Caley) This will save it to the disk...without placing in RAM......
(R Caley) However, DON'T FORGET to....
(R Caley) Type Clear0,Maxram afterwards because the CO file is loaded...
(R Caley) into the computer's memory, and if you forget,...
(R Caley) you could conflict at a later time and get "THE BIG CHILL"....
(R Caley) which will give you a visit to 1/1/1900..GA

(Phil W (Host) Karl....
You may want to leave a short message in the forum...
and get soem more detailed thoughtful help there (hard to cover it all...
in the on-line mode).  But loading from CAS kills the high memory version...
of FLOPPY.CO, not the menu version -- which then has to be reloaded....

Now a query for you, Rush -- does FLOPPY for the TDD2 support...
the 0: syntax -- or are you assuming a third-party DOS? ga Rush ga

(R Caley) ok...
(R Caley) I have never used a TDD2...but I just ASSumed that...
(R Caley) the device used the "0: syntax like the DV/I, chipper, and TDDI...
(R Caley) I may be wrong.ga

(Phil W (Host) Well, I've never tried it.  Does 0: work with FLOPPY and the TDD1?? ga Rush ga

(R Caley) I'm sure(?) it did when I used one, but maybe I was dreaming....
(R Caley) I was Beta-Testing TS Random at the time. I don't own..
(R Caley) A tdd1 anymore...don't like them. Sorry for the bad info..ga

(Phil W (Host) Probably not!  0: support is the primary raison d'etre for ....
TS-DOS, POWR-DOS, et al.  Anyway Karl (at last!) did that cover it?? ga

(KARL R) Well, I hope so.  I'll try the 0: syntax and see what happens....
(KARL R) Sorry for interrupting, like I said, I'm new, but it won't happen again ....
(KARL R) I'll sit back and listen now.  ga

(Phil W (Host) Ummm..no problem! And keep coming with questions...
Gary, did you have a comment on this? ga
(Gary D.) yes.....
(Gary D.) Karl, I have a "quick" way to handle your problem.....
(Gary D.) the 0: syntax won't work, but I don't want to tie up the conference, so.....
(Gary D.) I'll Email the solution to you later today, if that's O.K.? ga

(Phil W (Host) Gary!  Tell us, too! <grin> ga Karl ga

(KARL R) Thanks Gary, Email sounds fine. ga

(Gary D.) Phil.....
(Gary D.) it's just the 2 short one-line programs....
(Gary D.) called "DISK" and "CLEAR"....
(Gary D.) Clear keeps FLOPPY in memory, but clears Himem so as to allow running other....
(Gary D.) CO stuff. So, he uploads his other CO program, saves it......
(Gary D.) and then "Clears"...he can now use FLOPPY to save....
(Gary D.) the new CO to disk. I do it all the time with no problem! ga

(Phil W (Host) Good.  You know, when you've been using a Model 100 for four years...
it's easy to forget how peculiar the memory structure is...
BTW -- the conflicts in high RAM have led to development of  a version...
of DSKMGR which will load below other resident "stuff", to any address...
It is in DL9, and called DSKMGR.REL -- a Basic loader.  Unfortunately...
it supports the original TDD only, at least I have not heard...
reports of DSKMGR working with the TDD2.  ....
Now Gary, did you have a nother topic? ga Gary ga

(Gary D.) Wait, Rush!!!!
(Gary D.) Yes....
(Gary D.) question for Rush.....
(Gary D.) I still can't get in touch with the guy who has the Backgammon program....
(Gary D.) for the Model 100! Any ideas? ga
(Gary D.) Well....

(Phil W (Host) [Gone!]

(Gary D.) UST shows Rush already left!....
(Gary D.) Anyway, I'll keep trying and, now....
(Gary D.) I gotta run too! Karl, I'll send the...
(Gary D.) Email in 'bout an hour! See y'all! ga

(Phil W (Host) Bye, Gary.
Well, drag out the slide show again!  Questions anyone?

(joshua) Let's see the slides!! I've got no questions. ga

(KARL R) No more questions here. ga

(Phil W (Host) Hmmm...didn't load up the slides today!

(joshua) Awwww gee whiz!!

(Phil W (Host) will comment a bit on the cassette issue...
There are recent messages on use of the cassette in conjunction...
with TDD for backup -- which will soon become a THD file.  What is...
needed is a program which will AUTOMATICALLY take a file from disk...
and write it to cassettte -- and the reverse.  That would solve...
Karl's problem neatly, and would let us back up an entire disk....
to cassette for archival purposes.  POWR-DOS has a ...
utility that does so, but on a sector basis, so that the resultingg...
tape needs POWR-DOS's COPY-C to reconstruct the files ....
and only on disk, not in RAM.  One...
thing we are missng is a non-commercial...
OS that will support the 0: structure needed to work the disk from...
within a program. ga Joshua ga

(joshua) Off the subject a little: I know it's possible to download from the modem...
(joshua) to cassette. Do you have any idea how much that slows down transmission...
(joshua) speed? Not having a workable disk drive combo. Yet.  ga

(Phil W (Host) Gee, have not tested it.  But my impression is that at 300 baud...
it would not slow down much and at 1200 baud it would slow down a fair...
amount.  And a disk drive is not a panacea.  Download to TDD is ...
generally not feasible (see DOWTDD.THD, DL9).  But with a Chipmunk...
no problem.  BTW, with the TS Booster Pak, you get a HUGE RAM disk...
and can download very large (>32K) to that.  On Karl's issue...
TAke a look at the files FLIPML.100 &FLIPML.DOC in DL7...
the doc discusses the memory conflict issue and the program is a nifty...
way to solve the problem. ga

(joshua) I'm gonna head out. Talk atcha later, bye

(Phil W (Host) OK, Joshua. TKs for coming!

(KARL R) Sounds good.  I'll take a look at them.  ga

(Phil W (Host) Well it's about time for my unpublished poetry (vs. Tony's slides).

(KARL R) Can we see the slides, pleeease?

(Phil W (Host) Trouble is that they are in My M100, and this is not it! ga

(KARL R) Rats!

(Phil W (Host) Do you have the TDD2 Karl?

(KARL R) Yes, I do.  I got it about a month ago.  ga

(Phil W (Host) There are some files of special interest to you in DL9....
go there and do BRO TD2TIP.  Some nifty things....
including an apparent capability for sector-level access. ga

(KARL R) Sounds Interesting.  joshua mentioned downloading to CAS.  Some questions, ....
(KARL R) How is it done, and are'nt you still limited to 32K?  ga

(Phil W (Host) Hmmmm, a good question.  As a practical matter you are limited to 32K...
actually less -- since you would need to load the file to the M100 to...
use it for anything.  But it should be possible to write a program to....
open a CAS file for input and LPT for output and print directly...
from the CAS file (and I'm sure the various print pgms in DL2 support...
doing that)....
So far as how to download to CAS, I believe you would need to use one of...
the XMODEM or othere terminal programs.  But I've never tried it! ga

(KARL R) Like I said, I'm new so I haven't had much time to look around yet. ....
(KARL R) The CAS to LPT program crossed my mind too.  ga

(Phil W (Host) I'm sure it exists.  Yes, re being new, this place has got to be...
mind boggling.  When I started here there wer a few hundred files...
in the DL's.  Now I've uploaded that many myself, and the total is...
around 3000.  Hard to know ewhere to begin, I imagine! ga

(KARL R) Yeah,  I have had my 100 for about a year and 1/2, and had been mostly using ...
(KARL R) it as a keyboard with memory to upload to an IBM PC, but now I'm starting to ...
(KARL R) use it more in and of itself.  I figured that this SIG would be a good place...
(KARL R) to get help, and hopefully a few good programs.  ga

(Phil W (Host) I really believe that this is the BEST place to get Model 100/102/200...
support. It has been consistent, where the mags (except PICO) have...
not.  And there is no printing delay! <grin>.....
BTW -- if you use the M100 with a PC, take a lookat FLTIBM.DES in...
DL3.  FLTIBM is a small PC pgm (1200 bytes) which supports M100 - PC...
transfers at 9600 baud, fast and very easy to use. ga

(KARL R) Sorry!!!! I didn't realize it was the BEEEST!!! <grin>....

(Phil W (Host) (beast or best!!)

(KARL R) Right now, I'm just using TELCOM and CROSSTALK at 9600 baud.  It works ......

(LARRY R.) HELLO!!!!

(KARL R) pretty well.  [Best]

(Larry R.) I guess...

(Phil W (Host) Ah but kludgy, compared to FFLTIBM (now, guess who wrote FLTIBM!).....

(Larry R.) the formal CO is over??? ga

(Phil W (Host) Not really, just getting very intimate! ga Larry ga

(Larry R.) When I use XMODEM...
(Larry R.) (I believe it was XMODEM.312, 2B more...
(Larry R.) precise)...
(Larry R.) and am not using an auto log on sequence...
(Larry R.) I find that the program will hang up on connection and I have to shift-break...
(Larry R.) or some such to get it to move me into...
(Larry R.) straight TERMINAL mode...
(Larry R.) as I haven't gotten the knack of...
(Larry R.) writing good (df. ones that WORK)...
(Larry R.) autologons for the few places I have...
(Larry R.) to use xmodem, this is a problem...
(Larry R.) GOT ANY GOOD TIPS? GA

(Phil W (Host) 'Fraid not, Larry!  I am a dyed-in the wool X-TEL user....
and I have not spent much time with XMODEM series here....
Best bets are Tony and Denny (or Leonard Erickson)...
since they are currently dealing actively with XMODEM series...
questions on the Forum.  Sorry! ga

(Larry R.) RATS...
(Larry R.) It was worth a try...
(Larry R.) CUL8R! ...
(Larry R.) <<<<<<<<<<<<<< POOF >>>>>>>>>>>>>

(Phil W (Host) Well, Karl, it's just you and I again.  Do you have another topic...
or shall we call it a morning? ga

(KARL R) No, I guess not.  Thanks for all of your help.  I really appreciate it.  ga

(Phil W (Host) Glad to help, and thank YOU for keeping me company!

(KARL R) Auf Wiedersehen!

(Phil W (Host) In the words of MacArthur, I hereby declare these proceedings closed!..
Ta TA (less prosaic words!).
