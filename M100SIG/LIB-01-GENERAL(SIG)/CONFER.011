10:55:34 AM EST Sunday, January 5, 1986

(Sysop .^Dave^.) This morning there is no topic, with matters discussed of
  YOUR interest. And would you LOOK who is here from Germany??
  Welcome back ROBI !!! Still with PCSG??
(ROBI) Still friends but not active....
 I won't stay too long but did want to say Hi from over here.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Coming in from Germany Robi?? Or are you stateside today??
(ROBI) At home here in Rodenbach, FRG.

(larry l) i'm buying a 128k ram; when i install do i turn off memory switch?
(Mike A.) The 128K fits in without power down, but it's best to make a backup
  of all present files, just in case.
(larry l) just wanted to know if i should dump my programs before installation.
(Mike A.) Definitely !
(John) could someone describe the physical setup of the 128?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, perhaps the picture in magazines shows it well.
(Mike A.) It's a rectangular circuit board that fits into the expansion area
 underneath the 100.   You hide it away and forget it. Each bank stores 32K
 apiece, but you can program from bank to bank
(larry l) mike..is there a rom under bd(not shown)?
(Mike A.) No, but a ROM does fit in the socket it contains the bank switching,
 copy software
(larry l) mike..i meant to control the mem?
(Mike A.) er, not that I know of

(larry l) to Robi...i am ging overseas with my 100..
 how easy is ti to hook up to cis?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See the ABROAD.HLP file in DL 1.
(ROBI) it depends where you are....
(larry l) robi..israel??
(ROBI) you can prob call direct long distance from anywhere but costs more.
 I use packet switching from the Getman telephone company

(victor milt) I'm transferring files from my 100 to a tandy 2000 via a null
 modem / rs232 and all is ok; but now i need the files again on the 100 and
 I am getting I/O problems. Help???
(Phil W.) What OS are you useing on the 2000?
(victor milt) open acess; it all works on compuserve and if i turn the mod100
 on and off again fast, i'll get a single letter on the 100
(Phil W.) repeat -- which op syst em on 2000? ms-dos? 
(victor milt) MS/dos SPI Open Access
(Phil W.) FLTIBM may work; but I lthink the I/O stuff needs changed for 2000
(ROBI) old 100's don't have high enough voltage on the RS232 for the 2000.
 may need hardware fix
(victor milt) Ah HA!!! should i get a new 100??
(hjb) victor, what are you doing at the 100 end?
(victor milt) just the usual rs232/ telcom program; all files will go to the
 2000 ok but wontthe file open but no communication takes place to the 100...
(hjb) have you tried opening a file in Text?
(Phil W.) suggest you put up a message describing exactly what you do (on sig)
(ROBI) I think RS has a fix for old 100's
(victor milt) I'm leaving for germany on wednesday and need these files
 is that fix physical??
(hjb) do it this afternoon; Phil and I will both respond
(victor milt) will a new 100 fix the problem?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Victor, if you wanted to buy a new 100 and it didn't work, you
 could return it for full refund !!
(victor milt) i'm on my way to the store

(Matt S.) Does the PCSG 96K module compare favorably to PG's 64k module as far
 as construction. Is hardware construction as good?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmm.... Does one ask Safeway if their products are as good
 as Giants??
(Mike A.) I'd say they're about the same...even some of the same chips.
(larry l) pcsg needs better picture in ad
(Mike A.) Agreed!
(Phil W.) PG Desgns is outstanding; probablly no big difference!
(joel) agree w/ Phil

(Matt S.) Does PCSG 6 Rom BANK work with POLAR Eng'S ROM2?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The 6 ROM bank reportedly works well with any ROM prepared for
 the Model 100. That is what it was made for, not just to use PCSG ROMs.
(Matt S.) I ask question because I have noticed that call to enable and disable
 on ROM2+Cleauseu are different from some of PCSG's roms.
(Mike A.) Polar Eng. could answer for sure but I think Tom B. and Co. up there
 straightened that out; now all work in harmony, I'm told.
(Matt S.) Define "straightened that out"?
(Mike A.) Early Polar ROMs had some trouble intermixing with ours & others,
 I don't know the technical particulars, however.

(Matt S.) Any news on SUPERROM?
(Mike A.) Less than 3 weeks, with fingers firmly crossed ! 

(Sysop Tony) 1) How come folks insist on calling it a 128K expansion when
 I read 96K.  Slip another increase in on us?  and...
 2) You said... "program from bank to bank". Does that mean program in one
 bank, data in another, and access across boundaries?
(Mike A.) RAM Basic is added that lets a program access data from any bank
 and, the 128K is adding original 32K plus the 3 other 32K banks 96K and 128K
 sort of banter back and forth
(Sysop Tony) Well, If programs can access data in other banks then the only
 limitation is 32K file size in each bank. But simulated contiguous memeory???
(Mike A.) I don't think anyone's figured that one out !
(Sysop Tony) Well then, back to basics.
 What do you mean "program from bank to bank"?
(Mike A.) Wish I had my manual, but it's basically Open A,B,C,D as ....
 for data only.
(Sysop Tony) Then you CAN access files(data) in other banks, and essentially
 you have 128K memory, limited only by 32K partitions (file size limitation)
(Mike A.) Yes, depending on the programmer, of course.
(Sysop Tony) That point hasn't been publicised!

(larry l) 1)is there any way to tell the age of my m100.  2) what is superrom
(Sysop Tony) I know of no way to tell the "age" of a computer....
(Mike A.) Super ROM is 4 programs in one: Lucid spreadhseet, Write ROM text
 processor, Data Base, and Thought Outliner on snap-in ROM. All are integrated
 with Cut, Copy and PASTE.

(ROBI) I have 2 100's one old and one new; on the old with AC power there is
 negligble change in the LCD when I use RS232 on the new one with AC power,
 I have to adjust the LCD when I go into telecom.
(Sysop Tony) That's not very definitive, Robi...
 Could be differences in internal components.
(larry l) robi..there is a stamped code on the bottom of the m100 which looks
 like a date code..
(Phil W.) there is a serial number! 
(ROBI) they both have serial numbers but no idea where the change was made

(John) I suppose superrom works w/128k?
(Mike A.) Absolutely !
(John) absolutely to me mike?
(Mike A.) yes, all  4 bnks

(joel) Mike:  Please be so kind as to compare your DB wit' T-Base
(M. Anders, PCSG) I can speak for ours at least. It works in combo w/Lucid,
 where you design your own input screens and reports, using the test editor
 built in to the M100.  Multiple views of the same data, so you can have many
 pages per input form.   Cut, Copy, Paste and Select between other programs.
(joel) how easy is it to rearrange the database? & how fast does it sort &
 print (T-Base weaknesses, these, last; the first a strength)
(M. Anders, PCSG) ah yes, our strength it's VERY fast, because it's machine
 language overlay techniquque; fast as the other built-ins.  
(joel) ok;  & a comment: had I known that your could call other banks from
 BASIC, I'd certainly have bought your RAM instead of PGD's.
 thanks for the feedback.

(victor milt) is the data base for the rom disk oriented or only memory
(M. Anders, PCSG) All database programs need to use RAM at this point.
 except Chipmunk, of course...
(victor milt) so how many files can you hold 
 that's what i mean...chipmunk. also when will you be shipping these units 
(M. Anders, PCSG) depends on size of input screen...I'd have to check on exact
 numbers. Shipping S-ROMs within 3 weeks, BTW
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Chipmunk has it's own database program on disk. Not ROM.
(victor milt) will you ever make a compatible IBM database to interface with
 the lucid?? 
(M. Anders, PCSG) Other than SYLK conversions and the like ?
(victor milt) yeah...direct....an IBM lucid!! wow 
(M. Anders, PCSG) Wow is right...but I'd better not say.
(Phil W.) Buying disk+ to get 1-2-3 i/f is a pain!

(Matt S.) I know this will sound like an advertisement, but there are only
 three companies I would buy products from and PCSG is one of them.
 If SUPERROM is even one half as good as LUCID and WriteROM they have a product
 which will be ten times better than other integrated roms !
 this is a personal opinion from a well healed user.

(Margie) to J.K. Heilman and all who helped with DSKMGR...
 Just what I wanted for Xmas.

(John) I read somewhere (dl?) that after mem. expansion...
   what's that all about?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Clarify John, you lost me. What is what all about??
(John) oops.. won't lie flat like agood laptop should
(Mike A.) Well, it bulges a bit, but the door closes.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Most folks have LEGS or pencils or sump'n anyway.

(:LAN Y:) Q for Mike re SUPERROM. The mix of features in superrom is
 outstanding but perhaps for some (ME!) a bit tilted towards data processing.
 I realize there are limits to how much can fit into a 32K bag, but has anyone
 considered a SUPERROM II which would be more a TEXTROM.  I had in mind
 a lineup like: WRITE/OUTLINER?   oops.. plus DISK+ and RAM+
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good grief Lan!! Pleez let'm get the first SUPER ROM out
  before 1988!!!
(Mike A.) Gee, that part of Super. Full Write functions and Thought Outliner..
(:LAN Y:) Sorry DAVE, but I was addressin R&D not shipping. I agree WRITE +
 Thought Outliner is neat but I would like RAM+ AND DISK + ALSO.  Call me
 idealistic but just askin'. great product, anyway I hope.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) ALSO = X-TEL 

(victor milt) i'm goin to be on a plane for too many hours; can someone recmmd
 a good game for the m100?? 
(Sysop Tony) [I knew it!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good grief!! We gawt a ton of 'm. See the .CAT files in DL 3
  which include ARCADE.CAT and ADVENT.CAT et cetera. Let us know your interests
  and it'd be easier.
(Curtis) try Blkjak
(joel) Let's Play Monopoly from Custom, but prolly not deliverd by Wed

(joel) First a comment for Mike: Didn't mean to put you on the spot, but to
 sell me the product you'll have to wean me from T-Base....
 and a question for Dave re: 600 BASIC:
 No INSTR etc?  What do they provide for those of us who glory in string
 manipulation?  I can't IMAGINE a BASIC wit'out 'em.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Joel you certainly aren't alone there!! I've talked to various
  software developers over the past week none of whom had received the BASIC as
  yet and all were HORRIFIED at no STRING$() or INSTR. However methinks the
  28 additional commands available from DBCALLS.LIB may have more than the
  answer once that gets into the hands of folks that can understand it better
  than I.  "CALL QFIELD" looks powerful, and may be the answer.
(hjb) [another MS triumph for incompatibility. ... ]
(joel) ok; just interested.  Just put a thou into this machine and no intention
 to replace

(Denny T) Mike, Has there been any more thought on a ultra cheap Chipmunk
 package for current owners that would contain a 2 drive adaptor and
 no bundled software?
(Mike A.) Denny, is 399 "ultra cheap"?
(Denny T) weelll not quite!!
(Mike A.) OK, well just askin'...
(Denny T) no

(John) Mike, tell me about Thought OUtliner, please?
(Mike A.) allows ThinkTank-like outlines that can be transferred into ThinkTank
 without any conversion utilities; port the applications as text files and then
 cut and paste them into the appropriate Super ROM file, track and organize
 thoughts into easy, workable outline form, organize projects, information,
 correspondence...lots of apps.....
 I'm just getting started with a long document on thing thing myself...
(John) Idon't know abt Thinktank either. I'm still pretty new at this
 m100.refs.?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) ThinkTank is for the IBM-PC desktops.
(Mike A.) er, I'll upload about a 5K description of Super this week, standby.

(Matt S.) ^Dave^, on M600 is there any provision for sending control code
 sequences to one's printer from WORD? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope. Plain CTRL-x type may be sent, but not ESC coding.
  Having that looked into but methinks a proper word processor will have to
  wait for either a Write EPROM or a good BASIC program. WORD is a very
  efficient text editor, but not the cat's meow as a print formatter.
(joel) hard to customize a ROM program for particular printers
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Write ROM permits that Joel.
(Matt S.) I thought that it was a mere oversight of the documentation.
 But occording to what you are saying WORD is very efficient memo processor!
 Write rom is not on M600
(Sysop .^Dave^.) guess you may be more or less true. Ya see, the ESC is an
  essential part of the System Manager's repetoire.
(Matt S.) Mike, any plans for WriteROM on M600. 
(Mike A.) Not that I know of, but subject to change.

(Sysop Tony) Denny has a point. If you buy Chipmunk #1 with the Bundled
 Software. Then buy #2, with the two-way adapter Why have to buy a second set
 of the Chipmunk software???
(Mike A.) You don't have to, that's what I meant; the 399 price is still not
 set in concerete, so time to lobby Larry Holmes and PCSG.
(Sysop Tony) But The adapter is an additional price tag to consider too, right?
(Mike A.) We'd like to make it all in one package, just for convenience.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, but folks who already have a chipmunk #1,,,
 don't need the whole package.  Just the adapter and a second 'munk.
(Mike A.) Yes, that's what I meant.
(Sysop Tony) So what is the current price structure For buying a second
 Chipmunk, and the necessary two-drive adapter?
(Mike A.) the Current price is 500, if I'm not mistaken.
(Sysop Tony) OK... that's what I was led to understand....
 It's another big committment, price-wise.
(Mike A.) Definitely !
(Denny T) Was that price to include a rechargeable Munk? 
(Mike A.) A.C. was my understanding...will have to check.
(Sysop Tony) Might be a good idea to have Larry post something. I was under the
 impression AC units would be $299 with a $125 nicad upgrade available.
(Denny T) t'would be a good deal with rechargeable
(Mike A.) 2 chipmunks in a box would be nice too !
(Sysop Tony) Well, $399 is a good deal for the rechargeable Chipmunk...
 with software. Two - in - a - box, would probably cost almost a grand!
 But we can dream.

(Sysop Tony) Mike, thanks for being here...
(joel) Mike:  Thanks for the info!
(Sysop Tony) You can see a lot of folks are interested in PCSG products...
 Thanks to all others who attended...
(Mike A.) Definitely, and thanks to you, too.  bye. 

(Sysop Tony) CO END.  Go to Yak-yak mode.
