(larry l) Mike...I recently installed my rom+; rom v 2.5 and it cured almost
 all of my cold starts..but I didnt find out about it until I called with a
 problem; why dont you guys send notices of upgrades that really are bug
 corrections?
(Mike A.) I don't know why they don't, Larry. I just do my best to talk about
the upgrades and hope the word gets out seems like mailings are the way to go.
(larry l) yes, i think mailings are what i mean. it was just that it seemed to
 be such a major bug. the techies knew as soon as i described the problem that
 they just sent out the rom free...(for which I am grateful)
(Mike A.) Great !  Bottom line is you had a problem and they fixed it pronto.
(larry l) no argument there
(Sysop .^Dave^.) You know it seems to me that there is zilch after sale notice
  of upgrades by any 100 software company except on this SIG. And then only by
  some happenstance. Akshullee, don't think it is that common that companies
  REALLY notify all customers. Some exceptions come to mind specifically Tandy
  Corporation, QuickSoft, and RoseSoft.
(larry l) right dave. when my hospital buys a half million $ CAT scanner we
 expect good technical support from the manuf. when I buy a $4000 computer
 I have come to expect nothing in the way of support.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And in many cases the notices of upgrades from companies
  [as opposed to BUG problems] are for the purpose of selling another version
  rather than a no-cost upgrade announcement.


(Rich L ) has anyone gotten the "June" issue of portable 100/200/600?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) giggle
  [tee hee]
  (twitter)
  <chortle>
(Rich L ) I figured as much.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sumbaudee reported, after phoning them, that they SAID they
  had new subsription service and as a result the July issue went out "on time"
  and that June would be a little late but August would be "on time".
  After over three years, I've become very sick of their "explanations" and no
  longer waste money telephoning them. The only thing to do is practice what
  Mortimer has taught me.
  "Impatience begets patients."
  Often, the magazine is worth waiting for.
(Mike A.) It's called O.O.Co., Dave- Out Of Control !


(wwkiii) i've just found out that i'm off to London in a week or so questions
 that arise are (1) is there a good way to get back to CIS from there,
 and (2) if using l-dist to private systems, what kind of problems should
 I expect (other than price!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) starting point is ABROAD.HLP in the DL 1 database. Need
  special modem, or adapter of some kind, to get hooked up in England.
(Eiji) Diane Duane was the member who had information PPN is [75036,3453],
 better leave a message and ask her again.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And Walt, you might want to EasyPlex her if time is short.
(wwkiii) Again, thanks for all the mighty-fine and super-quick help.


(Joe B.) I have URII and a M200 and when I clear out all memory and files in
  one bank I still have only about 10,000 bytes left as opposed to the normal
  19500! where'd all my memory go?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Down the Yellow Brick Road.
  Unfortunately, I have no 200 experience with the bank switching stuff and
  such. Also, wrong company rep is present to help you as to the ROM.
  Suggest, Joe, that you leave a message for Traveling Software at their
  User ID of 76466,15 and hope for a response. If'n you don't want to telephone
  them, that is.
(Rich L ) Joe might just have some memory hidden somewhere. might not be the
 URII
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Very true, but having no experience with the Tandy 200,
  I don't make recommendations about CLEAR, kiss it, kick it, or swear at it.


(Joe B.) Does the 600 allow one to write files of unlimited length?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope. Limited to 64K.


(Rich L ) ok... the 200 CLEAR statements are the samr for the 200 eccept the
 maxram address is diff. have you checked your MAXFILES=1 etc?
(Joe B.) no. what is that?  sorry, not much experience in basic, but will try
 if you'll tell me how.
(Rich L ) CLEAR0,MAXRAM and set the MAXFILES=1
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "MAXFILES" controls the number of files that you may have open
  at the same time; each takes up about 256 bytes so if you had somehow set
  MAXFILES=5 through use of another program, over 1,000 bytes would be held in
  reserve for useless use. See FILEN.DOC for some explanation; that is in DL 4.
  In BASIC, use the command ?MAXFILES at the Ok prompt to see how many files
  are reserved.
(Rich L ) also the PASTE BUFFER can hold memory, you can do a [F7] and then a
 [F6] while in TEXT to clear it.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) True Rich, but CLEAR in BASIC dumps the Paste.BF too.
(Joe B.) Ok, any way to clear the HIMEM?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Joe, if'n you CLEAR256,MAXRAM that will set HIMEM = MAXRAM
  in MOST cases. Note that we were talking about using command syntax in BASIC.
  For many purposes, it isn't necessary to write a program. Just tell your
  Tandy 200 what you want by direct command. One easy example is:
  TIME$="12:21:58" which is a BASIC statement without a program.


(Rich L ) I am using a program from SIGEA SYSTEMS called TELECOMMUTER for the
 IBM/TANDY. It work just like the 100 plus has many extra features. It's a good
 program; just thought you'd like a report on it maybe.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rich, it is indeed a super fine program. I've been Beta tester
  of it for some time. Methinks starting with version 3.1 or so; let me suggest
  that you provide a review for the Tandy Professional SIG or ask Wayne Day if
  he would like a review for the online electronic magazine that will be
  activated within the next few days Sigea's X-TEL.CO for the Model 100/102 and
  Tandy 200 is also a fine program and works with Telecommuter in Fast File
  transfer just fine. Wayne's User ID is 76703,376.
(Rich L ) <-- doesn't write or spell to good. I may leave that to someone else.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, contact Wayne to see where he might like a review.
  M100SIG h'ain't the right place for it.
(PaulS) What is meant by work just like the 100?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Joe Berkovitz and Harry Brawley of Sigea Systems couldn't see
  why the friendliness of the Model 100 couldn't be transferred to the desktop
  computers. Thus, Telecommuter's Function Key use is very similar to that of
  the Model 100 in Telcom, Text processing et cetera. Specifically,
  Telecommuter uses ADRS.DO in the precise same manner as the Model 100 for
  Telcom [with enhancements.]
(PaulS) My IBM at work is very MEAN and NASTY at times. Thanx.


(JOHN S) OK.. Has anybody been successful in using Disk-Power , and then
 loading in Powr-Disk and then return to DIsk-POwer? I have been unable to do
 so without Crashing my system.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not too surprising since they are likely to occupy the same
  RAM area. Don't have a TDD so I've not experimented with either, and Disk
  Power is very new on the scene. Question: ...
  Why try to use both?
(JOHN S) I like some of the features of each program, and there are a lot of
 programs on the Sig for Powr-disk.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh, one member did comment to me that he couldn't remove
  Disk Power except by Cold Starting. That match your experience John?
(JOHN S) yes exactly.. They have managed to make it invisiable to the normal
 erase function , and it doesn't directly occupy high memory. I think the
 problem may be in the Hook table.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmm, wonder if you could POKE the Hook table with 0 stuff so
  that Disk Power could go bye bye.
(JOHN S) yes I think it is possable, but I haven't had time yet to figure
 out what hooks it uses
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Will CHANGE.100 or FILEN.100 find where Disk Power is located?
(JOHN S) I don't know whether CHANGE.100 of FILEN.100 will work, but I am
 willing to try it out. By naming the extension for the operating system .SY
 though, they seem to have made it very hard to deal with any normal functions
 used in BASIC.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) CHANGE is said to be very useful program for a lot of very
  esoteric stuff including changing filenames and extensions so that the
  Model 100 can handle them normally.
  See CHANGE.DOC in DL 4 for the perspective. Good luck!
(JOHN S) thanks for the help, and I'll let you know what I come up with.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hope you are aware that Ultra Soft is active on the SIG.
  Might have the answer for you.


(Curtis G) Dave do you know if there is a longer and more flexible cable
 for the chipmunk to 100 connection?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Denny Thomas and Tony Anderson are the Chipmunk cable experts
  unless Eiji can help. You there Eiji??
(Eiji) I made it myself. Two 20 pin connector and a cable cost around $8.
(Curtis G) from Radio Shack?
(Eiji) No, I went to an electronics store with original Chipmunk cable and
 asked them if they have longer ribbon cable and the same connector.
(Curtis G) do you know if there is a length limition?
(Eiji) I don't know.  Mine is 5ft. and work fine. 


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay folks. That closes the COnference for today.
  Many thanks to ALL.
  stay and yak if you wish, of course.
  the conference room is always open.
