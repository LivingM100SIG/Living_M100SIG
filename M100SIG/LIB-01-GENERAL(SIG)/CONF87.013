(Larry L) what's with channnel 18?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is the new default channel and there is no Channel 30.
(Denny T) did we get the new software?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Denny, if'n you mean SIGware, yes. Been about four days now.


(Larry L) Dave..how do you program macros so fast?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, depending on the software I'm running, it is a fairly
  simple matter to program macros on the Tandy 1000. The Model 100 is a
  different matter and can't be done online -- I don't think.
(Larry L) Do you know of a m100 program that can program macros off-line or
 when ever?   
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes Larry, but there is nothing in the public domain;
  the Supera program from Micro Demon allows all of the alpha keys to be
  programmed up to 14 characters each.
  I've said it oft before, and I'll say it again; Supera is the finest single
  program for the Model 100. Period.
(Larry L) what else does it do?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See SUPERA.PRD and SUPERA.REV in DL 13, but neither does
  justice to the program ...
  search/replace ...
  upper/lower case conversion ...
  super calculator including HEX to Decimal or reverse ...
  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
(Denny T) Dave, I left a msg to David but, have you ever used ESC 6 in Supera?
 mine just does a 'top of file'
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Saw your message, but just don't bermember. Have it in
  schedule to reload Supera and test his last message with UR-II and CDOS
  but haven't got to it as yet.
(Denny T) ok, yes I was going to try that patch also.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep J.D, ---- channel 18 is now the default channel that we'll
  ALWAYS fall into ...
  Until they change it again!
(J.D.) [CIS works in mysterious ways.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Try the /tun 30 command!
 /tun 30
 ? CBXRCN - Restricted channel
(Larry L) [doesn't work]


(Sysop .^Dave^.) J.D. <- Has Ezra Pound finished the first guest Editorial?? 
(J.D.) Sorry Dave, not Ezra. Good guess though.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Bermember when I was featured in Pico magazine, some wit here
  said I looked like Ezra on Metracal!!


(J.D.) I had lunch with John P. Mello Jr. the other day. He sends his best to
 CIS M100SIG folk, but claims he has little reason to visit us here. He uses
 his 100 not at all, and some of the reporters who work...
(Phil W) [what IS he using?]
(J.D.) for him at the Boston Business Journal sometimes use 200s, but only for
 writing and editing, then upload to typesetting system. Mello's computer is a
 Tandy 1000 that he bought himself. (BBJ is apparently unwilling to purchase
 him a computer, or he hasn't asked. Anyway, he remembers his 100 days happily
 but doesn't see much reason to get back involved. You can Eplex him a message
 if you feel like it, as he has MCI Mail. Believe his address is JMELLO.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Thanks, but MCI ain't eggZAKlee the same as EasyPlexing a
  message! Anybody know what the surcharge is to MCI via EasyPlex??
(J.D.) Sent him one recently; cost me $.45. Seemed worth it.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh, can be valuable for business purposes of course,
  but a bit steep for "hye dere!"


(J.D.) Recently saw a demo of Diconix battery-powered ink jet, and was
 impressed. But in the DLs the reviews are generally lukewarm. Anybody here use
 one, know why it isn't as good as it seemed to me?
(Phil W) [price!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Personally, I could never tell the difference between
  Deacon X and Ezra Pound, so don't ask me!
(J.D.) [Dave woke up on "strange" side of bed.]
(Phil W) [he has no other side!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [fyll <- we have to excuse J.D. - gnu around here.]
(Denny T) Have only seen one, but was not impressed with the construction for
 the price. Phil's little printer is a much better buy at 99.
 what was the name Phil?
(Phil W) TTX is the 80 col one for $99-130
(Larry L) I bought the TTX and it has a couple of shortcomings, such as high
 noise and the fact that replacement parts are not available. It is almost
 better to buy two and keep one in the closet.
(Phil W) [TTX is very quiet!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "High noise" ??? I think it's pretty quiet!
(Phil W) [Thermal = quiet!]
(Larry L) By noise I mean the noise of the print head movement screw; much
 noisier than using belt or string drive such as in the Trendcom Industrial
 recorders.
(Phil W) TTX has a lot of limitations, but as a portable emergency p[rinter,
 it's fine.  I really dislike thermal paper.  But the Diconix needs ink
 cartridges, special paper, and costs more than a good NLQ-capable fast matrix
 printer - lots of money to spend for an ocassional printer.  But it is a
 matter of need.  If I traveled all the time, then I might want one.
(Larry L) I agree that the TTX is a GREAT value. In fact I am considering
 buying a second.
(J.D.) Thanks for input. This is one of the biggest problems with being an
 editor. You never have to PAY for anything, so when a product is good but too
 expensive, you almost never know. Phil, what's your relationship with TTX?
 Some folks from Foster City came and gave me a demo in San Francisco when they
 introduced the printer - was that you?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [tee hee!]
(Phil W) Nope. just a user.  That is where Rick Hanson gets his I think, if he
 still does.  Seems that Purple may be the only source, from what I hear.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Last I gnu, Travelling Software sold them too.
(J.D.) [Still like Diconix speed, quality, quiet, convenience. Oh well.]


(HAL S) IS THE TOPIC OF THE DAY PRINTERS OR MAY I DIGRESS
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Topic = what's on your mind.
(HAL S) RIGHT, DOES ANYONE KNOW OF ANY SOFTWARE THAT TREATS THE TANDY PORTABLE
 DISK DRIVE AS A DISK AND NOT JUST AS A FANCY CASSETTE
(Phil W) There are several third-party (commercial!) os's for the TDD.
 Such things as POWR-DISK, POWR-DOS, TS-DOS, TS-RANDOM, etc. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See DISKOS.INF in DL 13. also there is DSKMGR in DL 9 which is
  superior to FLOPPY.CO but is NOT a full system such as Powr-DOS et alia.
(Phil W) But the "fancy cassette" rap (seen in mags sometimes) is a bit much
 with a directory structure, files stored in non-sequential sectors
 (as needed), ability to erase a file, no need for cuing, etc.
 I've seen few cassettes that could approach the TDD for convenience.
(HAL S) GRANTED PHIL, BUT WITH ONLY FLOPPY.CO OR DSKMGR THE ABILITY TO STORE
 AND RETRIEVE FILES IS ALL IT GIVES YOU, IT IS QUICKER THAN A CASSETTE AND
 PRETTIER BUT WHAT I WANT OUT OF A DISK DRIVE IS ACCESSIBILITY THROUGH PROGRAMS
 I WRITE AS WELL AS THROUGH A MENU
(Phil W) [prettier??]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [as in <> ugly]
(Phil W) Well, the OS's in the file dave cited will give you that, but for
 most you can have only one disk file open at a time.


(jimT) Can TDD be used in TELCOM?
(Phil W) Basically, no.  There is only one comm chip in the M100 and it is used
 for the TDD when connected.  There are some workarounds by using external
 modems in one of the files on the SIG (DL9, DPUSER.00? I think -- or a 
 file with the name DSKTRM in one of the DL's).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The DSKTRM files in DL 3 are what Tony keeps sending folks to.


(jimT) Is Portable/100 DEAD?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ho hum ....
  Very short on positive FACTS of the matter but they are struggling still.
  January issue has been "promised."
  Patience else patients.
(J.D.) Not much of a comment, but I saw Park Morrison, P100's current editor,
 at CW Communications in Peterborough Wednesday. He said they're still trying
 to get it out. Wish 'em luck.


(Phil W) FYI: the Diconix 150 is identified in the jan 13 PC Magazine as
 a product of the year 1986. List is $479 (Oooph!).
 In the same issue the PC Convertible is id'd as a miss of the year, and the
 Tandy 600 is mentioned as a product which "makes the PC Convertible
 look good". 
(J.D.) [argh.]


(J.D.) In research for CW's Portable Computer Review, the NEC Multi-Speed has
 consistently received raves from retailers, consultants, and users.
 Anyone spend any time with one yet? I think NEC has finally released a system
 to challenge some of the other players in this market.
(Phil W) The m-speed looks preety good; the review I read was very positive,
 except they thot the screen was not among the best.  They thot the ROM-ware
 is OK, but not great - the overall review was very good to excellent.
 The problem I have with NEC is that their user support in the past was not
 good.  Will remain to see if that is fixed; needed to support such products!
(J.D.) Phil, retailers and distributors say NEC is finally working to improve
 support and distribution. M-S's main selling points are twisted-crystal LCD
 (better than Toshiba's but everything pales next to Zenith Z-181's),
 dual-speed processor, 640K RAM, 512K ROM sockets, two 720K microfloppies,
 built-in applications on ROM, 11-pound weight (smallish for high-end laptop)
 and price--$1,995. Internal 1,200-bps modem is optional.
(Phil W) Well all of that makes it a worthy competitor to the T1100+, but not
 necessarily better.  A bit faster, to be sure, but also 2+ lbs heavier.
 BTW -- did you read Stewart Alsop's description of the "Perfect Laptop"
 in PC Mag last week?  Like a M100 (no disks), four lbs, 256K RAM min,
 256K ROM, 80x24 screen (he does not like flip up), and selling for
 about $500.  He says that Tandy really missed the boat when they did not go
 to 80C86 with the M102 and capture the market.  I think that is right if you
 view the laptop as a true portable, vs. mini-desktop.
(J.D.) Phil, I need to send you a copy of almost identical article
 I wrote in 12/84 issue of Portable Computer! Forgot to mention key advantage
 of NEC Multi-Speed --- a standard (not optional, as with IBM PC Convertible)
 CRT output for use on a desktop. This makes the M-S useful as your main
 computer, even if you have fairly...
(Phil W) [Toshibs's have too]
(J.D.) with Toshiba. [Phil, Toshiba didn't tell me that. Have to check.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Did Alsop mention need for separate Modem and RS-232 ciruitry? (Phil W) No - not an issue, if disk drive runs off bus!!  Anyway I can buy a
 T1100+ a mile from here for $1750, with 640K, 2 drives, all ports,
 300/1200 baud internal modenm is extra but then may use WorldLink.....
 except I don't think I will buy one; M100 works fine for my needs and mine
 has 256K of RAM!
(J.D.) Datavue has some interesting designs coming out, but the tradition there
 is to announce a product a year or so before shipping.
 Don't hold yer breath, even though system is promised to compete with
 Toshiba & NEC but retail for $995.



(O.T.NEW) (O.T.)CIPMNK OR TANDY??????????
(Sysop .^Dave^.) O.T., it isn't necessary to type your identifier.
  It is put in automatically by the system.
  Now, I suppose you are asking which is better, the Chipmunk or the Tandy
  portable disk drive and I'll let Phil answer as he has both.
(Phil W) suggest you read the file TDDCHP.ART in DL13.
 It is a quick comparison.
(O.T.NEW) THANYES'HOW BOUT A TIP. DONT KNOW RROPES YET
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay O.T., if you haven't done so be SURE to read
  the $$$$ saving tips in the Bulletin files. Choose Bulletins from the menu
  here on the forum and get hard copies. A LOT of good help available.
(O.T.NEW) ASIDE FROM $,WHICH DRIVE BETTER?
(Phil W) Chipmunk. [but I NEVER use mine anymore!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) They are SO much different and have such different
  capabilities that t'is not fair to go quite so simply. A lot more to it.
(Phil W) [figure THAT out!]
(O.T.NEW) WHAT DO YOU USE??????????????
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The Chipmunk.
(Phil W) TDD
(O.T.NEW) WHAT DO YHOW CAN ONE MAX THE 100 INTO A SUPER SYSTEMQ


(Jeff S) Thanks... has there been any new news in the last three weeks
 about this new disk drive?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope. Still 200K, $199.99 and not known on availability.
(Phil W) My integrated GUESS is that it will be much like lod TDD in size and
 performance with more capacity.  Big issue will be can it read old TDD disks!
(Jeff S) but what about the way it is interfaced?  RS232?
(Phil W) Yes (guess).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Guess = Yes. Not KNOWN.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Phil, you want to tell O.T. about your perfect system
  with ROMs and disks and et cetera including total cost?
(Phil W) Ouch. not COST!!
 My model 100 now has 256K of RAM (32K + 224K PG Designs RAM in 7 banks)
 it, plus Ultimate ROM II (soon to be Sardine), fills the bottom hole in
 the M100 (no such RAM expansion hole in 102).  This leaves no room for the
 Chipmunk header (aka interface) board, so I use the TDD exclusively;
 trade off RAM vs. Chipmunk very much suits my uses, after trying it
 both ways.  All of this is  always a personal choice, tho.  My M100 is
 a heavily used second (portable) computer, with most work done on PC-type
 (the one I'm on now due to split screen capability).
 For an only computer, I think the Chipmunk is the way to go.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hope that helps you O.T., but note that the $$$ in Phil's
  "perfect lashup" ....
(Phil W) [PG RAm = $575 for 224K!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) must be in the range of $2,000 plus.
(J.D.) [money to burn, Phil?]
(Phil W) [not that bad, Dave!]
 MOre like $400 for a M100 (say), $600 for RAM bank, $200 for TDD,
 $150 for ROM. Very expensive (buy a T1100+?) but not 2K.


(Mel S.) Ohayo gozaimus from Japan!


(Jeff S) I guess this is not the best place to say it, but after January 1,
 the phone company here in Ont/Que has reduced their long distance charges
 enough such that it is now cheaper than DataPac at nights.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, understandable - heard about that. Neil Wick comes in
  direct also. But don't overlook the DTAPAC.HLP file in DL 3 which solves some
  of the problems of Datapac use.
(Phil W) [CIS node in Toronto]
(Jeff S) Those DATAPAC.HLP suggestions do work.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Glad to hear it. Connie Kageyama does good work and was able
to get some help here also! Camz, I think, gave him a tip.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, the time has come ...
