(larry l) is there any way to generate a "break" command on the m100?
(Sysop Tony) No. folks have been trying various means for years, and there has
 never been a way of doing it. It is included, however in the Tandy 200.
(larry l) @#$%%^^&... thanks.
(Sysop Tony) (tee hee)


(Curtis G) Have yoy had a chance to play with the M-102 yet?
(Sysop Tony) No, not I.
(larry l) [saw one in the store]
(Curtis G) What uses can you see for the system buss?
(Sysop Tony) The system buss, is where you plug in an external disk drive,
external RAM expansion modules, a video interface, etc.


(larry l) spoke to the pubs of port 100 and they told me that they are changing
 mailing houses and that the mag should be delivered on a more regular basis.
(Sysop Tony) Don't we all hope.
(Curtis G) Yes.
(Sysop Tony) I don't seem to recall getting the June issue.
 Thanks for the info.
(larry l) they said that the june issue is at the old place and that it will be
 shipped soon but the july issue will get to us first.
(Sysop Tony) Incredible!!!
(Papa Denny) [increadible ditto]
(Sysop Tony) Yes, now I recall seeing something about the June issue being
 delayed.  It's about time they got another distributor!


(Tom W.) Tony do you remember my Q's about disk io.
(Sysop Tony) Maker 1 and Checker 1???
(Tom W.) yes. Well evidently they were hardware problems and suddenly started
 working after I added more records!.
(Sysop Tony) Very interesting.... (read unusual!) I tried the programs on my
 TDD and Chipmunk and they worked OK.  My DVI isn't working right now so failed
 to answer that question for you.
(Tom W.) Its ok listen does anyone make a longer cable for the interface
 connection?
(Sysop Tony) No, but I managed to kludge one up from a female to female
 connector and circuit board plug.  Wouldn't advise it, but there seems to be
 no male connector available that isn't a circuit board type of device.
(larry l) what sort of connector are you looking for?
(Sysop Tony) The DVI uses a 40 pin plug similar to the printer plug and a 40
 wire cable and it's about 6 inches long.  Which is too short!!! There appears
 to be no male connector that fits on the end of a cable of that type!
(larry l) have you tried the computer supplies catalog?
(Sysop Tony) Yes.  About a dozen of them... There is no male connector of that
 type listed.
(Papa Denny) Your right, Tony. There are a lot of headers avail but not likely
 to be heavy duty enough to be used for the DVI.
 AUGAT may have a connector though 
(Sysop Tony) The main problem is using the cable supplied, the computer sits
 right in front of the disk drive box, and if you put the legs on it, you can't
 insert a disk in the drive!  Very poor human engineering.
 Denny, I found a two row set of pins at Dow Radio that allowed me to connect
 two female socets together.  Best I could find.
(Papa Denny) Tony, don't you need the male sides?
(Sysop Tony) The double row of pins, inserts between two female sockets, and
 acted as a "bridge" between them.
(Papa Denny) Oh, I see, you had a f/m cable


(Sysop Tony) Gee!  Down to just us 3!
(PhilW) You are right....what do we do now?
(Sysop Tony) Well, we could plan a revolution!
(PhilW) How bout starting with the CAT files?
(Sysop Tony) Seriously... CO attendence has been down for about a month now.
(BruceD) Summertime.
(PhilW) [summer?]
(Sysop Tony) Phil, I got the impression....
 That the CAT files were going to be your current crusade?  (grin)

(BruceD) What is the cheapest anyone here has seen a 200 selling fore?
(Sysop Tony) $549... mail order.
(BruceD) Where is that from, Tony?
(Sysop Tony) One of the companies listed in the file DISCNT.INF in DL6.


(PhilW) What is the prospectus on the larger memory for 200?
(Sysop Tony) Well, PG Designs still ain't talking and Holmes turned over the
 software development to PCSG, and PCSG put the project on the back burner!
(PhilW) OK, well turning over the work to pcsg is not likely to speed it up!
 I wish the expeanded memory would get off the ground (like >32k per bank).
 the project would maybe spin off some larger contiguous memory for the M100
(Sysop Tony) As I understood it, the Holmes version would give the 200 a 32K
 bank while the PG Design version would be a 128K bank, but if they don't get
 cracking, they may miss the marketing "window"!
(PhilW) Yes they will.  The Holmes approach will not help the 100; but PG
 would.


(Papa Denny) I tried out the new Basic capability for X-Tel last night; was
 able to download a program via xmodem, load it into basic, run it, then jump
 back online *very quickly*. very nice and it works
(Sysop Tony) Yes, it's a wonderful concept, BUT as I messaged to Phil, you guys
 gotta be real careful with it... the clock keeps ticking while you're offline
 playing around in BASIC or TEXT. Seems it would be useful for Sysop types, but
 less so for regular users.
(Papa Denny) Yes I know, the pressure's on, but that was just for an experiment
 normally I'd just use it for an extension program while online.
(PhilW) For what it's worth, the various DIRACC files in DL1 provide the same
 TEXT and BASIC access while on line, and in about 500 bytes.  The TEXT part
 will save money in that you can edit a file on-line (say a pre-composed
 message) useful if you find an error while uploading or want to modify a reply
 in response to a new message.   Generally I agree with Tony on this, 'tho! 
(Papa Denny) Me too
(Sysop Tony) Ah, there are so many ways to go. Just adding a 1200 baud modem to
 the 200 gives you all that capability without the extra software and an
 increase in speed too!  I think that 1200 baud is the best investment for 200
 users; too bad the Model 100 won't support it without all the "fixes" and
 "make-do's" you have to use.


(Papa Denny) On the call you gave me for printing to the screen, I found an
 additional one that'll print a string until it hits a null. 0H, but a normal
 string doesn't contain a null at the end, does it?
(Sysop Tony) Well, yes and no. Not as you enter it, but then it's whisked away
 to a buffer, where it is terminated with a binary zero which is the equivalent
 of a null.
(Papa Denny) ahh. then the call is 23128,Varptr(string)
(Sysop Tony) Got me there; it may work that way but I'm looking at the
 operating system map, and it isn't that specific on how to get to it yourself.
(Papa Denny) I got this from an assembler manual; you just load the address of
 the string into the HL register then do the call.
(Sysop Tony) What about the B register?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Daddeeeee! Daddeeeeeeeeeeee!
(Papa Denny) So it WAS you! Dave
  What about the B reg?
(Sysop Tony) B register is supposed to contain the number of characters in the
 string +1.
(Papa Denny) Ahh, this call doesn't require that you know the length ahead of
 time.
(Sysop Tony) Ah. OK. Are you going to document it in a file for the benefit of
 others??? (hint!)
(Papa Denny) Arrrggg!
(Sysop Tony) sort of a PGMTIP.xxx in the series in DL4?
(Papa Denny) Ok, if you insist...
(Sysop Tony) (Gee getting files from you guys is like pulling teeth!)
(Papa Denny) but only after Peter uploads his files first!
(Sysop Tony) Oh NO! That's a tough stipulation!!!


(Jean Hamburg) does anyone use their 100 with apples?
(Sysop Tony) (I usually eat Oranges!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't think anyone here now does; did you get my message about
 that?
(Jean Hamburg) yes,dave thanks a lot I'm in NY now will try when I get home


(Sysop Tony) Anyway, I've been thinking of a new password generator program.
 Using the Chipmunk Spelling Checker files as word pool. It looks like we could
 have a 20K * 20K * 10 set of unique passwords. Shall I proceed???  (grin).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) EVERYBODY seems to have the perfect password program for
 others to break!
(Sysop Tony) Ah yes, but MINE is the password GENERATOR!  Makes up the
 passwords!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ah so, what does it do? Scramble the nth word in the zth file
 of the vth disk?
(Sysop Tony) That's what i figured!  Anyways,... I may call one SADPP.BA.
 Still Another Dxxx Password Program!  (grin)
(Papa Denny) One from column A one from column B
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Denny ??? What were you saying?? Two colums??
(Papa Denny) you know like a Chinese menu password program 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ohhhhh ...
(Sysop Tony) (That's the way PASSWD.GEN in DL1 works)


(DAVID E) this may have been adressed already; in the new format for the sig
 are all software programs now listed onder one subject.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) All of our programs and files will remain eggZAKlee where they
  are right now. Not sure I understand question. Did I answer it?
(DAVID E) yes, you did; there was talk of combining files it to a single data
 base in a past sunday talks.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And you may remember that my response was: Not on THIS Sig!!
(Sysop Tony) It would be virtually impossible to keep everything in one HUGE
 database. Access time would be snails pace.
(DAVID E) agreed
(Sysop .^Dave^.) David, what you may have heard about and been a bit misled
  is the practice on some SIG/Forums of putting ALL new programs in one DL
  section for their first month. That, I believe, is unnecessary with our X9
  file listing and such.


(Sysop Tony) Since you made a comment to the program author of the new MOIRE.BA
 program in DL3 about how he used an error trap to set up the program for the
 100 or 200 I took a look at it. It works nicely, and it's a clever technique;
 we used it once for determining what file was loaded so a program could open
 it the correct file, however, the technique in PGMTIP.010 would have been a
 bit more efficient in that it test to see what machine it's loaded in, and
 doesn't leave an error trap active through the rest of the program.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh, I'll take a look at that file. Seems that I have some
  weakness of being incapable of remembering all the goodies in our 2026 files
  down there!! I'll have to try harder!! Since James Yi is working on programs
  for both the 100 and 200 p'raps you'd like to point him to that file.
  T'would be good for his CLOCK.BA program too. Keeerek?
(Sysop Tony) Me too!  I can't remember them all. I'm sure he hasn't seen the
 PGMTIP file so I'll mention it to him. it would also work with CLOCK or any
 other program that's meant to run in either machine.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jim, I'll send you the Maryland Picnic flyer if you are
  interested. Where are you?
(JIM) when is picnic...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not yet determined. Trying to find out who is interested
  first.
(JIM) I will be gove until sept 18
(DAVID E) i am intereded dave
(Sysop Tony) (Ah! Stealing our picnic idea, huh?)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay David, I'll zip you one too; methinks picnic in August.


(Papa Denny) I have to go, but before I do I'd like to thank everyone for their
 nice comments on my recent happy event.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oh yes; we noted that you got another Model 100.
  Congratulations!
(Papa Denny) <grin>


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Did you note the underwhelming response to my report on the
  Model 102 ? Guess I'd best refile that in DL 6 ere long.
(Sysop Tony) Which report was that, Dave???
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Glad you asked me that Tony ...
  T'is the message in Section 6 from 76703,446 with 102 in the subject line.
  Upshot of it was that Model 102 is 100% software compatible with the
  Model 100
  [I think]
  as long as additional hardware isn't involved.
(Sysop Tony) Oh, THAT report! That seems to be the message we are getting from
 several sources now. Although there is SOME change in the ROM, since the
 checksums don't match. I'd guess that 99.9999999999% of the existing software
 will work.
(DANA) Will it handle dates into 2000 and beyond, which the 100 won't?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) didn't test DATE$ beyond software compatiblity and don't have
  a 102 myself. Not too worried today about next century.
  Right now is fine with me.
(DANA) Same here, but that spontaneous year advance annoys me
(Sysop .^Dave^.) One thing that interested me was that during the three hours
  of intensive testing with a LOT of fast file transfers at 9600 baud there
  wasn't a single instance of year advancement.
  HOWEVER! I'm not about to say the bug has been fixed!!


(TEX ALDREDGE) how do you use a coco for mass stroage fo the 100
(Sysop .^Dave^.) see the COCOTO.100 and COCO.TXT files in
  the DL 1 database.


(Hugh Lochrane) Looking for dial prog that will automatically dial a number at
 predetermined times and record how many rings before answer.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Umph, don't know about the ring recording but it sounds like a
  "War Games" type program you are looking for is that correct?
(Hugh Lochrane) No. Want to do quality assurance on a contract switchboard.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm; see what you mean --- use the command:
  BRO/KEY *DIAL*
  in the DL 1 database is best that I can do for you
  and YES I meant for the * to be there!!
(Sysop Tony) there is no way for the Model 100 to detect, count, or
 differentiate between ring signals, busy signals, or other audio on the line;
 the best you could do is to detect a modem carrier.
(Hugh Lochrane) How about determining time to answer?
(Sysop Tony) No... not unless the answer is a modem.
(Hugh Lochrane) Ok. will ty another approach.
(DANA) What about auto-answer hardware? I saw an article a few months ago in
 P100.
(Sysop Tony) Auto Answer responds to the signal on the telephone line when
 someone calls YOU.  Not to what is happening on the line when you call someone
 else.
(DANA) I understand that but just was thinking about it when the other topic
 was raised.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay folks ...
 methinks we can call this chat to an end ....
 "Chat! To an end!"
