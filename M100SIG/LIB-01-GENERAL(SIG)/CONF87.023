(Larry L) I notice that someone is offering a macro program; any knowledge of
 it? what size is it..etc... 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Depends upon the file you're referring to ...
(Larry L) [Macros.doc]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "Supera" from Micro Demon is the finest single program ever
  written for the Model 100 and allows macros for all of the alpha keys.
  See SUPERA.PRD and SUPERA.REV because it does a LOT more than just macros!
  MACROS.DOC is not by "someone"; it is from Tony Anderson a sysop here.
(Larry L) It is a long file so I didn't get a chance to read it yet.  I checked
 out the review for Supera and it does too much for me; I just want macros.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, but you might be surprised at how you can use the rest
  of Supera, such as overstrike mode in text and case change with
  search/replace and all that.


(PETER JABLOW) I have the interactive solution rom.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [poor fellow]
(PETER JABLOW) is it worth to buy the rom 2 for $219.00?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Definitely worth it to buy Ultimate ROM II or Super ROM
  if you need what they have to offer. Since you got the ISR, I suspect that
  you need one of the GOOD ones!
(PETER JABLOW) how much better is rom 2 than interactive solutions?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Peter, I'll be absolutely frank with you - I've never used
  ISR, but on the Forum here the folks report all sorts of problems. It is one
  of the products from a Tandy supported company that is minimal at best;
  UR2 has the finest print formatting program on the market whilst Super ROM
  provides the finest spreadsheet available in addition to a fine printing
  program. There is a file on ISR in DL 13 that might help you wiht it.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay folks, we have open topics today and seem to have started
  on subject of ROMs.  Mike A. <- you had a question on UR2??
(Mike A.) Question answered
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay --- I was very brief there Mike, but in a nutshell the
  word on the Forum is that if folks need to do a LOT of writing then get
  Ultimate ROM II, if they need spreadsheeting then get Super ROM. The database
  and outline programs are secondary to most folks considerations.


(Dave A.) general question: is the Kyotronic 85 the same machine as the M100?
 my initial impression is that it is.
 in what way(s) is the K85 different from the M100
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Different ROM, so machine language programs won't work.
  Has no modem. A lot of the best Basic programs won't work because of the
  differences in ROM.
  Programs that PEEK and POKE and/or CALL are likely to bomb.
(Dave A.) can I get a replacement ROM?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not talking about the plug in ROM, we're talking about the
  machine. Welded, soldered in place and t'would be a major undertaking to do
  anything about it. Folks that have the Kyo 85 say it is good for text work
  only, and only if you don't need fancy print out. Or words to that effect.
(Dave A.) oh, ok... well, fancy output can be formatted on my T1000, but will
 it load M100 files from tape?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is about the only thing it can do, I think.
  But don't load machine code files!! That would include ScripSit and such.
(Dave A.) oh, well, good nuff for me.. I'm not too worried about compatibility
 since I will be downloading text to my T1000 and Atari 80XL and have little
 need for anything other than portable notebook.


(Harold B.) When Tandy originally released the M100, did they also release
 specifications for the expansion ROM?
(Leonard E) [ha!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmm, methinks that is information that may be in the
  technical manual and/or may be available through Tandy's "Third Party
  Support" office but I suspect that PCSG, Traveling Software and other ROM
  folks --- Polar Engineering especially, found the information on their own
  without Tandy support.
(Leonard E) All they've got in the tech manual is the socket pin-out.
 This was still back when Tandy was 'paranoid'.
(Harold B.) One would think that if there was a standard way of accessing the
 ROM, each vendor would use the same entry point.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) They do, but with slight modifications; Write ROM, for
  instance, is accessed with  CALL 63012  and nothing else.
  Ultimate ROM II, from another company, uses 63013,1 which is clearly in the
  same ball park. Haven't tried to look at the System Map in DL 8 to see what
  it says about that.


(Leonard E) Any word on Sardine(tm) yet?
 Particularly with regard to wether on not you need an OS?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmm, think they're shipping but can't guarantee that.
  Just a second and let me look at humongous AD.
(Leonard E) I mean the *disk only* version! not the ROM version.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Reading the advertisement doesn't help, but t'would seem to me
  that an OS would be essential for the disk version. Key question then is does
  it have to be one of Traveling's OS ??  Dunno!
(Leonard E) Well, all it has to do is read info, so It'd only take a *small*
 amount of code to read it directly. And that would eliminate all sorts of
 hassles.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) It isn't just a simple "Read" involved though since it has to
  lookup and compare. Right?
(Leonard E) All it has to do is input data, everthing else is a program
 function anyway. The hard part might be determining where the words are on
 the disk, but they may just check *all* of them; but this is just "useless"
 speculation until we can get hard info.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, we shall see with Patience else patients.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Stephan, the file FLTIBM.DES in DL 3 would be a good starting
  place for you.
(Stephan Klein) i have FLTIBM.COM. it runs to send files to the m100 but not
 the other way
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Suggest you double check FLTIBM.DOC because i'm certain
  it is supposed to work both ways. Only ASCII files though.
  Phil Wheeler 71266,125 - the author - is on regularly if you want to message
  him. 
(Stephan Klein) it seems as if the m100 thinks it is sending the files
 the cursor comes back into the file after afew seconds but nothing happens.
 also, i have tried it with about four different copies and different versions
 of the program and its always the same result
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Personally, I can't help you more. But Phil can.
(Leonard E) just how *exactly* are you doing the xfer?
(Stephan Klein) Leonard, i am following the instructions.
(Leonard E) I've never seen the directions. I just use MODE COM1 {appropriate
 settings} and then COPY file COM1. What I was interested in was what you were
 doing on each end and when (keys pressed etc).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Stephan, Phil supports his programs. Suggest you query him.
(Stephan Klein) I haven'tried the mode and copy commands in DOS. i'll try them (Sysop .^Dave^.) If you intend to go that way instead of the FLTIBM way, then
  see TRANSF.IBM in the DL 3 area also. General transfer method is discussed
  there. Probably what Leonard was talking about.


(Gerald G) Okay, I do well with acuostic couplers on the m100 but I have not
 been able to get the latest version in my area.  The direct cable is available
 and there are two jacks I think to the system.  What is the other one for?
 I cannot seem to get started with a direct cable and I am now using an Atari
 for communications.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The new couplers are still "PromiseWare" methinks. Know that
  availablity is well behind Tandy's expectations. Patience.
(Gerald G) I could use help with the cable. Do you know what I mean by two
 jacks?
(Leonard E) Gerald, the 2 jacks are labeled Phone and Cassette, right?
(Gerald G) I boutht a kit with a startup kit for cis and dow...I am not sure 
 which is which. one is attached to the wire and one is loose.
(Leonard E) AHA! you mean two *plugs*!
(Gerald G) yes the plugs. 
(Leonard E) The beige plug goes in the wall jack, the other can go to a phone.
 Switched around they will *not* work. Also be sure that the switch on the left
 side of the 100 is set to DIR.
(Gerald G) Do both plugs have to be attached to have the m100 work direct.
(Leonard E) no. just the beige one to the wall.


(Neil W) I was wondering about the TDD for Deaf mentioned in previous CO;
 the file DeAF.100 in DL should work but specs for an external modem are given.
 Are these unusual or will any modem work?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No further developments that I'm aware of.
(Leonard E) The modems for TDD are *very* unusual. Also very expensive. pity.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Seems that the problem is that baudot has to be converted to
  ??? or sumsuch thing.
(Neil W) How much is very expensive?
(Leonard E) How does $300+ for a combination TDD and 'normal 300 baud' (BELL
 103) modem grab you? I don't recall exact price, it may have been $400!
 The baudot conversion isn't all that hard, but those non-standard tones are
 a pain. No single chip modems available due to low demand.
 (which is due to high price of TDD modems - Catch-22!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Neil, a trip to Handicapped Forum for exchange with Sysop
  Georgia Griffith might prove worthwhile if you wish to pursue.
  She's blind and deaf.
(Neil W) Sounds like it's more dificult than first appears.
 Will have to investigate further. 


(Neil W) Have been working still on Huron.100, but it's getting beyond the
 capacity of an 8K computer even with a new data compression technique.
 I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to upload 2 versions so as not to
 lock out those with low RAM quntities.
 Any estimate as to how many have only 8K?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good grief! NOBODY, but NOBODY, has an 8K machine!
  [well, hardly anyone] Neil, though I could be WAY off in left field it would
  be my estimate that only folks that NEVER use Telcom are still in the 8K
  stage. You know, they think it is a nice l'il gadget and fiddle with it at
  times. Or the brand new folks that don't get the right answers from their
  RSCC folks. Note that Tandy 102 doesn't come in 8K - starts at 24K.



(Neil W) how available is the PDD2 in RS in the U.S. It's not even on the
 upcoming price sheets in CAnada and the sale on the original PDD ended Dec. 24
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not very - only person that has showed up with one here got it
  only because he believed me and ordered it from protesting RSCC manager that
  knew nothing about it but placed order anyway.
(Leonard E) [have to remember that!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) So Mel has his, but the only delivery was that special order.
  We wait, and then practice "Patience else patients" some more.
  I'm supposed to get one within a week.  ????  we see.
(Neil W) I'm wondering if it will ever be intro'd in Canada or if they have
 other plans.
(Jeff S) [Tandy 600 comes to mind]
(Neil W) hopefully for improvements.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hope you all saw DRIVE2.REV in the DL 13 area.


(Neil W) THere are now EOS packages stocked at every RSCC.
(Leonard E) Neil, what is an "EOS Package"?
(Neil W) Express Order Software they now have about 30 non-Radio Shack,
 non-Tandy MS-DOS programs in stock at computer centres.  I even saw one store
 with UR-2 in stock.  Do they do this in the States?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) A very LARGE amount of EOS  isn't stocked at RSCC; only by
  special order. Yes, t'is done in the states.
  That catalog is one of the three that I mentioned earlier.


(Jeff S) I've heard of InterTAN, but what is it? 
(Neil W) Separate company (not subsidiary of Tandy), based in Barrie Ont. looks
 after all Radio Shack operations outside of US.  There are two sections of
 InterTAN, InterTAN Canada and another one for the rest of the world.
(Jeff S) Is that why we don't get computer catalogues any more?
(Neil W) I think so; there's some reorganization going on, besides as it is the
 catalogues are usually out of date by the time they're printed. Strangely
 enough, I have seen a software (only?) catalogue at Computer Centre but they
 only had one .(with Cdn prices too.)!
 The monthly flyer looks a little different this month (new art director?)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Catalogs are now three separate volumes.
(Neil W) We haven't had a Computer catalogue in Canada for about 8 months at
 least.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Still current is RSC-17, but I don't bermember when it came
  out.
(Neil W) They've switched to expensive-looking brochures for each model.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) those brochures have been common in the U.S. for at least two
  years.
(Jeff S) [Same in Canada]


(Jeff S) Is there a file here that discusses nested If statements in BASIC?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't bermember one specifically, but maybe in the PGMTIP
  files in the DL 8 area you might find one. Use BRO PGMTIP command as there
  are at least a dozen.
(Neil W) What about nested IFs?
(Jeff S) In some source code i've seen, There are multiple if statements within
 one line, and I've been having trouble interpreting them.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Simple rule: it is okay to IF within an IF
  but not okay to IF within an IF - if it doesn't work.
(Neil W) Can be very confusing. It could be helpful to re-write the line
 with indentations for each if.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jeff, the Model 100 Basic allows the NEXT without a variable
  which makes it MUCH more difficult to interpret the code.
  When a line ends with NEXT X:NEXT J:NEXT I
  it is a lot clearer than an ending of NEXT:NEXT:NEXT
(Jeff S) Sure, It's just where do you match the ELSE's, and which IF's do they
 correspond to, and some IF's will not have a corresponding ELSE!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) In line with Neil's suggestion, have you used PRETTY.100 ???
(Jeff S) I've used FANCY, but I'd love to see what PRETTY does.
 thanks for the suggestion 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [lack of an ELSE is due to jump out of loop.]
(Neil W) Maybe I should try making a help file if it doesn't already exist?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) PRETTY does a super job of LLISTing a program and perhaps
  VARLST.WM would help too; both in DL 8.
  Neil, I get the impression that Jeff is more concerned about decoding than
  coding.
(Jeff S) [That's right]
(Neil W) Yes ,that's what I was addressing.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Any and all help files are welcomed.  Tony is the overseer of
  the PGMTIP files. double check those, about 15 I think, and then ask Tony
  before you reinvent the wheel. Okay Neil??
(Neil W) Will do.


(Jeff S) Is there any file here that lists the most common repairs to
 Model 100's that users had to make.?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope. Nothing of that order at all.
  Screen replacement has been most common because of backing cars
  over it and such.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Closing time of conference, but stay for general chat if you
  wish ...
  bye bye all, and thanks muchlee.
