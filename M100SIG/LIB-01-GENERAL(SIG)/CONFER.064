(JAY) PORTABLE 100 MAG WSSUPPOSED TO BE WORKING ON A PUBLIC DOMAIN DISK
 OPERATING SYSTEM FOR THE 100.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ohhhhh, don't hold your breath; but I was talking about the
  Chipmunk disk system and P1/2/6 is working on a DOS for the Tandy disk drive
  [supposedly]
(Mike A.) [snicker!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) We have DSKMGR here in DL 5 for the TDD and there are three
  commercial OS for the TDD that I'm aware of. Have I lost count Tony??
(Sysop Tony) No, that's about it. 


(Doug M) Fairly simple question. At least I hope it's simple.
 Regarding the Database section of Superrom; We see so much about LUCID on the
 SIG and I'm wondering How the Database section is? Does it operate somewhat
 along the lines of TS's Tbase, which I have on cassette and rather enjoy,
 though I find it's report section rather a bit on the SLOW side.
 Any comments welcome, as I hope to get together the wherewithall to order
 SUPER later this summer.
(Mike A.) Super's Database is chiefly designed to totally interface with
 Lucid. It's a relational database (Like Tbase) but doesn't involve any complex
 codes; you create input screens just like typing in TEXT with unlimited size
 then,m print out reports or forms, getting information from as many files
 as you wish, with complete math between fields. Of course, during june
 (actually thru July 31) you also get the Business Analyst ROM with is like
 Tenkey+ (or the HP 12C advanced financial calculator...)
(Doug M) If I order through Express Software rather than directly will it be
 easier for getting across the border, etc...
(Mike A.) I'd imagine so, but don't know for sure..you have FedEx up there ?
(Doug M) yep...
(Mike A.) Oh, then maybe a direct call to Dallas would be faster then!
 ask for Alice and tell her Mike sent ya!


(RUSH CALEY) WHY CANNOT THE SUPER ROM PROGRAMS READ AND WRITE TO THE CHIPMUNK?
 E.G. WRITE ROM?
(Mike A.) Well, it'd take all morning to explain the softeare/hardware
 interface problem, but it IS possible to save all Super files to Chipmunk by
 simply toggling between the Super function and the Chipmunk menu (compatible).
 it was just one of those necessary compromises, keeping in mind the fact that
 we also had to work with cassette, TDD, DVI and so on...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rush, I see that you are on your CoCo at the moment.
  How do you like your new D/VI for the 100??
(RUSH CALEY) dave..I'm not on my coco. I don't have a modem for it. I'm on my
 M-100. The DVI is nifty, I got it for $150. I'm on the sig now to download
 from the DVI.CAT
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tee hee, the UPPER CASE fooled me!! Good luck; Tony here just
  gawt his D/VI too ...
  Have fun D/VIing the 100 way ...


(larry l) does anyone else but Tandy make a d/vi?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope none that I know of anyway.
(Mike A.) [Axonix was rumore]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony? Found anything strange in Computer Shopper lately??
(Sysop Tony) No, there is no clone of the D/VI. Axonix is still advertising the
 video interface but no one continues to advise us that they have one.
(Doug M) I have a december 85 issue of PICO  that has an ad for a 3.5" drive
 with video interface from a company called time-soft-EDV (thier capitals not
 mine).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Doug, look VERY carefully at that ad and you'll see that it
  isn't for the plain Model 100. Don't remember details, but we got caught with
  that once before.
(RUSH CALEY) that company with the disk drive and video interface went out of
 business anyway.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just found the ad; McDonald Micro Products and the video
  interface part of the ad was for the HX-20 and PX-8 only --- not for the
  Model 100 family.
(Doug M) yep...saw that as soon as you said look closely. As Rush points out
 it's academic since they're gone now.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, listed in detail in PICO of recent receipt ...
  Oh well ...


(Tom W.) Is any one familiar with the program pak called portable computing
 with the M100? In specific the prog called TERM?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) YUK!
(David K.) In answer to Tom's question, I have that software and book you are
 speaking of, but I would have to dig it up in order to help you with any
 specifics as I haven't used it for a long time. got it packed away. I could
 get back to you later if you like.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) there are at least three programs here that do a better job
  than TERM, and all the other programs have better species here.
(Tom W.) Well what I want is a term emulator that has an printer echo.
 Term bombs badly, any names of progs for starters?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tom, what is the emulator for?? Won't the built-in Telcom with
  ECHO do the job??
(Tom W.) What Echo ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Press the F5 key whilst online and the stuff will go to your
  printer if it is parallel.
  dig it Tom??
(Tom W.) well I'll be!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) teee heeee ...


(larry l) has anyone seen a recent copy of PICO lately? I havent been able to
 get one for months.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I have the June issue right here and the 1986 Directory of
  Briefcase Computing which came yesterday. Not likely to find on newstands
  though. Mine is prescription.


(RICH L) haha....has everyone seen the 102?
(larry l) nope
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope. local RSCC is supposed to let me know as soon as
  received, but not yet.
(RICH L) Atlanta got them in Monday; you have to look twice ta make sure
 they're not a 100.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Model 100 = Good/Better/Best buy.
(larry l) i heard they moved the system bus to the back, I guess that means you
 cant use a standard PCSG RAM and such productS.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Correct; see T102.TXT in DL 6 for details on the Model 102.
(RICH L) yep, and the rom compartment has moved and there's room for 1 8 k ram
 chip; the function keys or sorta like the 200...backwards from the 100.


(jshad) does anyone know of a program for an IBM PC that will allow a model 100
 to run as a remote terminal to use the IBM for say a spelling checker etc?
(Mike A.) [Disk+..works over the phone] Disk+ comes on ROM for the M100 and the
 IBM gets a disk to complete it; the M100 screen looks like a "main menu" where
 you can send files to the IBM. also, you can call your IBM (with auto answer
 Modem) and send and receive files over the phone.
(Sysop Tony) Also, see the file REMOTE.IBM in DL6.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, file transfer <> remote terminal. Correct??
(Mike A.) yes, not quite the same!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, were you really looking to use the Model 100 as a remote
  terminal, or did you just want to do file transfers with the IBM?
(jshad) i wanted to download a file to the IBM and check the spelling,
 then send the errors back so I could correct my document. I used to do this
 using a UNIX system when I worked for AT&T.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) In that case best option would be file transfer to IBM,
  correct the document, and transfer corrected copy back to the Model 100.
  See FLTIBM.DOC and FLTX.DOC in the DL 1 database for easy file transfers in
  direct connection.


(larry l) I bought an AJ microdrive if anyone is interested.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sorry, but if you want sympathy get a dog!
  [tee hee]
(larry l) I sent it back..
(Sysop .^Dave^.) HAR deee HAR HAR !!!!
  Why larry?? explicate!!
(larry l) It seemd to conflict somewhat with my PCSG Ram and too cumbersome.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Better than a tape cassette, which ain't saying much.
(larry l) I use my Apple to store files and software and I think I'll stick to
 that.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Reasonable if traveling plays little part in your needs etc.


(jshad) Has anyone used the Disk-Power software from Ultra-soft??
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, appears that folks are still awaiting it.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Folks, let me take this opportunity to ...
  ANNOUNCE
  THAT
 responding to many requests over the years .....
 The Model 100 SIG ....
 will commence ...
 this Wednesday night ...
 a regular conference at 10 p.m. EDT with Tony hosting casual get together
 whilst the Sunday conference remains as is. comment Tony?
(Sysop Tony) No, we'll just open up Wednesday night and see what happens.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Lotza luck having lotza fun ....
  COing the 100 way ...


(Mike A.) Could I expound a bit on OUR sale ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) ga As long as not COMMERCIAL !! ga
  tee hee
(Mike A.) er, uh....
 well, Chipmunk's at 399,
 RAM expansion's down to 349 (from 425).
 the 6 ROM Bank is 199 (66 $ reduction),
 and the free ROM with Super ROM offer goes thru 7/31 (biz analyst).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Of course, the ESSENTIAL thing to do is update DL 6 files.
  Right? Right!!!
(Mike A.) right !!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, have you PERSONAL experience with the new pbase to any
  degree? I'd fear losing hours of work between faulty pbase and CRC errors in
  CDOS.
(Mike A.) I haven't used the new 1.4 pBase, I must admit. But your CRC errors
 concern me, this is with a new machine sent by Larry ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup, and your 3.4 CDOS installed later.
(Mike A.) Harumph !  and good disks like Sony, eh ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Memorex
(Mike A.) Well, I'd reccomend trying a Sony or Apple 3.5" disk, and check
 with Joel Corley at PCSG once I get ya a new disk !
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, and most files are on Apple disks. Is 3.4 essentially
  same as 3.45 ??
(Mike A.) I don't think so, error correction was the main thrust of .45,
 so maybe....
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just noticed you said "3.5" disks"; could THAT be the problem?
(Mike A.) been using those 5" disk,m eh ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I've been using Tandy 6000 Xenix compatible disks !!!
(Mike A.) AH HAH !
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No wonder Eutie Chipmunk looks cross-eyed and mumbles!
(Mike A.) Well, let's try a  CDOS 3.45 and/or 1.4 diskware.  
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, if'n 3.45 was error checking corrective then that could
  be critical. I'm advising Lady Stamp to maintain her multi-thousand mailing
  list in small chunks and back up.
(Mike A.) sounds like good advice ! and maybe backup the backups.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) As in two folders on each of two disks.
(Mike A.) Hard to beat redundant redundancy
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "This airplane is operating under full computer control ....
and nothing can go wrong ...
nothing can go wrong ...
nothing can go wrong ...
nothing can go wrong ..."
they said.


(RICH L) I hope everyone got there copy of Traveling Software Cat #1.
 they have some neet stuff.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) not yet. Both Portable Computer Support Group and Traveling
  Software got shorted in PICO's 1986 Directory of Briefcase Computing with
  maybe 20% of their offerings listed.
(RICH L) the T/S cat has there Disk drive like R/S....229...comes with..
 ts/dos and power supply.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, saw them when I was at T/S office and stockrooms last
  month. A Brother is a Brother under any name. Purple Computing has'em too.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Conference closing five minutes early ....
  Stay around for yak-yak ...
  with ??? and @@@@ or #### if you wish.
