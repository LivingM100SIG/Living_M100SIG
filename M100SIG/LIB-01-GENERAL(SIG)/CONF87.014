(DAVE DIKMAN) Well, just a question on printer compatability.
 Off hand do you know if M100 can work with xerox or "diablo" printers?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Dave, if a printer has a standard Centronics parallel port
  (most do) then there is no reason why they won't work. Similarly, if they're
  serial printers, then a connect through the Model 100's RS-232 should present
  no problem.
(Phil W) I agree with what Dave says; and I have worked with a Diablo 630.
 But that is only the issue of printing.  Most of the commercial (and some of
 the software here) print processing programs will let you operate the print
 features such as Bold, underline, etc. also. 
 [If you have a choice, go parallel -- easier!]
(DAVE DIKMAN) any special cords necessary for the linK?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If parallel, the cable is sold by Radio Shack
  for the Model 100.


(Larry L) As a service tech. I was wondering if you had heard any stories about
 people having their m100 serviced.  I have the m100 tech manual and most of
 the parts seem common.  Does RS also keep a supply of ROMs and other
 proprietary parts?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Currently on the message board is a problem that Dave Mitchell
  has been having getting his serviced, and I've got the impression that
  Service Centers' first reaction to a Model 100 problem is to replace the
  mother board.
(Phil W) Right on!
 But maybe you were asking if you can buy the parts. Probably so thru National
 Parts (?).  On the other hand if you were asking if there is a market for
 someone servicing these things, I suspect so -- 'cuz most of us don't want to
 buy a new mother board to replace a faulty cap or IC!
(Larry L) My experience has been that 70-80% of failures are in the ICs.
 As long as the ROMs are available you should be able to fix most problems.
 Apple on the other hand is very close with propriatary parts, which can be
 infuriating.
(Phil W) Suspect Tony Anderson will be able to answer this better.  I think he
 has worried some about getting parts at that level.  Issue is whether they
 will sell the discrete components on the boards.
(Larry L) I guess my question is: How reliable is the M100? It seems to me that
 they are very reliable.
(Phil W) [very!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep! From June '83 to Jan '85 Mortimer got not less than six
  hours use per day and I think that is heavy use for a portable; never gave me
  the slightest problem ...
(Phil W) [ 4 lbs isn't so heavy]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) he spends a good bit of time amusing himself now, so I can't
  say he's had three and a half years of constant use. But still no problems.


(Eric S.) Speaking of Tony, chatted with him a while back, and he told me that
 he had just received this copy of TS-RANDOM but hadn't had the chance to look
 at it yet.  Anyone heard anything from him about it, or do any of you have it
 and have any comments about it?
(Phil W) Well, this is a tall order, almost like a PRD file.
 How about asking somethin a little more specific. 
(Eric S.) Well, first off, does the thing ACTUALLY work?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [If you turn the Model 100 on!]
(RossR) [Aegh !]
(Phil W) Definitely! it does work! It has several features. Of course it will
 do file recovery and it does an excellent job; main use for me is if you trash
 a disk directory (TDD will do that on ocassion, with no help from you!).
 Its main function is as a new way to use th eTDD for rnadom access and it does
 work.  There is a sample application in the manual so far I have seen no
 others here.
 BUT -- I am not much of a Basic/disk programmer (do that on a desktop DOS
 machine) so I haven't applied it a whole lot. However, TS-RANDOM is the basis
 for their new product SArdine (a spell checker) and that really demonstrates
 the powere of TS-RANDOM conclusively.
 Don't need TS-RANDOM to run Sardine, tho.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) There is a RANDOM.* file in DL 13.
(Eric S.) Know about the stated features of RANDOM, was just wondering if there
 were any quirks that only users had found.  What about POWR-DOS from Acroatix,
 is it out yet?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Powr-DOS has been out for quite a while.]
(J.D.) Seems to me that Random by itself is more interesting than useful,
 though it does give programmers a new way to use the TDD. The important thing
 is that it gives Traveling Software a new advantage in future applications it
 may develop and bring to market. Also, there's some potential for Traveling
 Software to license it to other companies so they can build applications that
 access the disk in a random kind o' way. Assuming it works with the TND,
 it should add flavor to new commercial applications.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Is "TND" your phrase for TD-2 or is that the OFFICIAL frase?
(J.D.) [thought we'd agreed on that. behind the times as usual.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) You could be correct! Maybe Tony DOES have a lock on TND !!
(Phil W) I pretty much agree with J.D.  Definitely for programmers, so far as
 the Random itself is concerned.  POWR-DOS is available, at least for the M100
 it is a bit more in the mainstream, in that it works with standard TDD files
 as created with FLOPPY (RANDOM does not, but comes with TS-DOS which does).
 It is really hard to compare POWR-DOS & TS-RANDOM because they are really very
 different. Both do file recovery, and I find one more useful at times and the
 other at other times, and so on!
(Eric S.) When RANDOM makes use of a file on disk, is it actually a file,
 or do you just access records on a disk, not in a specific file.
(Phil W) Records. It does not use the normal file structure. and the disk
 is formatted in a different way.


(RossR) I've been buried at work and out of touch with SIG so need some help on
 new navigational techniques. If I want to leave messages can you direct me to
 the help file for how to do that these days
(Sysop .^Dave^.) FORUM.HLP, MESSAG.HLP in DL 1 and type NEW, press ENTER,
 at the Function prompt; really not that many changes in navigation.


(RossR) what would best place be to list Model 100 and several
 accesories/goodies for sale
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Section 14 is specified for that purpose.


(RossR) I have only been subscribing to PCM for last six months which hardly
 has any coverage for M600. Has Portable 100/200/600 been doing a good job of
 that in recent 6 months such that it wouold be worth getting back issues?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good grief! Portable 100 magazine hasn't been covering the
  Model 100 much less the 600! No issues!
  More 600 information is available here than everything so far published.
(RossR) Was afraid of that fate for that magazine.


(RossR) Is there a new publication called Laptop User and if YES where do
 I sign up IF it has coverage of the Tandy 600.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See MAG.100 for the address and signup; it is FREE but will
  NOT cover the Tandy 600.
(RossR) Yes, very interesting I was wondering if it was J.D. newest endeavor
 if it is its worth it anyway !


(RandyZ) I'm a member of the auto racing forum and am just learning
 my new 100. I have a (quest) to use the 100 to score local auto races much
 like a ski race would be; is there anything around to help?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Randy, the only program that comes to mind in the same ball
  park is REGATA.* in the DL 4 area in that it scores a sports event.
  Methinks you might be able to diddle with that code for your needs.
  you also may be interested in some of our timer programs in DL 4.
  Stop watch and lap modes. Check S/KEY TIME* for possibles.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Onward to the waiting "Laptop User".
(J.D.) Ok. Hesitate to respond to rumors, but have started to hear a nasty one
 lately. Some folk seem to think that since Laptop User accepts money from
 those vendors in the market who advertise, it will lack editorial objectivity.
 Three points to make. First, all magazines accept money from advertisers. Has
 no bearing on editorial. Second, Laptop user has received no investments from
 any company. We HAVE collected some prepaid advertising from a few firms,
 but all firms are eligible to participate (they get a break on ad prices if
 they do). Finally, seems to me that any magazine without objectivity is doomed
 to failure because readers can't trust articles and advertisers won't support
 someone who won't give 'em a fair shake. I wouldn't.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Haven't heard nary one rumour of that ilk or any other.
(J.D.) Thanks, Dave. I hate to respond because it just gives rumors more
 validity than they deserve; but this one has some potential impact on our
 ability to publish and continue publishing, so wanted a response
 on the record; not necessary to worry too much about it, let's get on with CO.
(Phil W) Nothing of the sort heard here either, JD.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay "on with CO" !!!


(Gary P) Im new to Tandy 200 and want advice on expanding.
 is 2 24 chips best route 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See EXPAND.RAM file in DL 13 for starters. Note that with
  expansion in that way you'll still have access to only 19.5K at a time.
  That is to say, 24+24 <> 48 contiguous RAM but in "Banks" that you switch
  to/from.
  As far as I know, there isn't a 200 user present this morning to help.
(Phil W) There are some new products which do not fit inside the machine.
 From the messages on the Forum, it would be best to stay away from those
 until they have been fully tested by other more adventuresome users!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) RAM expansion in EXPAND.RAM is reliable.
(Gary P) Yea that what i wanted to know from users.


(Gary P) any 200 users know if std is built in tele. pkg or other?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) For the 200, the "standard" is the built in Telcom unless you
  have special needs and write/use another terminal emulator.
  We have XMODEM.200 to enable error free file transfers from computer-computer
  or computer-BBS or computer-information service.
  Be aware of DL 10 devoted to Tandy 200 special needs.


(MIKE H.) wonder if someone can help; when i use two machine driven
 programs my 100 seems to lock up, why?? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) They are fighting to occupy the same space at the same time.
  Let me suggest FLIPML.100 in the DL 7 database; the FLIPML.DOC is very useful
  even without the program!
  Allows you to load/unload just what you want to use.
  Not a 100% cure, but a mighty big help!!
(MIKE H.) also would the prog on rom help? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) When using a ROM with it's programs there isn't going to be
  the same conflict/problems. Note that when using FLIPML there are lines that
  must be customized for individual use. Don't run it and scream " it don't
  work!!" without reading and complying with the documentation!!
  Many have done so!!


(MARTY) are you familiar with vt100.100?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not really; I'm told it works and I toyed with it when it
  first became available.
(MARTY) I'm trying to communicate with DEC Vax and cannot get in with
 Model 102; cursor just goes crazy. any ideas or suggestions?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, but methinks that you probably need to use some commands
  on the DEC Vax also. That is: /pad nn:nn  of one or more parameters.
  But I really can't help you beyond that; I know the Vax needs to know you
  wish to use VT100.
(Phil W) You may also want to look at TRMCAP.DOC in DL3.  I believe it is for
 use with a VAX Unix system; a way to tell it how to look at your M100.
 May be another file along these lines, too.
(J.D.) Sometimes simplest answer is true. Racing cursor often results from
 mismatched baud rate.
(Marty) is unix, Sperry, NCR, & Forturne equip compatable?
 [Editor: loooong pause]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Guess we don't know either Marty!


(O.T.NEW) ON THE PRinter stuff,does the parallel printer ooccupy the 232 port?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope! Parallel printer uses parallel port. The one marked
  "printer" beside the modem connection.
(O.T.NEW) gotcha. what is state of art printer for 100 usuage?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If for use in your home/office, rather than on the road,
  shop for best buy in Epson compatible printers which allow most flexibility
  et cetera. If needing a portable printer, then the "state of the art" seems
  to be the Diconix. Expensive!
  The TTX-press is a fine portable if'n you can find one.
(J.D.) Lots of folk seem to use Star Micronics; because of price I think.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Portable?
(J.D.) Nope. Lightweight AC. Smaller than FX-80, but not portable.
 Still, Star has occasionally tried to sell it specifically to the portable
 market because of transportability.
 [Gemini 10X 120cps dot-matrix = $179 via mail order. Epson compatible.]


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Then we seem to have come to an ending for this edition.
  Thankee all ...
  and bye bye!!
