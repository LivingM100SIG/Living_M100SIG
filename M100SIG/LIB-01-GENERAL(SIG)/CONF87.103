(Phil) Hi Gene, I got the duty this am. How are you?

(GENE NESTRO) My usual great self!

(Phil) Well, does anyone have a burning topic or question?

(GENE NESTRO) Did you see  a prog. called "DMPDMP".BA"?  I u/l it ir I think I
  did.

(Phil) Hmmmm  Seems like I saw something with a similar name, but not here
  guess it would/should be in DL2, it it's here.  When was it?

(GENE NESTRO) Probably Wed ot Thurs

(Phil) Well  maybe there were some issues re checksum or something.  Did
  you leave a msg to Sysops saying it was uploaded -- and did they reply?

(GENE NESTRO) No

(Phil) well

(R Caley) what?

(Phil) I can't be of much help.  Sonetimes theyt will miss them if you don't
  leave a message -- but rearely.  Any more Gene?

(GENE NESTRO) No I'm done

(Phil) go Steve. Your turn.

(Steve Jolly) Tnx.  Morning, all.  I've just replaced my LCD on my M100.  Just
  curious if a broken screen--or missing pixels is a pervasive problem?  Are
  other people as careless as I am, and is there any point in uploading  my
  experiences in replacing the LCD-- Tandy has made a replacement available
  for less than $200--aroumd $150, if your local dealer is an affiliate and
  will discount.  Comments?

(Phil) There dieinitely IS a point.  Call it FIXLCD.TIP and put it in DL8.

(Steve Jolly) Thanks, will do.  I'll upload later today.  Have a good morning.
  I'll stay in background and watch for a while, but that's all I ad  all I
  had to say!

(R Caley) [phil, I  got probs. can you see me here?]

(Phil) I have coptured some of the recent messages [Yes Rush!]
  in a file HWPB02,THD available soon at your corner forum!

(R Caley) ok  I was here earlier  and was getting lots of "/"'s on my screen
  also, I gave a "q" after Gene and you ignored it so i thought i wasn't
  getting thru.

(Phil) No I just did not note it; but scrolling back  it did come thru.  Note
  that I am putting backslashes in my lines for editing purposes.  Maybe that
  confused things!

(R Caley) ok..I gues that was it.

(Phil) But what was your earlier 'Q' Rush?

(R Caley) It had to do with the backslashes.

(Phil) Aha -- well I was planning to make that note, but I had not gotten to
  it.  Turns out that transcripts I make here are hard to edit so I put the
  backslash in so it can be replaced by (Phil) in the  edited transcript.
  Else Denny complains!

(R Caley) all done for now.

(Gary P.) I'm new... just bought a 600... my question is it worthwhile to
  by a basic chip.. and why?

(Phil) well there are several programs (don't know how many) for the 600 in
  DL11 that require the chip.  personally I am a programmer and would not be
  without a language in my computer but it is a personal chooice.  You should
  take a look in DL11 at some of the TIP and THD files, and also grab the CAT
  file(s) there.

(Gary P.) ok. thanks. will do

(Phil) Ok , you're up, Bruce

(Bruce Maret) well, ive been trying to download...can someone tell me whaqt im
  not doing right ?  im on a 600... trying to use xmodem and i cant get the
  system to start a transfer

(Phil) OK  Bruce, the basic files for the 600 & comm here are TEL001.600
  thru TEL005.600 in DL11.  You can simply read and capture them  without
  using the xmodem protocol If that does not do it, leave a msg on board and
  Tony can help he has/had a 600

(Bruce Maret) ok, thanks much.

(Phil) But Gary, have you mastered xmodem on 600? Maybe you can help Bruce.

(Gary P.)  I haven't used xmodem yet...just captured data

(Phil) Ok.  I usnderstand that the 600 is a "bit" harder to master, but lots
  more powerful when you do. Now we have no one in the queue.  Anyone have a
  topic?

(Gary P.) one comment... in TEL001.600... keep 7 parity and even until
  your user id. the change to 8 parity and "none" for xmodem it's not too
  clear in thew examnple.

(Phil) Tks, Gary -- Gene, anything to add?

(GENE NESTRO) NO

(Bruce Maret) any idea why i cant sign on with 8 bit,no parity?

(Phil) Ah  well you have to tell Compuserve that you are doing so  by setting
  no parity in your defaults.  See the file DEFALT.HLP (DL1) for info on this
  topic.  Then go to CIS-9 and do a fix (if that is how you ALWAYS want to
  come in (I do it that way at 1200 baud) note that the system will store a
  different setup at each baud rate you use.

(Gary P.) Well... I use script for auto logon and I use 8 Bit no parity
  only for this sig and 7 bit even for general logon.

(Phil) Any more on this, Bruce?

(Bruce Maret) yes  all i get is garbage when i try to get the host computer.

(Phil) yes, that is because it thinks you are at 7 bits, ignore parity and
  you are at 8 bits no parity.

(Gary P.) well  I think TEL001.600 thru TEL004.600 tells it pretty well
  tho I did leave a quetion for Tony on one point before I  got it
  straightened out. I'm not good enought to answer a specific question.

(Phil) [gee, I wonder if anyone here is NOT using a 600 <grin>!]

(Bruce Maret) but this was before signon, shouldnt the host adjust itself to
  my settings?

(Phil) Nope!  it will if you tell it ahead of time what they will be when
  it sees your ppn, all the grabage will disappear, and 'Password:' will be
  in the clear.  Gene -- did you have new topic earlier?

(GENE NESTRO) No. I was wondering if anyone tried the prog "Locate.BA"?

(Phil) I have not -- tho it looks like a good one if you are doing M100 --
  IBM conversions.  Kinda a companion to EXPAND.100. Did you upload it?

(Joe B.) thanx  anyone got much experience in the op of the new  Boost4er Pak
  from tsi?

(Phil) Not too much, here Joe  some of have done a bit with it, and there is
  one support file XH-BP.100 in DL3.  Any specific questions?

(Joe B.) ok, I was wondering how to tell where I've put a document in which
  directory after I've created them, put them into a directory, and then,
  have actually forgotten which of the many  directories it's it?  what
  a memory, huh?  thot that's why they made computers!

(Phil) yes  BP is quite a device, with all that memory.  In the PC's we
  have utilities to do that (WHEREIS.COM,  for example) which will tell you
  which directory a file is in.  Very much OS dependent.  I suspect you should
  call Gordon Shaw at Traveling SW and ask if he can write a pgm to do that.

(Steve) TNX.-- Phil, I will take your advice and will upload the info. on
  changing an LCD under DL8 in a couple of days I had a bunch of replies from
  people  with smashed screens, and a few calls and so it's apparently of
  interest.  By the way, a use you guys might be interested in.  I use my M100
  for "desk-top publishing" using the local copy shop's Mac and laser
  printer by preparing all my text, then just "dump" through RS-232 at a high
  baud speed and I can use the $$$ and time to make it look good and print it
  out, rather than tying up their machines while I type it in.  Great for
  newsletters, business, etc.

(Phil) Yes, it's amazing what these computers will do.  I've done some
  pretty nifty things with my M100 + T-WORD and a laser printer -- without
  needing any other machine at all!

(Steve) I'll look up T-Word.  I do a little page-setup programming directly,
  from time to time, in the M100.  I'm using SUPER_ROM, and probably could
  use  it more effectively but haven't thought it out.  Well  Thanks, guys,
  I'm moving back into the DL's.  Don't break any screens!

(Phil) BTW, Steve, it is amazing how many broken screens there have been!
   Your file will be welcome. 

(Steve) Quick additional comment I gotta feeling that lots of people have
  broken their M100 screens in the past, looked at the cost (around $450-500
  in the past, before Tandy got reasonable) and decided not to use it anymore!
  Kind of curious how I might get word out beyond the M100 SIG that it's
  do-able.  Might get some M100s back into the community and into use I can
  tell you that I'm buying a protective cover ASAP!  Anyway, TNX again, and
  I'll upload next few days.

(Phil) Maybe a letter to the editor: Portable 100 & PICO, at least.  BTW,
  folks...

(Steve) Ype.  Yep!  Will do. Bye!

(Phil) I don't have the slides, but if  you want to see them, get the file
  LOGO.THD (DL1) getting slim around here!  Ted do you have a q or c?  If not
  I vote for stopping early.

(Ted) Fine with me check you later

(Phil) Steve?

(Steve) yes!

(Phil) OK -- I hereby declare the CO at an end.  Thanks for coming, guys!
