(Sysop tony) Good morning, Phil.

(gene) morning all

(Phil) Hi -- just playing with some macros  Hi Gene

(Sysop Tony) Hello, Gene.

(gene) and me, using them for / (slash) commands i.e, /NOECHO.  Hi Tony & Phil

(Sysop Tony) (Where's my Sysop Macro List?)

(gene) OPPS /NOECHO.  I have it!

(Eiji) good morning

(Sysop Tony) Ah yes  I'm gonna work on a change to the F7 BRK function in the
  200's TELCOM.  I never use it, and what would REALLY be useful,
  is to have a form feed for the printer there. ... That way, when I  download
  several files, I can put a form feed between the listings.

(Phil) [Disloyal, not using XMDPW5 just now]

(gene) Have any of you ever checked prices  on Compu-Store? I did & they are
  great.

(Sysop Tony) For example?

(gene) I wanted to get my 2 kids Radar Detectors
  the small Cobra. The lowest price I found was $1.00.  ON C/S $61.30
  [was $100.00]

(Sysop Tony) I'll take it for the dollar.  Oh ...

(Phil) [$1 sounds better!]

(Sysop Tony) you upped it right before my eyes.

(gene) fastttt

(Sysop Tony) Well, there are a world of unexplored things on CompuServe.

(Sysop Denny) [Hi Folks]

(Sysop Tony) Hi Denny.

(Phil) [They charge the rest of the price to your phone bill <grin!>]

(gene) [he he]

(Eiji) [doesn't C/S require annual subscription fee?]

(R Caley) [Hi Guys]

(gene) yes, but I think it's a lifetime fee

(Phil) Don't think so.  [not annual]

(Eiji) I see. that sounds better.

(gene) about $18 - $24. I forget

(Sysop Tony) Lets see... $24 and $64 = $88. ... Still a little savings over
  retail.

(gene) I ordered 2.

(R Caley) [2 what?]

(Phil) [Initial regist. free with M100 mdm cable]

(gene) radar detectors

(Sysop Tony) How many modem cables do they expect you to buy? (grin)

(Phil) When I bought my M100 mdm cable in 1983 for 19.95 (the internal
  connec cable) it included free hour and regist on CIS.

(Sysop Tony) (How does it connect "internally"?) ... But he's talking about
  the fee to use Compu-Store.  Anyway, I already HAVE a modem cable.

(Phil) [Oh! Nevermind!]  [dunno]

(Sysop Tony) The current "snap pak"  Includes a $15 time credit.

(Phil) [better deal]

(Sysop Tony) Well, they figure you can learn enough about the system  in 2 1/2
  hours, to become a regular user.  You know the system does require some
  learning.

(Ron) n

(R Caley) [n?]

(Sysop Tony) Yep. .... "n"  ga Ron ga

(Ron) I am using XMDPW5 and it hangs up when I leave Xmodem  after downing a
  file  also it does not give you split-screen. Can Phil fix this?

(Sysop Tony) Ah. .... Well, the expert is here.   ga Phil

(Phil) Well, not likely.  If you are having this  problem consistently, it
  must be a bad copy or some such thing Need info: what computer, 100 or 102?
  Are you running it at the high end of RAM, or is some other M/L program in
  there with it? And when you try to do split ccreen, what are you doing and
  what ...

(Ron) I have a 32K M100 w/SuperROM and PG RAM expansion(3 banks)

(Phil) happens?.  Note that I have seen NONE of what you report, so  it must
  be in your set up or your copy.  Oh yes -- do you have the latest version
  of XMDPW5?

(Ron) I tried it twice and after each download it does not respond  to
  anything except F8. I downloaded XMDPW5 last week.

(Phil) Hmmmm ...

(Ron) I am using it now also.

(Phil) could be a conflict with SuperROM, which I have not used it with.  let
  me go off and fire up M100 with SuperROM and test.  Will get back on this in
  a while.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Ron, you have two separate problems there ...

(Ron) Can I "unhook" XMODEM and use split-screen and DIRACC only?

(Sysop Tony) One is that you cannot complete an Xmodem download
  and second is that you have no split screen.

(Ron) No. I get a good download

(Phil) Has  anyone here used xmdpw5 with Srom?

(Ron) I can't exit Xmodem except by hitting F8.

(Sysop Tony) Ron, there is a version that has Split Screen without Xmodem.

(Eiji) I have Super ROM in 100, and it worked ok.  I don't have any RAM
  expansion, though.

(Sysop Tony) What was the filename for that, Phil?  Was it TEL101? 

(Ron) Anyone know why the split-screen works on this SIG only?

(Sysop Tony) The split-screen capability will work in all forums, since the
  forum software ...

(gene) [Phil must be busy..TEL101 is correct]

(Sysop Tony) is common to all forums.  As I said, there is a version that has
  SS without Xmodem. 

(Phil) [yes ..goin to fire up M100; bye]

(Sysop Tony) TEL101 is the file name.

(Ron) Maybe I got a bad copy, but the download showed NO ERRORS  I was on the
  Religion SIG conference last nite and the split screen didn't work  It just
  showed previous page (F1).

(Sysop Tony) It's impossible for us to determine why it didn't work yesterday,
  in  another forum.  But did you remember to use the /NOECHO command?  And
  ...

(Ron) Yes.

(Sysop Tony) did you use the Shift-F1 to do something or other? ...

(Ron) Shift-F1.

(Sysop Tony) And did you have the label line on when you entered the program?
  Ron, I can't postulate if you keep interrupting.

(gene) I was going to comment on label line

(Phil) OK  I've missed some of the recent stuff, but I'm in now with XMDPW5
  with SuperROM and 0menu (8 bank RAM) and all is fine using splitscreen and
  just did an xmodem download with success.

(Sysop Tony) Phil  I think I know what the problem was  Ron mentioned he
  pressed F1  then clarified with Shift-F1, and got the previous screen.  that
  says he wasn't in XMDPW5 at all.

(Phil) Well  then he should not have Xmod over key 7 or Norm over Key 8.

(gene) Ron  make sure the Label Line is visible  (prev  etc) & then F1/Shift

(Sysop Tony) Phil...

(Ron) I am going to download XMDPW5 again.

(Sysop Tony) When you enter XMDPW5, does the label line show up on first
  screen,  Or does it go into Split-Screen immediately?

(Phil) It shows up on the first screen ...

(Ron) I get the label line

(Phil) in the 200 version, just the opposite, but it is mainly a SS  pgm and
  defaults to that.  XMDPW5 is used for SS as a "secondary" function.

(Ron) I use split-screen in conference only.

(Sysop Tony) Ron, if you downloaded it with Xmodem  and got no errors to
  begin with, then you got a clean copy.  No need to download it again, unless
  you want to get the latest version.

(Phil) Ron ...

(Ron) So why does it hangup?

(Phil) you say Split screen does not work and then that you use it ...

(Sysop Tony) My first guess is operator error.

(Phil) only in Conference.  Clarify. Has itr ever worked for you?

(Ron) It does not work on the Religion SIG conferences.

(Phil) [Well, I built that feature in! <just kidding!>]

(Sysop Tony) There is no reason for that to be true, Ron.  They have the same
  software running there that we do here. 

(Ron) It is working now,though. (Very nicely I might add).

(Sysop Tony) If it works here, it must work there.

(Ron) I didn't.

(Phil) Hmmmm!  how do I get there to try it?

(gene) Is there a need for Xmodem anymore on this SIG? I haven't used it for
  2-3 yrs Is there a need for Xmodem anymore on this SIG? I haven't used it
  for 2-3 yrs Is there a need for Xmodem anymore on this SIG? I haven't used
  it for 2-3 yrs

(Sysop Tony) Watch it, Gene!

(Phil) [We heard you, Gene!]

(gene) what was that? without ever having a bad download - even on GEnie

(Sysop Tony) The need is still there, depending on how good your local phone
  lines are. 

(gene) OK

(Phil) [Besides it's "techie"!]  How do I get to the ...

(gene) [triple Macro!]

(Phil) religious place Ron is speaking of?  [to do a test!]

(Ron) GO RELIGION.

(Marty T) A related question

(Phil) Ok -- will go try now. bye

(Sysop Tony) [Or GET RELIGION!]

(Marty T) When I tried to install the T-200 version  of split screen, I got an
  "ov error in 6" Repeatedly across my screen and then a cold start  Any
  ideas?

(Sysop Tony) Yes  You probably didn't have enough memory space to load the
  program or you had a conflicting program in the loading area  or you didn't
  get a good download of the loader program.  Try again, the program loads and
  runs fine.

(Marty T) I'll give it another shot
  And clean out a bank competely before hand and see if that helps. thanx

(Ron) I loaded XMDPW5 below TS-DOS
  Could this be the problem?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that could be the problem.  Wish you'd have mentioned it to
  Phil earlier. 

(Eiji) If I remembers right, I had to set HIMEM before loading, otherwise I
  got error.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, of course.  You always have to set HIMEM before loading a
  machine language program.  That's covered in the step by step DOC file.
  More Eiji?

(Eiji) done.

(Phil) OK  Just tried xmdpw5 in GORELIGION CO area and it works fine  looks
  like an operator error.   But keep us posted, Ron

(Ron) Sorry, Phil (sheepish grin)

(Phil) Now gotta go do some shopping. Could not park  yesterday!

(Sysop Tony) Phil, Ron loaded XMDPW5 under TS-DOS.

(Marty T) [glad you found religion Phil]

(gene) [Compu-Store!]

(Sysop Tony) [tee hee!]

(gene) [no parking worries]

(Phil) Ah! that should explain it!  True!  CUL later.  Bye!

(gene) cu

(Ron) Where SHOULD I load XMDPW5?

(Gary D.) See ya, Phil!

(Craig) is ANYONE ON LINE

(Sysop Tony) Ron, try removing TS-DOS, then load XMDPW5.  Yes, Craig. Use the
  /UST command to see.

(Ron) Wilco.

(Gary D.) Thanks  Am using TEL200 for SS, but also have SORT.CO in same
  bank SORT is at 60103, so subtracted difference to get new HIMEM  setting
  for TEL200. SS works fine, but after signing off, SORT is then garbarged!
  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  Using TEL200 without removing SORT from the executing area.
   It appears that too many folks, not just you, Gary.... are forgetting  that
  the machine is not designed to support using more than one machine language
  program at a time.  When you load two or more, there are probably going to
  be conflicts.  In almost every case of cold starts attributed to machine
  language use,  it's almost always been traceable to conflicts with other
  programs, existing programs or seco}ind programs which were also loaded.
  Folks should get in the habit of using one, clearing it, using the next,
  clearing it, etc.  No cold starts,  No garbaged programs, no problems that
  way.   It is especially true for those who are not machine language
  programmers, and who cannot modify or redesign programs to live peacably
  together.

(Gary D.) I see  In other words, always do the ol' CLEAR 0,MAXRAM first ...

(MIKE) HOWDY

(Gary D.) and THEN do the new clear for the other .CO program you wish  to
  run. Right? 

(Sysop Tony) Yep.  That eliminates the problem.

(Gary D.) Many thanks.

(Ron) Agree  With TS-DOS at 57000  and XMDPW5 at 52906(top 52999)
  How do I clear for XMDPW5?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know where XMDPW5 is supposed to load.  But where ever
  that is, you type CLEAR 256,X, where X is the load address.

(Ron) Correction XMDPW5 top at 56999.

(gene) Carl Oppenxxxx has a .BA program in Dec Port 100 ...

(Sysop Tony) (Oppedahl)

(gene) for finding address of .CO prgs. Did you  see it ?

(Sysop Tony) Probably.  I don't pay much attention to what is published in the
  magazines.  Did you have some specific question about the program?

(gene) mite be helpful for some siggers  No ?

(Sysop Tony) It's just as easy to run one of the RAMDIR programs, which tells
  you directly where the programs (all programs) are located.

(Gary D.) Or ...

(Ron) Like CHANGE.BA

(Gary D.) just do a LOADM"xxx" and the screen will give you the addresses
  for that particular program!

(Sysop Tony) Yes, where the program is supposed to load and execute.  but not
  where it is stored when it is not loaded.  I think that's the thrust of
  Carl's program, since the load address info would be readily available. 

(gene) Why can some be CALLED & others not?

(Sysop Tony) It can only be called, after it is loaded.  There are lots of ML
  subroutine-type programs that are LOADM'ed from BASIC, and then executed
  with a CALL to the executing address.

(gene) I'll have to try again. I CALL from exe add. & some will, others
  won't could be they are not Loaded

(Gary D.) Gotta run...[Hope Phil remembers what I want for Christmas! [grin]

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  You have to have it loaded, before you can CALL it.

(gene) Thank You

(Sysop Tony) Just wave your magic wand, Gary.

(gene) Magic Macro Wand!

(Gary D.) That could get me arrested!

(gene) Is this Gary Davis?

(Gary D.) Yessir.

(Sysop Tony) Yes

(gene) May you always know the Magic of happiness!

(Gary D.) And the same to you all, my friends!

(gene) Gene Nestro here

(Sysop Tony) And don't leave home without it!

(Gary D.) Good talkin' at ya, Gene, Tony, et al  I'll try to be here more
  often, but my ...

(Ron) Keep it clean,Gene.

(Gary D.) travel schedule has been awful lately. Have a good one and I'll see
  ya later!.

(gene) thanks for staying so long (grin)

(Sysop Tony) Editorially speaking, ...
  While the Model 100 and 200 versions of split-screen TELCOM
  software achieve the same end results, they are really very different
  programs.  Phil has added all the goodies to the 100 version to make it a
  fully-featured telecommunications program for the Model 100, rather than the
  basic split screen TELCOM enhancement James Yi started with.  Phil's versi}ion
  called TEL101 in DL3 is closer to the original program idea, and would have
  far fewer problems with it's operation.

(gene) RE:Tel101  M100  altho not doc ed, F7 will take you to Text.  instead
  of Shift/F7

(Sysop Tony) Well, that's probably because of all the ...

(gene) [latest version]

(Sysop Tony) playing around with the various versions that Phil has been
  doing.  You might want to let him know about that.  He might want to take it
  out unless there's a way back, ala' DIRACC.

(JIM) Does anyone sell a  ROM for communications?

(Sysop Tony) No, I don't think so.  TELCOM is pretty useful as it is.  The
  main enhancement would be adding protocols like Xmodem or Kermit and that
  can be done with a RAM program.  Don't think anyone has}put that sort of
  thing in a ROM.  Although Traveling Software might - they have a 1200 baud
  modem for the Booster Pack, and that might have ROM software.

(JIM) What Rom do you use?

(Sysop Tony) None.

(Sysop Denny) [did I hear Booster Pack?]

(gene) NO

(Sysop Tony) No.  Go back to sleep.  Any other questions, Jim?  Guess not.
  ..... ga Mike ga

(JIM) No thank you.

(MIKE) Speaking of communications, I need help with ...

(Sysop Tony) (Guess what?)

(MIKE) A thermal printer problem

(Syop Tony)  (Surprise!)

(MIKE) The problem is after about 500 characters it scrambles

(Sysop Tony) Which Thermal printer?

(MIKE) A cheap Cannon

(Sysop Tony) My guess is that it doesn't have a very large internal buffer,
  and that it doesn't send an Xoff signal to stop thei computer }ifrom sending
  data when it's busy.  In such cases, the data overflow can
  look scrambled.  Possible fix, get a printer buffer to hold the data flow.

(MIKE) BASIC suggestions?

(Sysop Tony) In BASIC, put in a timer loop to slow down the data being sent to
  the printer.

(MIKE) Thanks, I'll work on it.

(Ron) Speaking of printers  I took a little ride on Tandy's new laser  I was
  using the Write ROM and doing a simple mail-merge  and it seems that every
  copy seemed to be starting at a lower line on the new page  This padding of
  lines continued until a new page would start around the middle of the page
  We tried everything! IBM control codes HP LaserJet codes  Nothing worked!
  Other WP's run into similar problems e.g. WordPerfect,PFS Professional Write
}i  Any ideas on why this bug afflicts the LP1000 laser?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's possible, and a common problem among printers that
  have an "automatic" skip over perforation feature.  which conflicts with the
  word processor's "hard line" output formatting.  Also, I'd expect a printer
  from Tandy to not work with anything normally.  They have a track record for
  that sort of thing.  There should be a way to shut off the automatic skip,
  however.  If there isn't, then Tandy ha}is brought out another incompatible
  product.

(Ron) I understand that HP has a similar problem  Has anyone run the WriteROM
  with an HP LaserJet?

(Sysop Tony) Probably.  but also probably, since there are only a half-dozen
  members here probably no one here has done so.

(Jon D) [Hi!]

(Sysop Tony) There is a similar problem with the Epson printers, where the
  auto skip is considered 6 spaces.  Three at the bottom of the first page,
  and 3 at the top of the second.  When folks upload DOC files that are hard
  lined, for just the right number of lines per page,  each succeeding page
  moves down by 6 spaces.  I suspect that there is a way  to disable that in
  the printer, or a way to compensate for it in the software.  although I'd
  suspect that many software writers do not take into consideration the
  problems the software might have with specific printers.

(Ron) Tony, I have no problems when I do a merge on my Tandy DMP130  and the
  same codes work on the LP1000 except for that line padding bug
  could there by a problem with the laser printer in general  with the way the
  load and store data?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  Well, not being connected with Tandy Corp, or having any
  information on how the controller ROM in the printer works,  Not having seen
  one, and not knowing what the printer codes are,  and not having dealt with
  a Tandy printer or a Laser printer,  I have no idea of why there is a
  problem there, or what you can do to fix it.  Suggest if there is a problem,
  don't buy the printer.

(Ron) done.

(Jon D) [what IS the current topic?]

(Sysop Tony) No topic at present.

(Jon D) Well, I'm using SS for first time...also my first CO!  I can afford to
  be here 'cause I'm on free with the time I got from the contest.  I like
  this Anybody had any more comments or developments with XMDPWx?  ga...anyone

(Sysop Tony) No, not anyone. ...

(Jon D) sorry

(Sysop Tony) Remarks are addressed to the moderator, who recognizes the
  speakers in turn.  The latest version is XMDPW5, and I thnk therewas a new
  version uploaded this week. {_ To fix an obscure bug.  You might check to see
  if you have the latest version.  Since the Split screen programs have
  been available, they have been the principle topic of conversation in CO.
  Check some of the previous weeks transcripts in DL1 for continuing
  commentary.

(Jon D) Ok, will do  Anything else interesting been happenning here lately?

(Sysop Tony) No, you can see everything that happens on the message board,
  and have access to all the files that have been merged,  and can read the CO
  transcripts.  That's all there is.

(Jon D) ok, don't know of any particular question I have.  ..done

(Sysop Tony) OK.

(Ron) So long, guys. Gotta run.

(Sysop Tony) So, Jon.  Have you been downloading EVERYTHING with uour free
  time?

(Jon D) Everything I can use, or think I'll use  I've got some new ideas for
  things to do....OH!  I know Is there a SRC available anywhere for DSKMGR???
  I'd like to try to add some stuff to it

(Sysop Tony) How many disks full have you got so far?  I'd check with Phil to
  see if he has a SRC file available.  I don't think ...

(Jon D) Only 5 or 6, but I plan to do a lot more today thru Tue

(Sysop Tony) there is one available in the DL's, but Phil did rework it for
  other machines, so would know.

(Jon D) I use CS ASMBLR.CO....?

(Sysop Tony) So do I.  So does Phil and Denny.

(Jon D) That's what I thot...know where it is?

(Sysop Tony) Where what is?

(Jon D) the SRC for DSKMGR
  [which DL]  ?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, as I said, contact Phil to see if it's available.  It's not
  in the DL's.  It's copyrighted by James Heilman.

(Jon D) Ok, misunderstood.....must have flown past me
  one of these days one of us <or several of us,> are gonna have to try to
  get a public domain 0: style PDD DOS worked up.

(Sysop Tony) Matter of motivation, I suppose.

(Jon D) yes....

(Eiji) This is for Jon  Since you have free time, get all the .CAT files and
  INDEX they're good reference for looking up files in DL's.

(Jon D) agree.  Already have the INDEX, and have looked over several of the
  .CAT's

(Sysop Tony) We're getting so much in the DL's, it's getting hard to keep
  track of it! It's all Eiji's fault  (grin)

(Jon D) I've got DL's 1 thru 7 pretty well cleaned out...

(Eiji) It's better than not having any new files.

(Sysop Tony) (yep)

(ron) I just tried SS in Religion SIG  and it works fine!
  It seems that you MUST have the LABEL on  before you hit Shift-F1

(Jon D) [that should be in the DOC]

(Sysop Tony) Yes, you must have the label line on.  That's mentioned in the
  DOC file.

(ron) My apologies for wasting everones time.

(Sysop Tony) No problem.  Well, we're at the end of our scheduled time.  Does
  anyone have any final thing? 

(ron) So long!

(Jon D) [Oh, already?  I just got here!]

(Sysop Tony) Two hours, Jon.  Starts at 9 AM Pacific, (noon Eastern) and runs
  for two hours.

(Jon D) Oh, well, I should have rushed home from church a little
  faster....when's the next contest?

(Sysop Tony) Next Contest is scheduled for next summer.  Don't have any idea
  about the prizes, though.  We got a windfall from Gary Davis this year.  But
  hopefully, it will be an annual summer event.

(Jon D) Ok, well, I guess I'll let us quit  too bad...I was looking forward to
  a little more conversation Maybe another time......bye!

(Sysop Tony) Bye  Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.
