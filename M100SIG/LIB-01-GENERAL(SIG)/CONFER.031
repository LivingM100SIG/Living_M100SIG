(larry l) How much does it cost to use cis from europe?
(Sysop Tony) Basic rate = $6.25 per hour plus any network charges.  Plus any
prime time charges.
 I didn't see the "from Europe"...
 Mucho!!!
(larry l) like how much?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) larry, at times I've seen prices quoted but I just don't
  remember. Off hand, I'd say $15-$20 was what I heard but could be more.
(Sysop Tony) (1200 lira per minute from Italy)

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Eiji, what gets you up so early???
  Planning to attend LAUGH meeting Eiji?? 
(Eiji) I missed this CO.  Sure, I am going to be there for LAUGH. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good OH!!!

(rowlfe) you guys wanta version of backgammon and a version of Monopoly both
 written, or rather translated, into Microsoft basic from another dialect??
(larry l) yes!!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sure 'nuff !!! And we have a member just about ready to send
  us a cribbage game for the 100 tooo .....
  Rowlfe, were you aware that FORTH for the 100 has showed up here in your
  absence??? Mike Weiblen has done it again!!!
(rowlfe) [interesting...]
 The games need quite a bit of cleaning up yet, but they both work and play
 reasonably fast. haven't had and will not have a chance to optimize much, so
 each runs up around 18k or so. promise to have in the mail by Friday.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) would you like me to use Custom Software's BYTEFYTER program
  on it and delay publishing for a day or so checking it out thataway???
(rowlfe) Sure. If I had the program I would!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay!!! Will do!!


(larry l) Does anyone have any experience with the A&J microdrive? it uses
 streaming tape.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) one was in my house yesterday and t'was interesting to see the
  major change in the wafer tape since the Holmes wafer drive. Didn't have much
  chance to play, but I think the Tandy disk drive is a far better option
  (if Chipmunk is too expensive) due to support and expected growth.
  The AJ is a dead end really. No place to go; a mass storage device ONLY with
  not that much capacity.
(larry l) if you mean support to be eventual sale of prog on disk i see
 what u mean, but i just need storage now.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) More than just the idea of programs on disk, but the support
  in terms of enhancing the original product and getting it to work!!!
  We have dozens of files here in support of the TDD and we have five
  for the AJ.  That is what I meant.
  There are public domain disk manager programs for the TDD and at least three
  commercial ones either available or about to be available.
  That is what I meant.
(larry l) is any of those drives the best
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Huh?? "any of those drives" do you mean the programs???
  or do you mean TDD versus Chipmunk??
(larry l) any recommendation for a drive?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If $$$ is not the problem the Chipmunk is definitely the way
  to go due to read/write virtual random access and a great future ....
(rowlfe) [after seeing one, I also agree.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.)  the TDD will grow into more than a super cassette recorder,
  but can never approach the Chipmunk's capability due to the inherent weakness
  of the built in OS but t'is the drive of recommendation on limited budget.
  On a very limited budget, the AJ makes a lot of sense but methinks most folks
  will end up by upgrading to a real drive,
          or getting rid of their Model 100 too!!
(larry l) are the two media compatible..tdd>chip?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope!!! No compatibility at all!!!
  Would not astonish me if sumbaudee came up with a program that would allow
  the Chipmunk to read a TDD disk but not the other way around.
  NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE!!!


(BOB S.) I've been having trouble getting Heilman's DSKMGR to boot up and
 operate on my system.
(John s.) Me too!!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Bob, are you having the problem of trying to run the .CO
  program and just getting BEEP and return to Menu??
(BOB S.) yes, that's right 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Aha!!!!!
  This will occur with many .CO programs and the simple way to handle it is to
  go into basic and use the command ....
  LOADM "DSKMGR"
  or whatever the program name is; you will then get the addresses of the file
  and an OM error message.
  Say the "Start" is 58900  Now you just use the command
  CLEAR 256,58900
  then return to the Menu and the program will run. Good idea to maintain a
  Basic program that will handle that for you. Also, see FLIPML in DL 4.


(John s.) I get an FC error rpt. trying to change via CHANGE.BA
 WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) for us to help we need to know more details ...
  FC in what line ??? after issuing what command ??? working on what file ???
  and who dated your sister last night ???  et cetera.
(John s.) Working on DOSHEX, don't remember line# , but the command was just
 highlighting DOSHEX, as per CHANGE.BA INSTRUCTIONS.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Without the line number we can't look at the code to see what
  is going wrong, but it sounds to me that you were asking CHANGE to work on a
  file that it can't handle. What is extension for DOSHEX and what is DOSHEX???
  Not in my index.
(John s.) DOSHEX is the name suggested to download DSKMGR. DOSHEX.DO,
 that is. I was having error report problems w/xmodem.312 also,
(Jim (TX)) Could it be that John here stripped too much off the
 DSKMGR file. Did you take the numbers from the beginning and end??
(John s.) no ...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony?? I'm not acquainted with DOSHEX
(Jim (TX)) Guys. DOSHEX is DSKMGR
(Sysop Tony) Neither am I. I downloaded it once. Followed instructions.
 Converted it with CHANGE and it worked fine.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John the thought occurs to me that you may have sump'n stuck
  in HIMEM giving you problems when CHANGE and XMODEM try to do some PEEK and
  POKE and CALL work; suggest you do CLEAR 256,MAXRAM ....
(rowlfe) [or something corrupted in the DOSHEX file, mebbe]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) try again, without FLOPPY loaded for instance ...
  and if necessary do a cold start and try again. If still no luck then leave a
  message with details, including line numbers ...
  and the number of pork chops you had in 1977.
(John s.) I've been clearing 256,maxram to avoid what you're describing. I'll
  go thru my routine again, take notes, post a message w/details and MAXPORK.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) also be sure to use DOWNCK.WM3 on the DOSHEX first!!!


(markN) I found a LISP emulator written in basic a short while ago on a cp/m
 bbs but a couple of lines had gotten trashed. i haven't had time or
 inspiration to it working as yet but if someone else wants to give it a shot
 i can upload if there is interest.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Mark might leave a message on the board ...
  Since we seem to be faring FORTH guess we can try to LISP limply too.


(Roman K) Is there anything in the library about connecting epsons to the 200?
(Sysop Tony) A number of such files. Mostly in DL0. EPSON.HLP is one of them.
 Try looking with the keyword EPSON.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) John S is next but I'll anticipate and say that DOWNCK.WM3
  is in DL 4 and is a program that reads a .DO file to verify it is the same as
  the author uploaded. There is a "Checksum" in the file description of DSKMGR.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Next week I'm going to make a stab at starting a series.
  "Basic programming" next week ....


(John s.) About xmodem. Which, if any, of the xmodem versions in the dl's
 is preferable?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) XMODEM.312 by far in my opinion.
(rowlfe) [concur. use it regularly]
(John s.) I was afraid of that.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Use DOWNCK on that too!!


(SCOTT FIGGINS) ok i was wondering if anyone knew of a disk program for
 the 3.5" drive that could be used in telecommunications
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Which drive?? TDD or Chipmunk?? 
(SCOTT FIGGINS) tdd
(Sysop Tony) DSKTRM and an external modem will allow you to simulate
 downloading to disk, which is what you are probably trying for.  right?
(SCOTT FIGGINS) well yas and no I would like to be able to still be portable
 and is the model 100 capable of a task using both the modem and rs-232
(rowlfe) [nope.]
(Sysop Tony) The Model 100 is not capable of receiving data via the modem,
 and sending it to the RS-232 port at the same time.


(PaulS) Regarding CALLS to BASIC: Is there a GENERAL way to execute a BASIC
 command and then RETurn to my MACHINE CODE program? [anybody].
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Nope.]
  Anybody??
(PaulS) [ah well... nice try, huh?]
(markN) should at least be able to do basic command ...
(PaulS) [oh boy, oh boy]
(markN) and poke call into command buffer to get back to ML pgm (maybe ??)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mebbe, but doubt it. Paul, what you must needs do is:
  1) See if Waite's "Hidden Powers of the Model 100" can help ...
  2) See if Oppedahl's "Inside the TRS-80 Model 100" can help ...
     [when it becomes available late this month]
  3) Experimentalize the 100 way ....
(John s.) Any idea where I could order those books?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Try Walden or Dalton ....
  Oppedahl; Weber Systems, Inc.; Cleveland, Ohio 800-851-6018
  the ISBN = 0-938862-31-6
  and then the Waite stuff is New American Library; 1633 Broadway
  New York, N.Y. 10019 --- best I can do for you ...


(JOE BARK) have you heard if U-rom II is being shipped for 200 yet?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Haven't heard but doubt it ....
  Tony?? You notice 200 stuff I overlook.
(Sysop Tony) (Yes we've heard... No it isn't)
(JOE BARK) any reviews on how it will differ from urom?
(Sysop Tony) Two weeks away yet.... (maybe)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Doesn't have spreadsheet but the 200 has one anyway.
  May be a toss up therefore, as far as 200 is concerned.
  [Editor: Dave thought Joe asked for Super ROM vs U-Rom II comparison]
(Sysop Tony) (Reviews not generally available until unit is available)


(GENE NESTRO) Comment: I've been reading for about 2 yrs now about dowmloading
 etc. 'Xmodem' etc. & I'm perfectly happy with built-in sofrware in the 100
 as far as d/l from BBs...  any one else feel this way?
(>Joe B.<) (me too!)
(Sysop Tony) (Me!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) from my viewpoint, the main need for XMODEM is on the part of
  the author/uploader to ensure a good upload, and on the part of the sysop to
  make sure that the file is a good one. XMODEM upload also permits program
  line lengths up to 255 characters which permits some program enhancements.
  However, for downloading purposes alone, if Telcom works, why bother with
  XMODEM?? Of course, in some situations you may need it but ...
(rowlfe) I usually use xmodem to get the program part, but then only if I have
 noticed noise on the phone line prior to connect. The main reason why xmodem
 got written was the poor quality of long distance connections, which has
 since improved greatly. However, there are still pockets of bad "connections"
 all over the US where it will save connect time, since it senses errors and
 asks for the block to be transmitted. If you have a clean line, you probably
 will never need it at 300 baud, but at 1200 or now 2400, the situation of
 noise garbling data is again on the rise.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) N'other point: A long HEX file that has to be converted to
  machine code could cause MUCHO problems with an "A" received as an "F" or
  a 0 becoming a 1 or whatever ...
(rowlfe) [if'n it is glitched, you have to download it ALL over again, too!]
(GENE NESTRO) I use it for HEX files and am completly satisfied. I also notice
 it seems to run about 450 baud which I relly enjoy. I'm pne of the users that
 Xmodem.312 crashes Floppy.Co but with Flipml.Ba there is no conflict.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Glad to hear that, no need for FLOPPY and XMODEM
  simultaneously.


(markN) back to john s's q on call to basic command from ml...
 aren't most basic commands ended w/ a ml return?  0c9H or simular.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mark, that stuff is beyond me entirely
  and I wouldn't know a 0c9H from a H9c0 .....
  sorry 'bout that ...


(Sysop .^Dave^.) END of conference ...
  Next week, be prepared to talk Basic ...
  All go to Yak-yak mode now.
