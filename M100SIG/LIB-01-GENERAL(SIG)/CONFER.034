(Sysop .^Dave^.) ARe we ready for chat about what you have on your mind??
  TOPIC: open.

(BILL T) I got a Tandy 200 and in the office we got a IBM pc; the IBM is hooked
 up to a NEC printer and the NEC printer toggles are set for the IBM and hard
 to get at.... question: how do I command the NEC printer from my Tandy 200
 to give a CR/LF without taking the entire machine apart to throw the toggle.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See LFEED.200 in the DL 4 database.
(BILL T) that's my bbbiiiig headache... thx.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) tee hee!! nutt'n to it ...
  thanks to the many members that contribute so much here.
(Sysop Tony) (a blooming 200 expert!)


(GENE NESTRO) I just acquired a COCO and am considering "Disk+" anyone have any
 experience with "Dsk +"?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes Gene, I've used DISK+ with the Model 4 and it it is right
  fine product. Easy to use et cetera. Keep in mind that storage is the object
  there, nothing else. Heard many others very pleased with it.


(GENE NESTRO) is there any problem keeping the Ser & Par ports on printer
 in line at the same time? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, lost me. Are you trying to print to a serial printer
  and parallel printer simultaneously??
(GENE NESTRO) no just one at a time as the dips are very handy.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) There should be no problem then, though you'd have to switch
  your software commands; for parallel, we normally use LPRINT but for serial
  it would be PRINT #1 after something like "OPEN COM:88N1E" FOR OUTPUT AS 1
  or whatever.


(Jay M.) Does anyone here (don't all talk at once!) have any experience with
 Joel Dinda's FLIPML program? I'm having some strange results when trying to
 use it in conjunction with DSKMGR. the KILL function refuses to work and the
 memory free value doesn't reflect the drop in memory after DSKMGR (or any
 other ML program) is loaded.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Lotza folks are using FLIPML with delight.
  1) are you POSITIVE you have the DATA lines for DSKMGR correct with proper
  addresses ???
  2) Have you gone over FLIPML.DOC carefully??
(Jay M.) I've read the DOC file about 3 times now trying to figure out what the
 problem might be, with little success. I checked the DATA line against
 manually LOADMing DSKMGR, and it checked out. Afterwards, I noticed several
 places in my ADRS.DO that had gotten clobbered; assuming FLIPML doesn't go
 clobbering memory (safe assumption, I think), then maybe my problem isn't
 there. I just realized why the memory available value only changes by 100
 bytes or so: the .CO file goes away when it's loaded into high memory. (hits
 self upside head). 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) COLD START and start all over. If there are still problems,
  leave message for Joel et alia ...


(Paul C.) nice to see ya'll...am on a 600 here and have not been able to
 receive a bell/beep on CIS from other users or the system. the ^G does not
 sound the bell here (although I can send one). Do I have some parms set wrong?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That's right Paul. You aren't alone; no response from Tandy
  but that is an "undocumented feature" of the Tandy 600.
  Have you seen the *.600 help files in DL 1 and do you have Basic as yet?
(Paul C.) yes, I have the BASIC chip and have set parms per the TEL.* files.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I would just LOVE some feedback on the programs that I've put
  up for the 600 (in DL 2 especially).
  CHECKS.600 is the most ambitious to date but I'm working on DBASES.600.
  FEEDBACK please!!!
(Paul C.) Dave...I have most of that stuff, and will send comments to you.
 what hoppend to the Dictionary that Tony was working on? was that adapted to
 the 600?
(Sysop Tony) The dictionary was completed a couple of weeks ago.  It is not
 available for the 600 yet, as it was primarily a project for the Chipmunk,
 and is scheduled for conversion to the TDD next.


(bill b) My question has to do with optimizing hardware selection. I'm a writer
 of training materials, but travel a good deal. my old M100 has done good for
 two years but new assignments are causing me to wonder whether it isn't time
 to upgrade. I need information on the relative merits of the PCSG Multi-ROM
 and the SuperROM from TS; also thoughts as to whether it might be better to
 chuck the whole thing for a new 600. I use IDEA! extensively now, and like
 its features; also do a lot of phone xfers of files.
 Any input would be appreciated.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Third party support for the Model 100 continues to GROW,
  not junking time!! Note that Super ROM = PCSG product
  and Ultimate II ROM = Traveling Software; there are various options for
  expanding memory including RAM, ROM, and four types of disk devices but it
  ALL depends on your particular needs and pocket book. Specific queries??
(bill b) sorry bout product confusion...fingers often faster than brain.
 Yes, I know about the various hardware products available but wondered which
 of the disk drives, for example would be best for heavy word processing and
 telcom applications, and about interactive effects with the multiple
 ROM devices.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) T'is best with all disk devices to turn them (& OS) OFF when
  not actually being used. If the $$$ allows, the Chipmunk is the clear choice
  as it allows full disk read/write capability. The Tandy 600, by the by,
  should be bought ONLY after time spent in RSCC with hands on experience and
  making SURE the RSCC manager knows about 30 day return privileges.
(bill b) Agree about spending time in rscc before buying the 600 - now if
 only I could find an rscc with a person on staff who knew ANYTHING at all
 about the critter! Anyway, thanx for the thots. I will eventually make up my
 feeble mind. Just want to get it right without spending mucho dinero on glitz.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Note that it's most unlikely you'll be able to experiment with
  Tandy 600 Basic in the RSCC so you'll be missing out on some MAJOR features.
  I'm just beginning to learn to make Mortie 600 dance in Basic enabling much
  better use of the FILE software.


(Reid P) Anyone have any working experience with LAP-CODER from MuPsi?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Reid, yes and it's DEFINITELY an effective means of squeezing
  more space out of your TEXT file area. Note that it is NOT for basic.
  Get BYTEFYTER from Custom Software for that; but LAPCOD does a super job on
  TEXT files. Just received upgraded copy that handles Telcom better but
  haven't had a chance to use it yet.
(Reid P) Got BYTEFYTER & RENUM-great! Is LAP relocatable?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) uMMMM. I'll have to czech documentation but t'would be good
  idea to get into FLIPML habit.
  LapCod will load at the starting address of your choice.


(greg s) Is there a full size BASIC compiler available from anywhere?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, the ONLY compiler for the Model 100 that I've heard of
  is the one in the database here but it isn't "full size" in that it does
  a super job of number crunching and is fine for graphics and games, but can't
  handle strings as yet; we also have fig-FORTH but that is all.
(greg s) Also, thanks for your help over the past 15+ months!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike Weiblem seems to have slowed down on the compiler;
  but now that he has FORTH working with the Chipmunk's help maybe he'll be
  able to go back to the compiler. However, it DOES make the programs rather
  large compared to assembled programs.


(Jay M.) I cold-started, keyed in the infamous 3-liner, reloaded all the stuff
 from my PDD, used FLIPML to load DSKMGR, and executed DSKMG.
 it worked fine, the first time, is there an interaction I don't know about?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No idea Jay, suggest that you may have had a clash BEFORE you
  activated FLIPML originally. Fooling with .CO programs almost SURE to lead to
  problems without careful forethought.
(Jay M.) heh. I know all too well how much trouble you can get into playing
 around at the machine level. OK, I'll check (and, if necessary, retransfer the
 stuff.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) By the bye Jay, Sysop Tony is our TDD and DSKMGR person for
  help since I've no idea about either one of them. Don't have a TDD.
  Also Jay and everybody: for programs such as DSKMGR that are HEX to be loaded
  into .CO programs, let me URGE you to download with XMODEM protocol to ensure
  a clean copy. Freeze starts possible otherwise.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay folks! When I gawt back from Wash. D.C NECy meeting
  yesterday Carl Oppedahl's book was awaiting me.  A few comments ...
  has 78 "Tables" by my count with excellent organization of the entire book.
  Another 43 "Figures" which are mostly diagrams, and really impressive index
  work, though there are probably some errors there. Unlike many indices, this
  one refers to more than one page. Has one Appendix that give the page numbers
  for discussion of particular HEX addresses.
  Very well written, it appears, though over my head in large part ...
  Carl Oppedahl's "Inside the Model 100"; Weber Systems, ISBN: 0-938862-31-6
  8437 Mayfield Road, Chesterland, Ohio, 44026 Phone: 800-851-6018; is $19.95


(BILL ERIKSEN) My question was about the chipmunk...
 How durable is it in a briefcase, carried around etc?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Frankly, I haven't travelled that much with it but seems to me
  to be built like a tank.
(Rob D) Agree it is pretty much of a tank however, you should still consider it
 a precision instrument much like a camera.  Our company has a few for
 traveling auditors and two have had to be repaired after one year of use.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Thanks Rob, the camera analogy is a good one; if briefcased,
  neither the computer nor the Chipmunk should be able to shift around but
  should fit snugly. Mortimer 100 and Eutie Chipmunk ride very comfortably
  in a shoulder bag, akin to camera bags.
(DaveW.) Rob, were the precautions of keeping a blank disk or the original
 cardboard kept in the drive. Or were the problems unrelated to head
 mis-alignment?.
(Rob D) I think that the drives in question were checked through airports and
 not carried in the camera bags we bought.  for myself, I carry the munk with
 the card in the drive slot and pack some foam around it in my briefcase to
 absorb the jolts of routine travel. the problems were 1) a dead set of
 nicads and 2) apparently a bad ROM that trashes any machine that it is
 connected with.


(Rich L) I am now d/loading this session to my PDD using DSKTRM.100.
 Has anyone else out there used DSKTRM?
(Sysop Tony) There have been a couple of inquiries on the message board
 but I don't know of anyone actually using the program.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) we have found out over the years that folks RARELY say
  something positive about a file but comment only when they have problems.
  well over a thousand folks have downloaded some of our files, and nary a word
  has been said about them. Not even "Thanks"; so don't expect too much.
(PaulS) [Thanks]
(Rich L) I know how that goes.
 I've been running a BBS (on a Mod-100) since 84'
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Know about the BBS, be copyright careful!!!
(Jay M.) Just wanted to pass along my appreciation for all the help I've gotten  here. I know, from personal experience how much time goes into running a
 first-class system, and while I gave up, I'm glad folks are still around,
 willing to answer my silly questions.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) well, we enjoy it and at times enables us to be reminded that
  "Impatience begets patients".  One nice reward that makes me feel funny is to
  walk into a meeting, such as the NECy users meeting in D.C. yesterday, and
  have folks I've never seen know who I am immediately because of national
  magazine coverage; bad for the EGO though.
(Sysop Tony) Editorializing:  It really surprises me; we have literally
 thousands of folks who sign in regularly and download the goodies from the
 database, with nary a word of thanks or appreciation. Folks who write stuff,
 and donate it like to be acknowledged for their work and when acknowledgement
 is not forthcoming they tend to fade away. Some of our best authors no longer
 contribute.  And the time involved is not even recognized. It took me hours,
 for example, to put together that little file on CALLS. (Get off the soap box,
 fool!)  OK, back to you Dave
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Strongly disagree about authors fading away for that reason
  but am not ABOUT to get into a debate on  it.
(Stuart R.) Funny you are on this subject. I just got an E-mail thanking me
 for Blkjk.Rev. I expected a lawsuit from the company instead
(Sysop .^Dave^.) hee hee ...
  Corky Richmond disagrees with you very much and left a brief message,
  said he'd respond more when he gawt off his road trip, or whatever.


(Stuart R.) Also, I found a RS Computer Center in Santa Monica that has a large
 supply of TDD's.  The one at 5th and Wilshire
(Sysop .^Dave^.) they must be getting out now, which IS the time Tandy Towers
 projected.


(DaveW.) It is a little frustrating putting some of your best work on the
 Sig, seeing how many people have grabbed it and not knowing how they are
 getting along with it. You can only assume. "No news is Good news."
(Sysop .^Dave^.) One of my programs has been grabificated over 1200 times;
 not a word. And you are right on assumptions, Woods Martin at least gets cries
 of help from folks that don't read SPREAD.WM3 documentation!!!!

  Who know what "UART" means?? 

(Sysop Tony) In the original file POKES.100. It was downloaded over 800 times
 before someone mentioned that one of the pokes didn't work. However, I noticed
 a logic error in one of my programs I've uploaded, and it's had a lot of
 downloads, and no one ever complained yet.  Waiting to see before I fix it.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks a lot of folks download a lot of stuff and trash it
  without a word if it doesn't do what they expected.


(John R) UART = Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter.
 It's the gadget that takes each 8-bit byte and sends it a bit at a time down
 the RS232 line or to the MODEM.
(DaveW.) [just going to metion that myself John]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) How 'bout that John!!
  You agree with page 118 of Oppedahl's book!!
(John R) [Do I win a prize?]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And John R wins a Free connect day ...
  good throughout ALL of CompuServe ....








  30-Feb-1934
(Jay M.) (heh)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) JUST for you John!!!
(John R) [I'm speechless!]
(DaveW.) [Glad I didn't win. They'd probably fowl-up and back bill me for it.]


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Eiji, you're doing FINE work down there!!
(Eiji) [Thanks]


(DAVID E) I have been looking for the book mentioned on line here "HIDDEN
 POWERS OF M100"; WHERE IS IT?  IT IS NOT IN BOOKS STORES I HAVE BEEN TO.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) David, you probably would have to get Walden's or Dalton's
  to order it for you from the Waite Group; New American Library; author is
  Christopher L. Morgan and ISBN = 0-452-25578-3
(DAVID E) fine and thanks for all the programs I have been using from the dl's
(Jay M.) I found my "hidden powers" (sounds like a National Enquirer ad!) at a
 chain called the Bookstop. I don't know if there is one near you, Dave, but if
 there is, you might try them.


(Eiji) Is Oppendahl's book out yet? I ordered one about two month ago,
 but haven't herard anything yet. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes Eiji, I gawt it in the mail yesterday but it was
  complimentary direct from the author. Suspect that Weber will be busy filling
  orders now.
(Eiji) ok..  Shouldn't be too long then.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Would an upload of the Table of Contents and a few comments
  be suitable idea for DL 6 folks?
(DaveW.) [Sounds good to me.]
(DAVID E) [ME TOO.]
(Jay M.) [me too.]
(PaulS) [yeah, but dinna get sued]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hope this sort of thing makes more sense to you folks than it
  does to me. Quoting from an appendix.
  Quote:
  Decimal  Hex     8085 Opcode   8080 Opcode
  206      CE FF    ACI FF       ADC A,FF
  UNQUOTE
  Hope that is fun!!
(John R) Does he give the Z80 opcodes too?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep. Appendix C.
(John R) As you say, Machine language is fun. 
(DaveW.) [8085 is all you need.]
(Jay M.) [anyone for 370?]
(DaveW.) [should be 206 255 decimal.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) DaveW, gawt sump'n else for 255. Want it?
(DaveW.) You mean RET, Dave.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) no. HEX = FF, 8080 = RST 7, Z80 = RST 38

  AND it is conference closing time ....
  Sure 'nuff 'preeeeesheate all you folks stopping by.
  all go to Yak-yak mode now ...
  and enjoy!!
