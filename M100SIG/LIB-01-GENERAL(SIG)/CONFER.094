(Sysop .^Dave^.) {bleep, boop}
(Dave Peyton) Nice entrance, Dave
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well hello Dave! Super article! Nicely done! Congratulations!
(Dave Peyton) Thanks. Lots of comments on the board about it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, been about four threads. Just got mine Saturday.
(Dave Peyton) Saturday? They bring mail to Maryland via mule?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, butterfly! & they is caterpillars.
(Dave Peyton) heheheh The U.S. Snail strikes again!


(Leonard E) Morning, Dave. Any suggestions for DVI utilities?
(Sysop Tony) the best place to start, is the DVI.CAT catalog in DL5.  It lists
 all the DVI stuff we have, so it's the logical place to start the catalog
 files provide comparative descriptions of the files in that subject.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I don't have one. Ask for specifics and we can steer better.
(Leonard E) Well, actually, I was looking for ones to *be written* (ie what do
 people want)
(Sysop Tony) Oh... well in that case DVI disk utilities would be most welcome,
 but most computer utilities would be the same, anyway.   So, If you're looking
 to make a contribution, disk-specific info would be the area that is not well
 covered, yet.
(Leonard E) As in directory layout/modification/recovery or as in how to
 retrieve data from other machine's disks (M3/CoCo)?
(Sysop Tony) Yes, exactly... Name and Rename, fix sectors, etc. as well as
 reading other system's disks, although that meay be a bit more specific than
 most folks would need. I'd think, just DVI specific stuff.  But then, what do
 *I* know?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "Norton Utilities" for the D/VI methinks is needed.
(Sysop Tony) (Or "Erickson" Utilities)
(Leonard E) That is what *I'd* like to have too, but not what I'd care to
 *write*, but if it *has* to be done....
(Sysop Tony) There have been several request for a DVI specific word processor.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Huh? You mean sump'n other than the PRTEXT print formatter??
(Sysop Tony) Well, I've seen several msgs to the effect that folks couldn't get
 PRTEXT to work right off.  May need more DVI s[ecific instructions.
 But then, PRTEXT may not take full advantage of the screen, either.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Woods WROTE that for the D/VI and I'm firmly convinced that
  folks that are having problems don't understand how to handle their Model 100
  from the simple starting point.
(Sysop Tony) That may be it. I'm not a word manipulator, so haven't tried it.
(PhilW) Well, the real fact is that there is no word processor for the M100,
 et al. a WP would use the disk to let you edit files bigger than RAM,
 and both the Chipmunk and the DVI could benefit from such a thing!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Correct, PRTEXT is a print formatter, not a word processor.
(Leonard E) Well, I'd thought about that, but in BASIC it takes forever to do
 anything & Ml would make it DVI specific has anyone found out how to call the
 *generalized* OPEN INPUT & PRINT routines from ml.
 there isn't *any* text editor for the 100!
(PhilW) three points..
 One is that TEXT is a text editor...
 two is that T-WORD in UR-2 comes about as close to real disk support as
 anything, but ala ONLY for the TDD...
 and Yes, it would have to be in M/L, but Write and T-Word are so why not?
(Leonard E) TEXT is just barely adequate & I don't need/want a ROM bank so ROM
 programs are out (I've got Multiplan). Search & replace is a must, as is the
 ability to search for CTRL chars.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) SUPERA does about as much word processing as anything else
  I've seen.
  Okay, lets see what folks have to say after they've read the transcript.


(Terry G.) Can the UR-2 T-Word prgm be used with the D/VI in 80x24 mode
 without conflicts of m/l prgms?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Believe no, but ga Phil
(Sysop Tony) Unknown, have not tried that combination.
(PhilW) T-Word disk operations are TDD-peculiar.  But I do not know about
 display.


(Leonard E) Is it just me or is the 100/200/etc the only computer where there
 is a distinct difference drawn between "text-editor" & "print-formatter".
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmmmm, methinks I thought they were the same when I got here
  with my VAST computer experience with the PC-1 pocket computer.
  Now, I see that they are totally different on ANY computer.
  Methinks a real "word processor" is a full editor as well as a full formatter
  for printer output. The Model 100 has some editing capability and practically
  zilch formatting capability. methinks.
(PhilW) Even in the BIG world there are distinctions. Wordstar has both
 editting and print processing features; the dot commands in WS are really
 print formatter cmds, while on-screen editting is done via control codes ala
 T-Word
(Leonard E) Well, at least the 100 is the only system for which the standard
 "word-processors" are almost exclusively print-formatters. The only case that
 I've run into before was a program for using Wordstar file to drive a laser
 printer.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not that many "systems" come with an editor built in either.


(John M) Speaking of Word Processors, can anyone help with a SuperROM question
 before I call PCSG tomorrow? While in Write mode, a "^@" randomly appears in
 .DO files when the m100 is turned on.  This is intermittent.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmmm, 'member hearing about that problem but thought it was
  fixed in later versions.
(PhilW) I don't remeber that but it sounds like the precursor to a cold start!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Quite. John, you know you can leave a message here for PCSG if
  you prefer. Mike Anders is regularly on the SIG for support.
(John M) Good idea. By the way, I just received SuperROM this past week and,
 When I loaded it, I did not cold start the M100. Also, there had been at least
 one .co file installed prior to loading Super/rom.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) 70526,1715 is for Mike. Specify the Super version of
  Write ROM. CLEAR256,MAXRAM should be enough.
(PhilW) And tell mike which computer and version number.  You should not
 be having any problems like that! 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Quite, I thought you meant the old Write ROM.
(John M) OK. & Thanks.  I'll leave a message as you suggest.
 I'll try the Clear 256,MAXRAM first,  and then try a cold start.
(Leonard E) Just note that I agree with Phil. ONLY time I had random ^@ in
 files was shortly before files went away (but this was without any ROMs,
 just ml)


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Leonard, are you at all acquainted with SUPERA?
(Leonard E) nyet. only what I've heard on sig, & in ads.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mighty powerful little tool, see SUPERA.PRD in DL 6.
  And it should NOT be confused with Super ROM !
  Looking at the Manual, it says Search & Replace will handle "all characters"
  and goes into upper/lower case options et cetera. Howsomever, I can't
  remember trying to do control codes with it. If vital to you, I can test it.
(Leonard E) Oh, I can live for quite some time with what I've got.
 I can always run the file thru WS on my 8mhz 286 at work.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) With all the TDD interest, do you all think that having Mark
  Eppley here to talk about RANDOM-DOS as well as Acroatix about their new
  version might be worthwhile?
(Alan Rowberg) Their new catalog I got Thurs just blew me away.  I never
 dreamed that they had that much stuff.
(Sysop Tony) Sure... if they'll come.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Been here before, methinks he'll come again.
(PhilW) Yes, that would be an excellent idea.  But only after they have
 delivered some.  Wouldn't want to distract them from doing so.
 Does anyone have either product yet?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Concur. Would prefer to have some users present that had
  experience/problems/delight in product to respond too.
  I was under the impression that they weren't shipping as yet.


(Leonard E) Back on (old) subject of DVI utilities, would I be "safe" in
 assuming 80 col availability for users (note that *some* TVs can use it!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Woods Martin 70235,232 and Maddi Durholz 70466,1511 would be
  good folks to get D/VI feedback from.
(Sysop Tony) I would think the 80 column screen is the main reason people buy
 the DVI. 60% at least. the disk certainly is no big deal. So I'd guess that
 most folks who get one, also use a monitor in 80 column mode.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) some folks keep wanting to use D/VI with their Model III or
  Model 4P or whatever.
(Leonard E) "use" how?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Want to use the screen display. Not the disk drive.
(Leonard E) As I have a M3 as well as 2 100s(and other stuff) I can't imagine
 why they'd want to! But it would be far more trouble than it's worth.
 I *think* that it may be possible to interface it thru the 50-pin i/o
 connector, but it would require BEAUCOUP work on drivers & handshaking!
 (note that a DVI screen dump to printer takes about 2 seconds to dump the
 screen!)  (I've got a buffer so I *know* that that is m100-DVI i/o time)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Personally, kinda wondered what they would do with III's
  keyboard. 100 on top?


(PhilW) Has anyone seen the new (lets see, August!) P100, and is it still any
 good withe all the staff changes?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [resounding silence]
  Most likely the staff changes were not in effect. Note that J.D. evidently
  had second thoughts about his message, came back and deleted.
(Leonard E) I only glanced at a copy in the store. no idea. Anyone received a
 copy in the mail?
(PhilW) [you SAW one, and didn't buy it? may be the only one!]
(Leonard E) It'll be there next week.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) ga Tony, and take it for me please
(Sysop Tony) Got it!
 Leonard, Go down and by EVERY copy they have!!!  I will personally send you a
 check! We'll distribute them on the SIG.
 How many copies do you estimate they had?
(Leonard E) lessee now, 5th Ave had about 10 & B.Dalton's had 20 or so (at that
 store, others probably have similar amounts)
(Sysop Tony) Well, in that case, maybe not EVERY copy. How many do you think we
 could use, Phil?
(Alan) L, can you smuggle them down in a low-flying plane?
(Leonard E) Alan, from here it is *up* to Seattle!
(PhilW) well, I don't know whether you can distribute them too easily from
 Nevada!  Anyway some people will subscribe and don't mind waiting 3-4 months.
 Not at Dalton or Waldon down here (Torrance) yet.
(Sysop Tony) Well, *I* subscribe but never got the June issue. Probably never
 will, except that I bought a copy at the store.  Otherwise, my file of back
 issues would be incomplete.
 I'd think we could distribut a dozen or so, anyway.
(PhilW) [Quit subscribing long ago, for that reason]
(Leonard E) Well, I subscribe (and *bought* a June issue) and since AUG showed
 up at the same time as the new BYTE, I'll wait til I get BYTE in the mail
 before..
(PhilW) [but guys, it'a almost October, BYTE calender!]
(Leonard E) buying off the stand (at which point I will cancel my sub & request
 refund for Jun and for Apr/84)
(Sysop Tony) I think right now, with the changes they are undergoing, buying an
 issue if you see it, is a prudent move. Subscriptions aside, since we can't
 seem to rely on that.
(Leonard E) I heard a rumor that someone tried to cancel his sub & they
 *wouldn't*!!!
(Sysop Tony) Interesting.  ....
 Does anyone else have a pressing question?  or shall we continue
 flogging Portable 100?  By the way, it's back to "100" now.
 (tee hee)

(Sysop Tony) Actually, Leonard, I don't care for the DVI at all. I've got one
 to support it but wouldn't use it for my own use.  I prefer the 200 and the
 Chipmunk even though the two don't seem to work together.
 So I use the 200/TDD combo, and the 100/Chipmunk combo.
(Leonard E) well, it's the only 80x24 display I've got at home.
 And I originally bought it for the disks as much as for the display. Didn't go
 for the 'munk as I expected the DVI to be better supported. <sigh>
(Sysop Tony) Most DVI support has been from Maddi Durholz and Woods Martin
 although both are less than regular supporters as they are often not seen for
 weeks (there's a niche there, Leonard)
 if you want to actively support the DVI, I'm sure many folks who have them
 would appreciate same.
(Leonard E) I was going to say, other than screen differences (PRINT@), what
 are the usual problems?
(Sysop Tony) Well, as far as I can see that, and the SCREEN,1,1 stuff, plus
 whatever changes a program may require for screen layout of charts, graphs,
 or whatever.
(Leonard E) well, my first rule is *never* use SCREEN X,Y unless I *want* to
 force CRT or LCD. SCREEN ,Y works fine (and saves a byte!) (maybe that should
 be in a tip file?)
(Sysop Tony) Good idea... but seems to me, if a patch file is to convert an
 existing program for the DVI, you would want to include that in a beginning
 line somewhere.  Maybe a standard subroutine that would ask, "Wanna use the
 screen?  Y/N : " would be a good idea.
(Leonard E) well, right now I think a good idea would be to post a couple of
 msgs: one regarding desired DVI utilities & a second regarding programs that
 need mods to run on DVI. (pity we don't have some sort of "poll" function
 in the SIG software). That would give us a priority list.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep. Good idea.
(Sysop Tony) OK... go ahead and leave msgs... But you may get very little
 response. Suggest it would best be a project based on YOUR assessment of what
 would be most useful.
 Guess we gotta close CO for this week.  So, CO CLOSED.
