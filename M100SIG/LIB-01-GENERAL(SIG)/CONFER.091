(Sysop .^Dave^.) Anybody played with PLP files?? Into Graphics??
(larry l) I saw the PLP files in new listing this mornin. what are they?
 sometimes the descriptions of new files don't really give enough info on their
 content.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Larry, sounds as though you missed PROGRAM announcement last
  week; what is currently in X9 is modifications to that program and data files
  to be read by the program PLP100.CMZ is the current program soon to be
  upgraded to [ PLP100.PRG ]; the files with .MOD extension are enhancements to
  current program which allows much faster, easier exhange of graphics data .
  the PLP100.nnn files are display files to be read by the program which were
  also created by the program.


(george v.) I've been trying to track down a Model 100 tech reference manual. 
 All the local computer centers say that they can't get one for me.
 any suggestions as to where I might find one?
(larry l) I also had trouble finding one, finally found one in a store in an
 area where there are mostly business users..not many M100. if all else fails
 maybe Tandy would send you one directly.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No personal experience, but folks say call "National Parts"
  817-870-5600.


(DAVID E) Is there a command and location that tell you the current cursor
 location?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) POS and CSRLIN


(R Caley) missing last 2 issues of port 1/2/600. are they dead?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Supposedly they are around. June issue is lost to us evidently
  and August should be along; you should have received July though.
(larry l) spoke to them a few weeks ago...they have changed mailing houses and
 service should be improved. I got latest issue (Aug?) but not previous one.
 they said it will be along eventually.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I would suggest calling the Editorial offices and
  COMPLAINING !!


(Greg L.) I'm getting frustrated by the lack of a POP statement in M100 BASIC.
 Does anyone have a way around this?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [try MOM]
(larry l) [aarrgghh]
(DAVID E) [or DAD]
(Greg L.) urk.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Greg, youse has gawt the wrong sysop for assembly stuff.
(george v.) i was going to say that it wouldn't be too much trouble to write a
 small assembly routine to do the POP and call it whenever needed.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) george, if not "too much trouble" maybe you could whip sump'n
  up and leave it on the message board for Greg.


(john p) dave , a few months ago i pulled down a surveying program that looked
 pretty good. were you the one who made it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, that is so long ago that I've forgotten the specifics,
  but a fella sent it to me on tape because he couldn't get it going fully.
  The mathematics and algorithms of the thing are totally beyond me, but I
  whipped it into usable condition as far as screen display and such I think.
  Then I uploaded it under his User ID and haven't heard from him since. Is it
  really good?? I have no way to judge.
(john p) very nice piece of programming. it didnt need too much work to get it
 working as a good tool for me
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If'n you have an enhanced version, maybe your fellow
  engineers would like it too!!


(DAVID E) I would like to ask that a reminder of that people need to keep to
 the subject in messages. I use scan to look at messages and find the comment
 on a differt subject. I don't want to sound like an ***hole but computer time
 is money.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) David, know eggZAKlee what you mean but it is really tough to
  keep that straight; a reminder would be just a drop in the ocean.
  folks aren't comfortable with the UA command. The sysops here try to use
  their powers to change the subject line, which we can and do do, so it isn't
  as bad as it might be. For passing interest, the WORST place for folks not
  keeping with the subject is the Forum for sysops only!!


(G.Elman) Best kept secret is that D/VI now only costs $199 from Tandy.
 Just got Sept. issue of PICO magazine.  Has article about hi cost of M100
 peripherals.  Author quoted list price of D/VI at $499. How come the sale is
 such a secret?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well Gerry, magazines go to press three months before
  distribution. We have been reporting $199 here for months and it is less at
  some discount houses. Granted that the latest Tandy catalog, RSC-17, still
  says $499 but the RSCCs have been saying $199 for some time as we have here.
(G.Elman) Anyone here have a D/VI?  I've been having some problems and wonder
 if they're endemic to the D/VI or malfunctions of my unit.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gerry, be sure to czech out DVI.CAT from DL 5 for the fine
  D/VI support we have. Tony has one, Woods Martin and Maddi Durholz are the
  goooooorooooos.
(john p) gerry, a friend of mine had some problems using D/VI with SROM, had
 some crashes
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Suspect that SROM and URII are not intended to be used with
  D/VI loaded. Use'm one at a time as with the Chipmunk.
(G.Elman) Whose ROM is SROM?   I'm using plain vanilla 32 K M100. Often get LCD
 screen blackouts.  Find it difficult to get system reset even for cold starts.
 But when it works as now, lovely.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) SROM = Super ROM from PCSG.
(john p) I have been using SROM for a few months great piece of work.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gerry, it MAY be necessary to have your Model 100's Memory
  switch turned off over night to clear out some excess machine code garbage,
  but I'd suggest BRO of the DL 5 for tips and then leave a query on the board
  for Maddi or Woods with all the symptoms of the problem.
(G.Elman) Good.  I downloaded all the D/VI goodies from DL 5 over the last
couple of weekends.  Thanks for names of contacts.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Give me a second and I'll give User IDs ....

(richard) I have a question that i posted concerning our office wp system.
 i can't seem to get files downloaded and uploeaded without stripping word
 processing codes. the text i send up loses all formatting and the text i get
 down wraps around my screen since it is only 40 columns..
 will ultimate rom or lap dos work? the office system is "ibm compatible"
(Sysop .^Dave^.) richard, saw your message and it was pretty much beyond me in
  terms of my being of great help. Most likely the principal problem is that
  your WP codes are 8-bit and are being completely lost or being changed to
  7-bit. POSSIBLY the program UNLOAD.100 or FXTXT would be of assistance, but
  I suspect that you need a program that will transfer files without
  modification. X-TEL.CO from Sigea Systems may be the only one.
(G.Elman) I transfer by null modem between M100 and IBM PC.  Just got a demo
 disk from Sigea for their Telecommuter software.  What wp software does your
 IBM compatible run, Richard?
(richard) the office systme is "syntrex" a central file server system with
 terminals at various desks. the syntrex formatting codes are stripped when
 downloaded into the 100 and the 100 tab and paragraph settings are ignored by
 syntrex when uploaded. that's why i thought a rom chip like ultimate rom or
 lapdos would maybe help. all communications must be by phone lines not 232
(Sysop .^Dave^.) A ROM chip would be of NO help. If your syntrex system cannot
  handle XMODEM protocol, you are definitely out of luck. Quite certain your
  codes for the syntrex are ASC<32 and you'd have to have XMODEM protocol
  transfer to prevent loss.
(G.Elman) I've seen Syntrex files.  You're better off without all the
 formatting codes in your M100.  It would just look like a lot of garbage.
 An attorney with whom I was collaborating on a project used his Syntrex
 system to type a draft document.  I was able to get our local Syntrex rep to
 convert it to ASCII text formatted for IBM as a favor.  They have a utility to
 do that.  But their codes are unique to syntrex and would just be a mess on
 the M100.  However, I subscribe to Dave's thought about using 8 bits instead
 of a 7-bit transfer protocol, if that's available on you telcom software from
 Syntrex.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Dummy Dave didn't THINK of them not being ASCII files!]
(Sysop Tony) Richard, I, too, saw your original note and it looks like you have
 a problem that will require a technician to be on-site to solve, so he can see
 what's actually happening as well as making the necessary tests to see what
 can be done about it.  However, in the 7 bit mode, the Model 100 can send
 control codes, ASCII characters <32 by faking them into your file as graphic
 characters >128.  (See your manual for keys.) When sent as 7-bit, the 8-bit
 character is automatically converted.
(richard) would this prevent everything i upload with paragraphs, tabs etc.
 from turning into a large block of unformatted text?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope.
(Sysop Tony) I don't know. Not being familiar with your Syntrex at all. But if
 the problem is that you can't send Control Codes from the Model 100, then the
 faking it method will allow you to.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks that the key is the Model 100 is working/sending
  ASCII files and Syntrex is not.
(Sysop Tony) Another point is that your IBM equipment may be using the IBM
 EBDIC code, instead of the ASCII code.  They like to do that sort of thing,
 expecially with something that they think can be tied in with only IBM
 equipment.  (Make the customer buy only from us!)
(G.Elman) I think Syntrex uses ASCII alphanumerics.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks the summary is "talk to Syntrex folks."
(G.Elman) Richard's problem is the opposite of what often happens to me using
 WordStar. I would like to avoid "hard" carriage returns, which prevent
 reformatting when I've got the text on a video screen.


(G.Elman) Tony, Dave said earlier you have a D/VI.  I've been having crashes
 of my LCD screen (goes blank and stays blank) especially when connecting and
 disconnecting to D/VI but also other times.  Is this expected, or maybe
 do I have a cable problem?
(Sysop Tony) Sounds like you have a hardware problem of some kind --- may be
 the cable, or the monitor itself; doubt the problem would be in the DVI or it
 would be a permanent problem.  When you lose video, it would stay lost.
 You might also check the sockets.
(G.Elman) The LCD screen blanks out,  not video. It stays dead until I do a
 system reset, which isn't easy to accomplish, even pushing all the cold start
 buttons.
(Sysop Tony) Oh! I misunderstood your question. The LCD screen going blank is
 normal as the video display is transferred to the CRT screen, but as you F8,
 you go back to the LCD. It's one of the klunkiest ideas I've ever seen.
 You go back to the LCD for the menu, but up on the screen for whatever program
 you are in.
(G.Elman) No, I mean something else. Like when I've got the LCD screen on
 (screen 0,0 rather than 1,0) there's still no display.  Looks like the whole
 system has died.
(Sysop Tony) Have you had a power down?  When using the DVI you should set
 power = cont. 
(G.Elman) Pls explain. 
(Sysop Tony) Go into BASIC and type POWER CONT.  This prevents the computer
 from shutting itself off while you may, or may not have data on the screen,
 fooling you into thinking that everything is "on".
(G.Elman) Aha.  It may be that if I switch from one mode to another while it's
 in power down mode, that is what's locking up the system.  I'll try
 POWER CONT from now on and see if it prevents the lockup.  Thanks!!


(richard) does anyone have any general comments about the relative virtues of
 the various multi purpose rom chips. i.e.ultimate rom vs super rom etc.
 i'm new to the 100 and would buy blind 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Simply put, it would seem from members reports that Super
  is for those preferring a spreadsheet whilst Ultimate ROM II is for those
  doing a lot of writing; evidently the database managers are a toss up.
  No personal opinion.
(richard) what about "interactive solutions"?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, methinks you may leave that to the Indians, but keep in
  mind that both Super and Ultimate are sold with 30 day satisfaction
  guarantee. At least one regular member bought both with the intention of
  sending the worst back and he kept both!!


(richard) what about books, other than those at radio shack, to answer more
 complicated questions?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If you are technically capable, then "Hidden Powers of the
  TRS-80 Model 100" and "Inside the Model 100" are for you.
  The latter is VERY technical.
(G.Elman) I was going to mention Hidden Powers.  Havent seen "Inside".
 Do you know publisher or author?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Inside's author is Carl Oppedahl; Weber Systems, INC is
  publisher, 8437 Mayfield Road, Chesterland, Ohio, 44026 (800-851-6018)
(Sysop Tony) There are a large number of books that support the Model 100
 (et al) from various viewpoints.  You can review a list of about 40 of
 them in the file BOOKS.001 in DL6.  You should be able to order any of
 them at your local book store.


(Denny T) Tony, did you try out Leonard's call for auto logon with
 an external modem? I got it working quite well.
(Sysop Tony) No, I'm waiting for him to upload the promised file, since I
 don't really need it.
(Denny T) Ah, I incorporated it into a program that will also find a number in
 the ADRS file. It's only got a couple of bugs to work out now.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hi Stig! Did you know I'm just north of you above Baltimore??
(Stig) Nope.  Never CO'd Before. Just watching.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well watch this Stig ......
  Time to close this CO for the week!!!
(Denny T) tee hee!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Stay around to chat if you wish.
  We never close!!
  Formal COnference is ended.
