(Sysop .^Dave^.) Getting a new program ready to upload. Should be very popular.
  It tells time in plain English and is not in the LEAST concerned with
  accuracy. QTIME.BA is accurate to within three minutes!!
(Sysop Tony) Just wondering if you got your inspiration for QTIME from Peter
 St. Clair?  He was working on a program in BASIC, that, when run would give
 you a copy of the main menu. Which is about the same idea as a 892 byte
 program which would give you the date, time and day. !!!  (grin)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, inspiration came from Renato Reyes QT.COM for IBM
  compatibles but his program is MUCH more accurate than mine since it includes
  "just past" and "nearly" among it's time phrases.
(Sysop Tony) Cute!


(larry l) I just wanted to say that I have been using the m100sig for almost a
 year an I am very impressed with the caliber of programs available on the
 dl's. It seems as if they are every bit as good as the advertised programs.
 [I hanen't bought a program yet]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Very true larry. The only programs superior to those in the DL
  here are very specialized and/or in machine code as opposed to pure Basic.
  SUPERA, for instance, is one of the finest programs available and has nothing
  even approaching it's capabilities in the public domain. We have print
  formatters here that are very fine indeed.


(JOHN SHADEL) Just wondering if anyone has had a chance to try out MLOPSY.xxx in DL5. I downloaded it last Friday, and was just wondering if it worked.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I don't have a TDD, so haven't tried it yet. Methinks that
  Phil Wheeler will be sure to get back to you ESPECIALLY if it doesn't work!
  Any feedback Tony?
(Sysop Tony) No, not yet. I'm still trying to play with DISK POWER.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, that is one item that will slow down appreciation for
  MLOPSY. Many folks are just getting DP installed.


(JOHN SHADEL) I also saw that someone has left a comparison of different
 addressing between the 100 and the 102. Do you think this will cause some
 problems in program compatability between the two?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) It could very well do so, but thus far not one program has
  been found that is not compatible with the Model 102. Though I don't have
  one, I spent hours in an RSCC testing some of the more advanced stuff.
  102.INF in DL 6 has the report but the main thing is that SUPERA, Ultimate II
  ROM, Write ROM, and X-TEL.CO all are compatible.
(JOHN SHADEL) Ok - just curious ... thanks for your insight.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Other programs tested were those that INP and OUT stuff that
  calls strange places. POOL, for instance, and BUMBLE are compatible.
(Ralf Burghart) I don't have the 102 at home, but can test it in my office
 tomorrow.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Ralf, we are fairly certain that it is 100% compatible
  except for some very special programs using the upper range of the CHR$()
  where there is Spanish symbololgy available on the 102 but not on the 100.
  Doubt if any 100 program would cause a 102 to crash.
(Ralf Burghart) Well, the 102 is already sold in Europe with all the national
 Keyboards, so it might be the reason to change charachters.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) ummmm hummmm. Naturally the 100 told Tandy there was a
  European and Latin American market that could make good use of the additional
  character set. So t'was included in 102 design plans. Methinks.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, was I correct about why your program bombed the first
  time? Did you try to send left arrow and right arrow instead of <<<<< and
  >>>> ???
(JOHN SHADEL) Yes, that was the problem.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Keep in mind that for effects such as you attempted it is just
  fine to use STRING$(4,154) for instance. That would be four right arrows.


(Keith C) Yes, Have a question: I have a 1000& a 100 and want to get by without
 buying a modem for the 1000. how do you hook up the two of them to use the
 100 internal modem?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sorry Keith, it can't be done. The RS-232 and the modem use
  the same circuitry so that you can't use them both at once; folks have been
  trying that for three years plus; t'ain't possible.
  You'll have to get a modem, but DO NOT get the 300 baud Tandy internal card!!
(Keith C) One last question: How about other models 102, 200 et al,
 still trying to figure a way to use internal modem guess it's time to break
 down and buy one. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Your conclusion is correct, and be sure you get a Hayes
  compatible!


(JOHN SHADEL) I just remembered seeing somewhere some talk about a relative
 file access system for use with the TDD. Has anyone heard any more about that?
(Sysop Tony) According to the info I have, which includes a copy of the Brother
 programming manual for the disk drive, the internal ROM on the Brother/Tandy
 drive is programmed for only two types of access.  Sequential, and by sector.
 Therefore, the only alternative to sequential access would be at the sector
 level.  Sectors are 256 bytes each. Therefore, any "random access" program
 developed, and one is being developed, will access records of 256 bytes each.
 In other words, an entire sector. What you store in that sector, or how you
 divide it up will be your business.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmmm, mailing address with only 256 bytes? Can do I guess.
(JOHN SHADEL) OK. I wonder if a RAM program could be used, and the resultant
 files then transferred to the TDD??
(Sysop Tony) Of course, but you can do that now, with sequential access and
 either of the three commercial "Dos's" available. The key to handling LARGE
 data bases, though is some sort of random access, which the TDD doesn't, and
 really isn't gonna ever support.
(Denny) The problem will always be the lack of ability to open more than one
 file at a time that makes disk based files limited to ram size.
(JOHN SHADEL) Yes.. I can see the limitations. Looks like it's Chipmunk time!
(Sysop Tony) (Better choice!)


(Jon O) Just wanted to let you know that Soundsight sent me a new EPROM for the
 bubble operation so all the conflicts I had are now gone.
(Sysop Tony) What does it do, Jon?
(Jon O) It's an enhanced version of the old operating (tape based version).
 It's added quite a few features that the old version didn't have; can rename
 files in the bubble, can initialize the hooks for I/O etc from the Bubble,
 and also when you load a file from the bubble to RAM the software takes you
 back to the Bubble menu rather than leaving you in BASIC. It's quite
 interesting and I'm having a good time with it. Only problem now is that A ROM
 bank is necessay.
(Sysop Tony) Jon, the Soundsight Bubble Memory device has been on the market a
 couple of years now; do you thing they will EVER come down in price so the
 average person can afford one? Four times the price of the computer is a bit
 much. Also, you are still the only one I know who has one.
(Jon O) I can't say if the price will ever come down. In two years it hasn't
 changed but then sombody must be buying them. Soundsight is still in business.
(Eiji) Does it work with M100 only, or does it work for T200, 102, also?
(Denny) It's especially expensive in light of PG Design's announcement
 of 224k for about $500 
(Sysop Tony) Where was that "announcement" Denny?
(Denny) On the message board by none other than Phil; shipping will start next
 week. 6 banks of 32K, no waiting.
(Sysop Tony) OK.... I'm looking for something a little firmer than that as an
  "announcement".  But OK.
(Jon O) the PG is 6 banks but the bubble is one solid unit of memory.
 so there is a diference there... just a comment.
(Sysop Tony) At least Soundsight seems to have an OS that addresses a larger
 portion of RAM space.  Something we are trying to get PG Designs to do for the
 Tandy 200.
(Denny) Phil said that Peter is still working on the contiguous ram OS, but
 when it's available is another question.
(Sysop Tony) The difficulty I have with that is that PG Design has never really
 made any effort to participate here nor to support their products here and to
 the best of my knowledge, has not announced these "new" products except to
 Davey Utter, and Phil Wheeler. I don't think it behooves us to ballyhoo "new"
 products that may still be in the beta-test stage or not yet deliverable.
 The promise, "shipping next week" is as good as the contract it's written
 in and is one of the reasons third-party suppliers have such a bad rap
 reputation in the marketplace.  Any more comment?
(Denny) well, Phil's got one on order, so will see when he tells us about
 getting it.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jon, I was "wondering" if you and Stevie Wonder were enuff to
  keep SoundSight in business??
(Jon O) I can "see" your humor in that statement.
(Sysop Tony) (tee hee)
(Jon O) but Soundsight is going strong so there must be others.  An oil company
 or two.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just sighting on what it has sounded like to me!!


(Marty T) I've been on vacation so maybe I missed the talk...
 Has anybody handled an M-102? are the peeks and pokes the same? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes Marty the PEEK, POKE, CALL, and such all seem to be
  perfectly compatible. See 102.INF in the DL 6 database, but also 102.DIF in
  the DL 4 database has some differences that should not affect many, if any,
  programs. Until I learn differently, I'm stating that the 102 is 100%
  compatible with 100's software, but not hardware.
(Denny) I was just looking at 102.DIF and at the reset location there is a
 different address, when you hit RESET it now goes to a different place.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) would that affect SOFTWARE or HARDWARE?? Only use that I know
  of for RESET, other than RESET, is with theChipmunk.
(Denny) That is a general service routine used by various internal programs.
 I think the new Telcom feature is routed there.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, perhaps should not make any difference then.  Note that
  X-TEL.CO has been proven compatible with the Model 102. By me anyway.


(Gary D.) Has anybody used LCDraw from Lonestar Software?
(Sysop Tony) Nobody's mentioned it on the board. I've been noticing their
 ads. It's sort of like our program in DL3, CANVAS.
 But probably much more sofisticated.
(Gary D.) Yes, I have it and it's kinda nifty makes the 100 into a small "MAC"
 and I'll try to write somethin' up 'bout it and get it to you.
(Sysop Tony) Good, Good. We could use a few good review files in DL6.
(Gary D.) O.K., as time permits I'll get something together for y'all.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Correct "a few" to " a lot"
(Gary D.) Another thing, in addition to having the program on cassette the
 author also provides it on disk, as long as you have the Acroatix DOS.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If'n his business picks up, maybe he'll offer it for other
  disks too.
(Sysop Tony) That's interesting. Maybe a few more suppliers will start
 releasing on disk. But we call gotta face the fact that the Model 100 is now a
 dead machine. It's discontinued, and no longer available. (grin)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks that being discontinued does not equal "dead machine"
(Gary D.) Fer sure!!!!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) there is still software being sold and developed for the
  Model I and Model III to say nothing of the Model 4.
(RUSH CALEY) I surely agree, there is lots of new m100 stuff and even for the
 D/VI. I'm keeping my 100's!
(Sysop Tony) Sure, we all are keeping our M100's. And sure, new stuff is being
 developed but there are no new machines, so those who don't have M100's
 now will have to settle for an M102. or something else. The M100 user base
 cannot grow any further. And while the existing base can be supported, there
 may be only so many buyers of RAM expansions, and disk drives, etc.
 There was even a rumor that the Chipmunk may be discontinued.
 (Disaster that THAT would be!!!) So unless someone NEW picks up a USED
 M100, the user group has reached it's zenith.  The machine is dead, but not
 the users or the suppliers.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is why the Model 102 compatibility is so vitally
  important.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Conference is over time and therefore declared at an end.
  Thanks all, and stay around for yak-yak as long as desired. We never close.
