(Sysop Tony) Tap tap tap.... Meeting called to order.

(larry l) Are there any files on parameters for using the tape functions with
 just a regular audio recorder?
(Sysop Tony) No, no parameters are needed. You just have to set the recorder so
 that it works. All of them, won't. (unfortunately).
(larry l) i mean do you need a square wave instead of a sine wave(which is what
 most audio recorders use) 
(Sysop Tony) No. The only recorder that is capable of square waves is the
 recorder for the Commodores, anyway. It's a matter of setting the correct
 level. You need about 2.5 volts out of the recorder and an auxilliary input,
 or an adapter to reduce the computer output to go into the microphone level
 input.
(larry l) so most audio recorders should work?
(Sysop Tony) Yes, most of them should work in theory, anyway....
(RICH L) there is a file on the Micro Recorders that has an adaptor that works
 for other recorders also....don't have the name handy though.
(Sysop Tony) Actually There are about three files (maybe four) in DL5 that deal
 with recording on micro cassettes; some of the information is applicable to
 using regular cassette recorders.
(Mel) Cheapest way to handle the recorder overload is a tiny .001 mmfd cap in
 series with the mike lead. it will fit inside the connector of the cassette
 wiring...


(Curtis G) Has anyone come up with a way to use both the DVI & Chip
 at the same time ...
(Sysop Tony) Not that I'm aware of... both DOS's try to use the same RAM space.


(Gary Reuter) Hello - I've been having problems with control codes and
 XMODEM.312, can you help?
(Sysop Tony) Have you left a message on the message board asking for help?
 Is anyone here who uses Xmodem?
(Gary Reuter) Yep, did that last night but nothing yet.
(John R) Gary, since XMODEM.312 is written in BASIC any control codes that you
 send while on-line are first intercepted there. Consequently, you can't send
 ^C from the keyboard. Any text file that you send will go OK, whether it has
 control characters or not. 
(tom A.) I have been using XMODEM a little, It seem like it has lots of good
 features but why cant it send non-ascii file.
(Gary Reuter) Yeah but I can't download prog files through DataPac -- I need
 XMODEM and I...q 
(larry l) gary..check out xmd100.hex it runs in m/l adn has good features..
 i haven't used it yet but you could give it a shot.
(Gary Reuter) I have been using XMD100.HEX but I can't upload with it.
 I'ts great apatr that.
(Sysop Tony) You have a special condition. Coming in from Canada via a
 connecting link you will always have some problems. I'd advise you to try to
 use plain vanilla TELCOM downloads rather than trying to get something
 running that you have obvious difficulties with.  
(Gary Reuter) XMDHEX.100 works fine for downloading, here and locally, but I
 can't get it to upload at all.  Howver XMDEM.312 uploads fine locally but not
 here because of the Control character problems.  Does anyone else from Can.
 have the same problems?
(Sysop Tony) Since it is machine language you will probably have to obtain help
 from the author. very few folks know ML programming. No one else has mentioned
 such problems.
(Gary Reuter) I did leave him a message but according to Dave, he doesn't come
 around here much.
(Sysop Tony) Well, I can't do much about that. And no one here knows how to
 deal with your problem. Anything else?
(Gary Reuter) No, not anymore, just let him know if you here from him that I
 have questions.


(Rich W.) I have just received an IBM PC and I'm anxious to hook up with
 m100 does anyone out there have experience with disk+, Telecommuter, etc. for
 advice?
(Sysop Tony) There are two or three files in DL1 for you. Try a scan on the
 keyword IBM. Also see the review of Disk + in DL6.
(ROBI) I do like DISK+, I use it on my IBM, Model I, and Coco.  I also use it
 whenever i want to xfer between systems.
(RICH L) The Feb issue of Port 100/200 has a GREAT Story about using the PC
 with the 100...Read it forst, you may not want to use DISK+
(Rich W.) That's why I asked. If (accord to Feb 100) I can xfer w/ a few dos
 com, Why spend $200? Whats the gain with these programs?
(larry l) the article left out apple//e &//c
(John R) The question of what programs you need always depends on who you are
 and what you intend to do with them. Personally, I use the comsh program,
 available on the Programmers' SIG, and either TELCOM or XMODEM.312 on the
 Model 100 for data transfers. DISK+ and TELECOMMUTER offer more features and
 are easier to use.
 Attempting to use just the MS-DOS commands to transfer data has lots of
 problems associated with it if you don't understand what is going on.
(Sysop Tony) Rich, I've read comments on the board to the effect that FLTIBM
 and PCXFER from DL1 are very servicable.
(Rich W.) Thanks. I will download those ( & try the MITE that came w/ PC)


(Reid P) Tony--I got BYTFYTER and RENUMBER excellent! Thanks.
(Rich W.) Reid P- where did you find BYTEFYTER and RENUMBER? are they in DL?
(Sysop Tony) They're commercial programs we discussed them a couple weeks ago.
 available from Custom Software, whose address is in the file VENDOR.???
 in DL6.

(RICH L) Are flowers in order for Joel Dinda?... the one that didn't like
 DSKTRM and was going to write a super program like it.
(Sysop Tony) Well I don't recall anything more about that. However, he was also
 interested in a TDD spelling checker which is coming online this week assuming
 the user has POWR-DISK or TS-DOS software.
(RICH L) ok....maybe he's tied up on that. I have updated DSKTRM with error
 trapping and was holding up uploading, waiting on Joel.
(Sysop Tony) You don't have to wait. ga and upload it noting it's a modified
 version of existing programs. if he continues to pursue the project, he'll
 simply have another modified version anyway.
(DAVID E) I FORGOT WHERE YOU SAID DSKTRM WAS LAST WEEK WHERE IS IT?
(Sysop Tony) .... DL1.
(Rich W.) For us eavesroppers-what is DSKTRM?
(Sysop Tony) You had to ask that, didn't you. It's a method of hooking up an
 external modem with a computer and the TDD to be able to simulate downloading
 to disk on the TDD which isn't possible with the Tandy computers. It's also a
 controlling program.

(:Lan Y:) I just received my Ultim.Rom II. It is a bodacious piece of work.
 On the box it notes that the TDD initial load program is buried on the chip
 but the docs don't say how to get to it. Does anyone know???
(Sysop Tony) Uh huh... I saw one yesterday. If it's there, in order to make it
 work it's gotta be on the menu.
(:Lan Y:) I thought...there I go again thinking... perhaps it was on an
 unmarked function key under the TSDOS stub they built in.
(Sysop Tony) Well apparently TS-DOS isn't TS-DOS. when you try to use it, you
 get an error message to the effect that TS-DOS isn't loaded. I don't know
 exactly what that means except TS-DOS is available separately for
 about $60 or $70.
(:Lan Y:) True enough but there are some functions built in you can "preview"
 (read) a doc off the TDD and print from TDD without the full implementation.
(doug m.) Just the same comment that you made. TS-Dos is available seperately,
and unless you have it, then The TS-DOS access would seemingly not do anything.
(Sysop Tony) we may have to wait a little longer for additional clarification
 on that whole thing.
(:Lan Y:) Just an interim...IF you have the T-200 version, you get the WHOLE
 of TS-DOS on the chip. If you are on a M-100 the chip contains that part of
 TS-DOS which lets T-WORD talk to TDD and print/read/and chain merge.
 Personally, I would have swapped T-Base for the full TS-DOS.
(Sysop Tony) I think they couldn't put T-View 80 on the 200 version,
 so swapped it for the TDD DOS.


(Sysop Tony) Let's discuss the new spelling checker programs just merged last
 night. Dave Willman wrote them and is here to discuss them.
 Dave, I see the whole program approach can be used also for the TDD with the
 POWR-DISK or TS-DOS software and a smaller version of the dictionary... maybe
 12-15,000 words.  I was impressed by the actual running of the programs.
(DaveW.) Well as some of you may already have heard I've been spending time
 trying to get Tony's spelling check program to run much faster and the results
 of my labors are now on the Sig in DL5 in the form of two new files. The main
 one of which is called DICT.CHP which contains all the disk file management
 programs in Basic including a new version of the spelling checker program;
 but also the real work-horse and time saver is...
(Sysop Tony) I'll tell you, the running times are VERY impressive! 
(DaveW.) the M/L program loaded by DCPREP.LDR also in DL5.
 Tony can tell you the time savings with the new approach.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, the old programs did a 12 K file in about 2 hours the new
 programs do it in about 20 minutes that's significant!  There are several cute
 methods used to speed it up. And maybe one more that can be added later.
 We'll see. I'm sure it's a major advance.  Good work, Dave.
(DaveW.) I wan't to stress there are some pitfalls to the programs so PLEASE
 read the documents carefully. The docs for DICT.CHP are contained within the
 file. The docs for DCPREP.LDR are in DCPREP.DOC.
 Tony, how do you like the loader? 
(Sysop Tony) Yes, saving the file to be checked before checking is MANDATORY!!!
 The loader works fine except that it may be confusing for non-hacker types.
 Some folks don't know himem from cold-start commands.
(:Lan Y:) Was I correct in thinking the suffix ".CHP" was for CHiPmunk??
 How do TDD users get in??
(Sysop Tony) Yes, CHP stands for Chipmunk... that's where the project started
 but as with most disk oriented software, small command changes allow it to
 be used with all the available drives.  I'll be testing this week and make
 sure we have a TDD version of the program available if necessary but the
 dictionary will have to be constructed by each individual, from the existing
 files in DL5, which will need some editing, in order to fit the TDD disk.
(:Lan Y:) If it uses Powr-Disk or TS-DOS, I hope the M/L conflicts don't bomb
 us out.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, it will need POWR-DISK or TS-DOS to access the disk.
 The machine language program will not conflict, since it is relocatable and
 does not access the disk directly.
  Dave... I'd have thought that an automatic load under Himem would have been
 easier, with a prompt asking if it was OK to go ahead.
(DaveW.) Good thought, was thinking about defaulting the address there
 but I like your thought better. I'll work on it.
(Sysop Tony) OK... looking really good!  I'm real happy we could get it online.


(Sysop Tony) Jimmy, I can't speak officially for the Tandy Corporation but it
 seems the ATSO program is more useful for business oriented customers.
 This SIG has been referred to as the "Personal Computer ATSO".
(JIMMY D) But with the number of people who own these computers for business
 use it would seem that the ATSO would be supportive of this system.
(Sysop Tony) I can't argue that what's been your experience?  
(JIMMY D) I have had very little helpful experience with the ATSO as far as
 customer 


(Jay M.) Where can I find documentation on a) ROM calls and other machine
 technical stuff for ML programming and b) TDD command/response protocols?
(Sysop Tony) A) Nothing is fully documented and no official support is
 available, you gotta find them on your own via disassembly or keeping your
 ears open. I just started a project, documenting as much as I could find in
 the files CALLS.MNU & CALLS.ROM in DL4.
 B) NO ONE is talking about the TDD command structure because it's HOT,
 and has terrific commercial possibilities....
(JIMMY D) Tony, TANDY has a booklet of ROM calls available for the M100.
(Sysop Tony) Really?  I've seen no such book are you perhaps referring to the
 Technical Manual?
(JIMMY D) I cannot remember the title of the document, but I do not believe
 that it is the Technical Manual. If you will EMAIL address, I will send you a
 complimentary copy of the documentation.
(Sysop Tony) Good, I'd appreciate having it trying to build a file of valid
 CALL addressed.
(John R) The Tandy document mentioned was a few pages listing the documented
 CALL's that later was incorporated into the Tech Manual.
 "Hidden Powers ..." is the best book on the subject that I have seen.
(Sysop Tony) Well, the Tech Manual is like a dictionary of only the three
 letter words. Very short on useful info.
(DaveW.) Jay, another GOOD source besides "Hidden Powers" is a back issue
 of Byte it's the May '84 issue if you can still get it.
(Jay M.) "Hidden Powers"?
(Sysop Tony) One book of five. Very good for peeks, pokes, calls, and misc info
 you don't get in the instruction manual.
 It's listed in the file BOOKS.001 in DL6.

("jesse") Just looking for a scn prt prg for a C.Itoh prt??? dat's the 8510A.
(Sysop Tony) For the 100 or 200?  
("jesse") 100.
(Sysop Tony) OK, lesseee. there are a couple of screen print programs in the
 database either DL0 or DL4 but such are very printer specific.
("jesse") If its not new, it's not there.
(Sysop Tony) The problem is that Screen dump programs have to be keyed to the
 printer they will be used on because the computers work with pixel graphics,
 they aren't directly "dumpable".... your best bet is to contact Jim Irwin
 whose company, Portable BASICs will write a custom program for you.
 he may be able to modify an existing program if you can supply your codes.
 his commercial programs sell for about $15-$20...  Need his phone number?
("jesse") Ya, thad be great!
(Sysop Tony) He advertises in Portable 100 magazine.
 phone number is (616) 343-9315. he's in Michigan.


(Stuart R) Nice LAUGH meeting yesterday,
 but where should I put my Blackjack review ?
(Sysop Tony) It should go in DL6; use the extension .REV to indicate it's a
 review.... perhaps BLKJK.REV???
(Stuart R) Thanks, I'll write it today...
(Sysop Tony) thanks; know others will appreciate your insights on the product.


(Len E.) To transfer from a Model 100 to Mac, with an ImageWriter II cord:
 how do you do it?
(Sysop Tony) from what I've heard, the best software for the Mac end is
 Red Ryder. See the file CABLE.MAC in DL1 and MAC100.TXT.
 try keywords MAC in the form S/KEY:MAC


(DaveW.) Tony, should I announce the new arrivals on the message board to all
 or will you do it for me? 
(Sysop Tony) Well... actually, you should have sent a message to Dave when you
 uploaded them just to let him know what the files were all about. Of course,
 since that was an ongoing project he knew immediately. But if you left a note
 for him, anyone interested could have read it and that's really all the notice
 required. One of the ideas of sending Dave a message is so others will know
 it's coming up.

(Jon O) I was just on the sig with telcom.co and evidently filled up the
 disk. m100 went blank, went off line and now I am unable to reload CDOS.
 any theories on what has happened?
(Sysop Tony) Probably CDOS bombed when the disk pointers exceeded the expected
 limits. Go into BASIC and do LFILES OFF, then CALL0 to reload CDOS.
(Jon O) I did do several Cold starts but no luck, will try the lfiles off.
(Sysop Tony) Take a peek at the -4 address and make sure it's 0 before
 attempting to load CDOS. Command in BASIC is PRINT PEEK(-4)
 If it isn't 0 then POKE-4,0 to clear CDOS.


(Avery Russell) I have a model 100 which after being purchased last year, has been in the drawer. I would like to print on my IBM PC printers
 Do you have a program that converts the model 100 print file?
(Sysop Tony) No conversion is necessary just the proper cable, and plug it into
 your printer. the Model 100 file is pure ASCII and sending it to the printer
 is a snap.
(PaulS) Avery, what IBM printer are you using?
(Avery Russell) I have an Epson/IBM dot matrix and a Smith Carona; also a
 brother
(PaulS) I don't know about the SC or the brother, But with the Epson, you will
 need to set for auto line feed...
(Avery Russell) If I reset the epson it wont work for the IBM.
(PaulS) There's a switch inside, see the  Epson manual..
(Sysop Tony) Well, that's one of the problems involved in trying to use one
 printer with two computers.
 No, Avery, don't buy another printer that's not your problem. First you have
 to get the proper cable then plug it into the Model 100. Then if you need a
 line feed after CR download the program LFUTL.PW1 from DL4 and run it.
 it modifies the operating system to send the line feed.


(Sysop Tony) Conference ended, but stick around and talk...
 Thanks all for coming... see you later.
