The subject index of this new product provides an additional benefit.  This
index allows you to search through the files by the subject of your choice.

to your subject of interest.  Each file entry in the guide will contain the
file name, description of the file, the individual who uploaded the program,
date uploaded, storage size and where the program is located by forum and data
library.

libraries, looking for that specific utility or application program.  Get right
to the heart of your interests, these guides will take you where you want to go
fast.
