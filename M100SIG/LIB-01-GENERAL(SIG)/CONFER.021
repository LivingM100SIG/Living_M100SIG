(larry l) maybe you could reccommend that when people upload files that they
 include a BEL command at the end of the file. that way we can leave the comp
 to download and be informed when its done.
(Sysop Tony) BEL, as well as most other control characters are stripped from
 the text and are reserved characters that are sent by the system.
 You might try setting your prompt character to ^G in the OP section,...
(rowlfe) concur. maybe a dl prompt function? like in the sig, a custom prompt
 character.
(Sysop Tony) You can set ^G as the prompt character in the OP section. 
(larry l) just a thought... 
(rowlfe) on the prompt thing ....
 setting by using OP only affects the function prompt, not the DL's. The DL's
 act exactly like the public access area, and I don't think sig functions carry
 over there. My char is set using OP to ^G already on here, and it goes away in
 the DL's. 
(Sysop Tony) OK... I guess that's that. The ACCESS Software is actually a
 different program that you are transferred to when you go to the DL's.  I'll
 pass on the suggestion to the higher ups, but changes take forever to
 implement, IF they think they're a good idea.

(larry l) just an addition to last weeks conf on file transfer. I have been
 doing some reading on my Super Serial card for my Apple// and I have found
 that by redefining the input and output ports you can in theory use the m100
 or any comp to control the apple...and thus transfer files and programs...i
 havent tried this yet but i see no reason why it wont work.
(Sysop Tony) Larry, that raises an interesting point. The question comes up now
 and then as to whether the Model 100 can be uses as a remote keyboard for
 another computer.  You've apparently solved that question for the Apple, as
 Rowlfe and I have solved it for the NorthStar computers....
 Maybe a file on that subject would be a good idea.
(rowlfe) [think I mentioned doing that in my rs232 file.]
(larry l) I am unfamiliar with comps other than apple and m100 but the apple
 input and output can be ..  i and o is programmable and m100 can read and
 write a file at will. is this peculiar to these comps?
(rowlfe) larry, do you mean that using the super serial card, which I guess
 gives the apple some additional I/O ports you define the ports such that the
 m100 can be used as an additional device, or instead of the regular
 keyboard/display?
(larry l) the apple is set up such that the slots can be programmed as input
 devices(inplace of the keyboard) or output ports(such as the crt screen) at
 will(within programs etc> and thus the m100 should be able to take the place
 of both the keybd and screen.
(rowlfe) in essence, you are doing the same as me then, I guess, using the....
 as a psuedo "terminal" of sorts. right?
(larry l) the file capture on both ends is a bit kludgey but i think it will
 work. i plan to try it this week and will report on it if anyone is
 interested.
(Sysop Tony) I like the idea of being able to use the M100 as an alternate
 keyboard with it's in-built ability to capture data.

(larry l) this method shoud work with the modem too..the important thing is to
 have frimware on the apple card ot do the file handling and comm..
 also..is this method common to comps with slots(such as IBM)?
(Sysop Tony) Whoops!  right there you lost it. If you're referring to using the
 M100's modem at the same time as the RS-232 port. Can't be done due to a
 single purpose chip.
(larry l) no..no
(Sysop Tony) The method is common to any computer than has the ability to
 donfigure it's I/O ports. Let's see what John has to say.
(John R) With MS-DOS machines it is possible to reconfigure the system input
 and output devices using the STTY command. One uses the logical device names
 such as COM: rather than I/O addresses. Some problems are:
 1. You lose the ability to use the function keys and other special-purpose
    keys, since they do not have standard ASCII codes,
 2. If you only have one serial port, you can't, of course, use the 100 as a
    keyboard while communicating with a modem, and
 3. You usually run into problems if there is an I/O error, especially if
    connected through a MODEM.
(Sysop Tony) Larry, any more on that?  Or can I pontificate some more.?
 With the NorthStar, we can change the I/O in the DOS to activate various
 I/O ports as the default, or console ports... so when the M100 is plugged
 in and the I/O change made in the DOS, the computer thinks the M100 is just
 another terminal.  (or THE terminal). Maybe we should do a file specifically
 on the topic of using the M100 as a remote keyboard. Rowlfe's info is buried
 in a file whose name would not lead you to that application.
(rowlfe) true the info is buried but the bigger topic which i added the file on
 was using the rs232 link. I only used the N* as an example. maybe a separate
 file would be appropriate.  on using the m100 as a terminal, you are limited
 to the same type of speed restrictions as the modem sort of, because of the
 display.
(Sysop Tony) Only if you use the M100's display I don't relay on that portion,
 just the keyboard.  And of course, if I upload a file the computer thinks it
 is getting direct keyboard input.
(larry l) i plan to use this method as a faster way to store files on my apple
 ( i dont have a disk drive for my m100) and as a way to dump files for use at
 the start of the day and to dump them at the end.
(Sysop Tony) the way I used it was to write a program for the NorthStar while
 at work, and when I uploaded it the Northstar thought it was keyboard input,
 as 9600 baud.  The same idea could be used to transfer a file to disk or
 whatever.
(rowlfe) [which is how I do it.]
(Sysop Tony) First, configure the computer for the second keyboard input, then
 open a text file, then upload from the M100 as second keyboard, then close the
 file, and you've got it.
(rowlfe) on the N* a simple fix of replacing a RET with a NOP gets you a dual
 input/output scheme which allows either the normal terminal or the alternate
 terminal to make input with output going to both. that way, disk access and
 everything is fair game.
(larry l) when downloading files i heard the secrren..
     also...is there a recommended speed for comp to comp transfer?
(Sysop Tony) No, you can use any convenient speed, however if you use 9600 or
 19,200 baud with the Model 100, you are likely to run into the DATE$ bug,
 which is well documented and causes your calendar to suddenly go screwy.
(rowlfe) [mine does all the time!! doing it at 19.2k]

(GRAY) Has anyone received the January or February issues of Portable 100/200?
(Sysop Tony) No, the January issue is late, and the Feb issue isn't due out
 until the last week of the month.

(Maddi) Speaking of the notorious DATE$ bug has anyone yet, with normal use,
 had it happen yet this year? I have not.
(Sysop Tony) Oh, yes. Happens regularly without taking some precautions.
(larry l) what bug?
(Sysop Tony) For the record (transcript)  the file DATEBG.FIX in DL4,
 coauthored by larry gensch and myself discusses in detail what causes the bug,
 and suggests several ways to get around it.
 (Larry, the calendar date changing erratically).
(Maddi) Well, I hope my luck holds out. Never happened to me very often.

(Sysop Tony) The difference in screen speed and transmission speed is
 discussed in the file 1200BD.PGM in DL1.
(larry l) ok.  is ther a recommended transfer speed ofr comp to comp.
(Sysop Tony) Use any you like, but avoid 9600 and 19,200 unless you like
 resetting your calendar often because of the DATE$ bug. However, I may have
 missed the thrust of your question since there is an LCD speed limitation that
 figures in here, too. Any time you can see data going in or out of the
 Model 100 on the screen, the transfer limit it about 600 buad due to the
 refresh rate of the LCD drivers.  That's what's detailed in the file
 1200BD.PGM in DL1. You can communicate at 4800, 9600, or 19,200
 but the actual transfer rate will be about 600 baud.
(rowlfe) [300 is slow and sure and works with display]

(rowlfe) if you use the telcom program, you are limited, but if you do straight
 xfers like <save "com:98n1e"> then it all goes as planned since the LCD is not
 involved. we did that at the last 2 l.a.u.g.h. meetings. worked FINE.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, you are correct. You can transfer in and out of the Model 100
 and Tandy 200 at true speed. If you do it direct from the TEXT mode, or from
 BASIC, using the Load from or Save to commands. Just gotta remember to go into
 TELCOM when you're done, and reset your COM status to M7I1e.
(larry l) are you saying that if using telcom you cannot simply load or dump
 file at speeds higher than 600 baud...and if so i must use save load to use
 high speed?
(Sysop Tony) Well, not quite but close. in TELCOM, you can "communicate" at
 whatever speed you like but file transfers will be limited to about 600 baud.
 If you Load or Save direct from the TEXT editor mode, the transfer is not
 displayed on the screen, so you get the true transfer speed.
(rowlfe) [only if xon/xoff honored else lost data]
(John R) You also need to know if the other computer is capable of handling the
 XON/XOFF protocol. While I am able to transfer FROM my 2000 to my 100 at 9600
 BAUD (the fastest supported under MS-DOS). I can't capture to disk when
 transferring TO my 2000 at faster than 1200 due to a bug in Tandy's BIOS
 (grumble, grumble) which does not support the protocol in that direction.
(Sysop Tony) Well, of course, now we've opened a new can of worms. There are,
 or course machine limitations and of course the communication parameters must
 agree and the phase of the moon has to be just right, but in general, you can
 do it, within the limitations set by each machine.
(rowlfe) John R, do you have an XMODEM program? or one that uses the
 Christianson protocol? If so use that for the batch xfer. I use MDM712 on the
 Northstar, and MDM312 from here on the m100 and all transfers go off without a
 hitch. Using just a "capture" buffer results in lost data when the disk starts
 up since your software seems not to send the xoff. right? is this what
 happens?

(JACK ROBB) DOES ANY ONE KNOW IF THE MOD100 CAN USE AN EXTERNAL MODEM ?
(Sysop Tony) Yes, Jack you can use an external modem with the Model 100, but
 can't communicate at greater than 600 baud.
(JACK ROBB) HOW DO  I ACCESS THE MODEM PORT ON BACK FROM TELECOM?
(Sysop Tony) You communicate through the TELCOM program with a status setting
 of whatever is needed but you didn't answer my question...
 Why would you want to do that when the Model 100 already has a builtin modem?
(JACK ROBB) THE INTERNAL MODEM WONT SEND A CARRIER
(Sysop Tony) Why doesn't the internal modem work?
(JACK ROBB) IT IS ONE OF  THE ONES WITH A BAD CHIP IN IT YES, IT NEEDS A CHIP
 REPLACED. TANDY USED TO FIX THEM BUT THIS IS A USED ONE AND I CANT GET THEM TO
 FIX IT WITHOUT $$$$ 
(Sysop Tony) Well, then, you can use an external modem, (but it won't dial or
 send auto logon sequences), by simply plugging it into the RS-232 port, and
 setting your status to 37I1E.  Then your I/O is directed to the RS-232
 port instead of the internal modem.

(John R) Rowlfe, to answer your second q first yes, the buffer in the 2000
 overflows while the disk write is in progress and the @$%# BIOS  doesn't send
 an XOFF. About XMODEM, yes, I have XMODEM.312 and the corresponding capability
 on my 2000, but I don't always have it in RAM on the 100, it is usually easier
 just to plug in and do the SAVE at 1200, and I haven't figured out how to get
 XMODEM.312 to work with a direct connection anyway!
(rowlfe) seems to me mdm312 can access the rs232 port if you tell it it has
 to use an external modem. find the line with the COM:57i1e in it and change it
 to whatever stat you want to use. I can't remember exactly where it is in the
 program, but I did it a long time ago and promtly ignored it after that. also,
 can you change the size of your capture buffer? the N* I use defaults to 16k,
 but I can set it up or down as I see fit. maybe a bigger buffer can get you
 around the bug in the software which you might not be able to fix.
(Sysop Tony) John, are you saying the 2000 does not support Xon/Xoff?
(John R) Well, there is a BUG in many MS-DOS systems which SHOULD support
 XON/XOFF but don't. I have a patch from the TRS80 Pro SIG which fixes the
 problem while sending from the 2000, but I don't know of a fix for the other
 direction.

(MARK SAILER) JOHN, I USE A MS-DOS MACHINE AT WORK. I USE 9600 BD FOR TRANSFERS
 TO AND FROM OUR COMPUTERS. WHAT PROG. ARE YOU USING?
(John R) I am using the comsh program on a Tandy 2000. The bug, as I understand
 it, is in the BIOS, which is specific to each machine. I'm glad it is fixed
 on yours. Are you transferring directly to and from diskette on your machine?
(MARK SAILER) YES, THE FILE SIZE IS GENENERALLY ABOUT 196K. THE PROG. THAT WE
 USE IS A COMMERCIAL PROG.CALLED MITE AND TERM ORIGANNNALY DESIGNED FOR CPM
 MACHINES. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO PROBLEMS I HAVE NOT HAD A REAL PROB. EVEN WITH
 THE 100.

(Fred S.) I have a quicky about the 200. Does the RS232 port allow for normal
 comm with the telcom program, or do you lose something??? i want to use my
 external 1200 baud both at work, and at home.
(Sysop Tony) The Tandy 200 is very good for 1200 baud communication but it
 suffers the same line feed problem as the Model 100. You have to do a poke
 into memory or you get none when a file is sent. Suggest you get the program
 LFEED.200 from DL4 to solve that problem. then get the file 1200BD.PGM from
 DL1 for a discussion of 1200 baud use and a driver program for an external
 modem.
(Fred S.) What about nul modem transfers, say to dedicated wp machines
(Sysop Tony) You need a null modem... The exact configuration depends on what
 the OTHER computer needs.  The 200 is very friendly, but needs handshaking.
 see the file NULL.MDM in DL5 for one recommendation.
(rowlfe) [generic nullmodem can be found in RS232.RG1]

(Paul S) For Mod 100, does anybody know if you can put additional RAM in the
 spare ROM socket??
(Sysop Tony) No, that can't be done, the address lines are different. But RAM
 expansions are available that plug into the system bus.

(John R) The Model 100 was the first and only portable computer used on the
 space shuttle.
 May I propose that we have a minute of silence here in honor of our
 astronauts?














(MARK SAILER) TONY, IS THERE A SOURCE FOR THE ROM SOURCE CODE AND POKES FOR 
 THE 100.
(Sysop Tony) No, not an official source. Prints to several hundred pages.
 several folks have done their own, however, with a disassembler.
(rowlfe) mine printed out at 254 pages at 80 lines per page. also the M100 rom
 uses a unique set of something or other for one of the RST. next byte after
 RST 7, I think as a data byte, which is used as an offset into a lookup table.
 best bet is to grab the 100ROM files and then disassemble whatever parts
 interest you, rather than do the whole thing.
(John R) Rowlfe, you are correct about the RST 7. The calls are documented in
 "Hidden Powers."
(Sysop Tony) Mark, there are 8 files in DL4 that might interest you, and to
 which Rowlfe referred. 100RAM.RDC is the first and the rest are 100ROM.RC0 to
 100ROM.RC6

(MARK SAILER) IS THERE A POKE THAT WILL ALLOW THE INTERNAL MODEM TO STAY ON
 LINE EVEN WHEN YOU EXIT TELECOM?
(Sysop Tony) Not from TELCOM itself. Exiting does a warm reset, but if you use
 a BASIC terminal emulator, you can do it and some of the super enhancement
 programs do that such as TELPRO from Micro Demon, and possibly SUPERA.
 However, not familiar with the actual workings of those programs.

1:58:08 PM EST Sunday, February 2, 1986

(Sysop Tony) Well then, I officially close this conference.
 Feel free to stick around and gab all you like.
