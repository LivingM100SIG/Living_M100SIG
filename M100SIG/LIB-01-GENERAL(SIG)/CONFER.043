(larry l) i saw something about 60 column software on the whats new list.
 what is it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) larry, you mean the VIEW ?
(larry l) yes 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup, it provides the 60 columns and 10 lines to the Model 100
  screen that many folks have appreciated. Didn't test it (crossed my fingas)
  but folks like it fine - with the usual M/L warnings.
(larry l) I am amazed and grateful for the amount of freeware available on
 m100 sig.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well larry, take a whack at the VIEW, but don't try to use it
  with other M/L programs loaded at the same time unless you're VERY sure of
  addresses etc.

(larry l) i have downloaded flipm/l and i think i will start using it,
 but i need help finding the addresses to input in the prog.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) that is a VERY good question that hasn't been covered here
  lately. For ANY M/L program (showing as .CO on Menu) it is a few simple steps
  to get the needed addresses.
  1) Go into BASIC ...
  2) Use the direct command LOADM "VIEW" or whatever the .CO filename is ...
  3) you will receive back three numbers preceded with "Start address" et alia
  4) record those numbers for entry in DATA lines of FLIPML if that is what you
  are using ...
  5) If desired, use command CLEAR 256, nnnnnn where nnnnnn = the "Start
  address" reported ....
  6) return to Menu and you can run your M/L (or .CO) program ...
  7) Sneeze gracefully ...


(FrankH) Question about 8201? you the guy?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't have an 8201 but shoot anyway.
(FrankH) Anyone know whether there's a pot inside to adjust the trip point of
 the low-batt. light?  Nicad pack tests strong outside the unit but gives 20-40
 mins. service in unit.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) that one is well beyond me. Let me give you some reference
  numbers. Query Bill Grenke 74756,235 on the message board who can find out if
  he doesn't know; also 800-NEC-RBBS and the BB number 312-364-0048 may be able
  to respond PROMPTLY!


(Jim Samuels) I'm using a t200 w/SuperROM and Power-d. any dos from PCSG?
(Mike A.) i think jim's asking if we plan a DOS for the TDD ?
(Jim Samuels) YEs!
(Mike A.) As far as I know, No but I could be quite wrong. I do know Super will
 help you load Floppy with F7.
(Sysop Tony) (What does Jim need in a DOS? There are 3 of them now)
 (Actually 5!)
(Jim Samuels) I was assuming PCSG would work best w/SR.
(Sysop Tony) Well.... there are only so many things you can DO with the TDD.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good assumption IF they had a DOS for the TDD but since they
  market the Chipmunk thay aren't in a big hurry to support the TDD.
  Methinks.
(Jim Samuels) Still, there is going to be a large market in TDD's.
(Mike A.) You're probably right, Dave. I think the Chipmunk is superior on
 almost every count esp. since Super creates some unusual file extensions that
 the Chipper easily handles. TDD is highly limited but I wouldn't be surprised
 if we upgrade its DOS in the future. about all I can say.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike: When you said "one way but not the other" with reference
  to 100/200 chipmunk disk reading, t'wasn't clear to me which was reading
  which. Clarify?? 
(Mike A.) I meant that sending a 200 user a 100 disk would be fine, but reading
 a 200 chipmunk's disk on a 100 would require updated CDOS 3.45 to, for
 example, read a "save All" on a full 200 menu.   is that muddified?


(DaveW.) Mike, I am just starting to play around with M/L access of Chipmonk
 M100 version 3.24 any tips?
(Mike A.) Have you read Tim Ekdom's giant files in DL5?
(DaveW.) No, but have one that talks about RST 7, DB 42, & DB nn.
(Mike A.) I'd refer you to Joel Corley in Dallas as THE expert on CDOS.
 M/L gives me the "I dunno's".
(DaveW.) OK, you may have seen I've been working on the spell check programs
 and I really want to do some serious work with M/L access of the beasty.
 Is 3.24 still the latest version? 
(Mike A.) No, 3.45 is.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Dave, BASIC?.CHP in DL 5 are the files needed. the ?= 1 to 8.
  Just this past week I redid the Keywords on every file in DL 5 so that it
  should be easier to find stuff.  3.45 is for the Model 100.
(Sysop Tony) 'twould seem obvious that the 200 would have a larger folder
 size. And you could not do a "load all" from such a folder, but are you saying
 you need 3.45 to actually access the extra files in the larger folder, or to
 read the data on the disk???   Dave: See Don Corbitt's file MLDEMO.CHP in DL5.
 Don previously mentioned that machine language access of the data on the
 disk would be version dependent, so if you write for 3.24, it probably won't
 work on 3.45.
(Mike A.) Yes, Tony, that's how I understand it. But I haven't actually tried
 it myself, so this is second-hand info. I'd like to thanks you and Dave W and
 the rest for the spellcheck series. I could have used it on a 3-[page Super
 news release in which I just noticed I spelled "wish" as "Eish"....Geez!
(Sysop Tony) Well, remember it was offered to PCSG once.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Must be related to Eish-ka-bibble. Or are you all too young to
 remember. Ah me ...


(Jay M.) I'd like to run a quick, informa, and highly unscientific survey.
 how many of you agree (even in part) with the premise that there's no
 market for laptop computers?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) NO!
(DaveW.) No
(DAVID E) no
(Sysop Tony) (You've gotta be kidding!)
(Mike A.) no way!
(Doug M.) NO
(Sysop .^Dave^.) You better be wrong!! How'd I make a nickel?
(Jay M.) that's what I expected...as a future Compaq employee (I hope),
 maybe I can do some good.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jay, not the least interested in an IBM on a lap speaking for
  myself alone of course, UNLESS ....
  t'was same size as Model 100 ...
(Jay M.) (listening intently)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) with 720K disk, 384 non-volatile RAM and MS-DOS capable.
(Sysop Tony) Seems like current interest is to put a desktop in your lap.
 It don't work.  Laws of physics, you know.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Main point in above was "same size as Model 100" including
  weight . Physics, schmiziks --- changes all the time.
(Mike A.) I agree with Dave on size, but also would insist on a software
 interface as easy as Microsoft's!
(DaveW.) [Hard to put 10MB hard drive on lap.]
(Jay M.) [wanna bet?]
(Jim S.) Bubble mem
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Dave, you KNOW that a 25MB [???] drive is just around the
  corner that weighs only 16 oz!!
(Sysop Tony) (We may get a hard drive for the 100!)
(Jay M.) [oo.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) back to reality ....


(DAVID E) I just also want to thank all that were envolved with the dictionary.
 and bring it to the TDD. i just finished down loading it before coming into
 the sig.  What a task it will be to cut it down to size but i am looking
 forward to it.
(DaveW.) David, What DOS are you using with TDD?
(DAVID E) Powr-disk
(DaveW.) Ok, I just found out Powr-d does not support the NAME AS command.
 have a few revisions I'll be putting up in the DL soon for Powr-d users.
(Doug M.) Just a quick aside to Tony and Dave: I've left a couple of more notes
 to you on the board since I played about A bit more with the Dictionary last
 night. Let me know what you think about the suggestion for getting around the
 NAME command.
(DaveW.) Thanks Doug, not having a TDD makes things hard for me.


(Jim S.) How may I find out how to make files on the T200 main menu invisible?
(Sysop Tony) Download the program that does it and run it.
 Don't recall the name right now.
(Jim S.) Any search clue?
(Sysop Tony) 200
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't have an INVISI.200 listed. Jim, in DL 4, not 5,
  try S/KEY 200 and S/KEY invisible and S/KEY *VIS*
  the latter will catch ANYTHING that has "VIS" in the key word including
  "television" but what the heck.
(Sysop Tony) Download RAMDIR.200. Add 8 to the status byte, and poke it into
 the status address.


(corky) ok...I have TouchBase 1200b modem...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [cheep, cheep, cluck, cluck]
(corky) should be able to upload review in a couple of weeks soon as mainframe
 is switched from synch. to asynch.
(Sysop Tony) [turkeys go "gobble gobble"]
(corky) meantime runs ok on CIS 1200b line, but data errors on dual speed
 300/1200 line. anyone else have info...or info on Volksmodem?  
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not [cheep] I at all [cluck, cheep]
(Sysop Tony) Corky.... once again, you are the leader in the field. You're way
 ahead of everyone else. You're the resident expert, to whom we will refer all
 requests for info.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Corkypert?
(corky) ok will try to upl info in couple of weeks.

(Sysop Tony) [I hear Dave's lunch coming on....]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh, Tony [cheep] gawt it [cluck] right. Take it Tony?
(Sysop Tony) OK... ga and enjoy.


(Jay M.) is the ordering info for Carl Oppedahl's book in the BOOKS.DOC file
 (or whatever) in DL 6?...or if not, could someone pass it on?
(Sysop Tony) No, it's not there. Someone hasn't reviewed it yet.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Inside the Model 100; Weber Systems, Inc.;
  Cleveland, Ohio 44026; 800-851-6018; ISBN 0-938862-31-6
(Jay M.) got it. thanks...and I will write a review when I get and read it.


(Jim S.) Has anyone exp with Sound Sight's bubble mem?
(Sysop Tony) Well, several of us have seen them, but maybe not actually used
 them. What's your question?
(Jim S.) I was hoping for an opinion.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jon Olson 75046,2325 devoted user.


(DAVID E) i will ask if anyone else is thinking of cutting the dictionary down
 to size. i know you don't plan to tony, but has anyone else memtioned it.
(Sysop Tony) Well, since the programs just became available yesterday, I doubt
 that there has been time for many folks to even think about it.
(DaveW.) [Doug M may be interested.]
(Sysop Tony) However, I think along the lines in the message I sent to Dave
 Willman, I'll go the two disk route, and see how it works out.
(DAVID E) i like that idea best.
(Sysop Tony) Personally, I like the idea of the bigger, more complete
 dictionary and hate to have to spend that many hours editing down the Chipmunk
 version.
(DaveW.) [I've got two disk version running in my brain now.]
(Sysop Tony) That, along with the separate letter construction, so the files
 can be edited in RAM would be soooper.
(DAVID E) agreed
(DaveW.) Will work on it. Since I have more than one interested.
(Sysop Tony) We'll whip this TDD into shape yet! The Chipmunk version is
 working fine. Top checking time seems to be about 25 minutes and that's for
 LOOONG files.
(DaveW.) I have a UTLDIC.CHP version, interested?
(Sysop Tony) I haven't explored the capabilities of UTLDIC yet, so can't say
 whether I'd be interested. having a larger dictionary than is even available
 here haven't needed any utilities, but perhaps you should post it for those
 who need it.
(DaveW.) UTLDIC is for look-up,remove,count,print.
(Sysop Tony) Well, as I said, some folks may find it useful.  If you've got it,
 and want to post it, do it.  Neil is still waiting to hear the latest, too.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Over our chickee, Mortimer and I've been Beta testing a gnu
  program that you'll all love: four horse race, with up to four players
  betting - available later today.
(Sysop Tony) Which end do you bet on, Dave???
(DAVID E) [jaws dripping with anticipation]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hollywood Race Track too!
(Sysop Tony) Hollywood Park just opened, looks like someone jumped the gate.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That's it! Hollywood Park!


(Sysop Tony) Let's talk DCPREP & the Tandy 200. Is it going to work on the 200?
(DaveW.) Not in its current form. 
(Sysop Tony) well what needs to be done to get a 200 version?
(DaveW.) ROM calls have to be modified. Maybe a temporary buffer or two also.
(Sysop Tony) Can you provide info on what you need so we can start poking
 around to get it?
(DaveW.) Yeh, manly they're in the DCPREP.SRC listing what ROM calls I make
 and what they do. As for temporary buffers I'll have to look that over again.
(Sysop Tony) OK.... I'll download that and see if I can get some input from a
 few of my contacts. I have a 200 version of Powr-Disk, so have to prep the
 file on the 100, then transfer it to the 200 to check the programs with the
 TDD.  Extra steps.
(DaveW.) Are there any documented ROM CALLS for the 200 posted anywhere?
(Sysop Tony) There's a file in DL4, ROM.200, that has comparative calls
 showing the same routine with addresses for 100 and 200.
(DaveW.) Ok, I'll take a look at it.
(Sysop Tony) Do you have back issue of P 100?
(DaveW.) Most, yes.
(Sysop Tony) June and July last year have some 200 maps.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) For the record have confirmed reservations to LAX on 16-May
  and from Santa Barbara on 18-May.

12:55:27 PM EST Sunday, April 20, 1986

(Sysop Tony) OK.... Looks like we've done it for today.
 So this CO is called to a halt.
 STOP! ALTO!  CEASE DESIST!
 Thanks for coming, and thanks to all those who attended Dave's Chicken
 lunch without costing him anything.  heh heh
 Goo bye all.
