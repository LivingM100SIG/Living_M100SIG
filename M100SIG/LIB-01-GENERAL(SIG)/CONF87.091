(Phil) Jeezz -- bit small today!  Poor PR?

(Sysop Denny) Hi Phil, Looks like a small crowd...you and me!

(Phil) Well, there are people in SIG and DL's; maybe they will join us.

(Sysop Denny) I hope so, you think we could banter back and forth for 2 hours?

(Phil) Re Vans FAST stuff.  My impression is that his tests show no
  improvement over just locking scroll.  Right? 

(Sysop Denny) No, but you can read a little bit more of what's going by.  Ok,
  I guess we can start

(Phil) Ooops -- another 'Phil'  Hi Phil

(Phil W) HI

(Phil) an everyone else.

(R Caley) HI

(Sysop Denny) On FAST, I tried putting a CLS in the routine

(Phil W) Phil, better give it a last init, else will be confusing.

(Phil F) ok

(Sysop Denny) to make it a little more readable and got a quick cold
  start for my efforts. Seems that interrupt is a little sensitive.

(Phil W) True -- and I have not tried the code.  BTW -- wonder  what happended
  to tests of XMDPW2.200? Tnoy's pretty busy I guess.

(Sysop Denny) Yes, things get hectic when he's doing a convention.  Ok folks,
  are you just going to watch us squirm, or does anyone have a topic of interest this morning? :)

(Phil W) [Yea!]

(Sysop Denny) Ah Ha! Finally!

(R Caley) OK...THIS IS A stupid one, but interesting  Has anyone (besides
  me) ever thought that with all the add on "boxes" vendors
  have been snapping on the bottom of an M100  that it might be fun to
  install and "internal" disk drive?

(Sysop Denny) Not a bad idea
  But I think it might take the M100 out of the small portable range.

(Phil W) Yes  maybe it could be called the T600a. Seriously, when you get as
  thick as a PC laptop, and as heavy, and as expensive -- but only ahve a 8x40
  screen, what's the point?

(R Caley) ok..I disagree

(R Caley) First it would not have to be any bigger  than the TSI booster pak
  now available as to price
  it would only be an option like nay other  any other  anyway it seemed like
  an interesting idea.

(Jim A.) hello

(Phil W) But, Rush, a Toshiba T1000 is already only 0.2" thicker than  a bare
  M100 -- and has all the goodies, which is my point.

(R Caley) ok  but I already have a great deal of $$$ tied up  in an M100, and
  I'm not interested in MS-DOS however, I told you it was a bit ridiculous.

(Phil W) Not  ridiculous.  If you take the Modem and some RAM space from a
  Booster pack you could put a third-height 720K drive in with ease.

(Sysop Denny) Hmmm, I know what you mean, RC, but after playing with  Procomm
  and Side Kick on an MS-DOS machine I now have a different view of portable
  laptops.

(R Caley) I probably have a different view  of laptops than most
  I think the original M-100 was a marvel of ingenuity  I don't want to "bring
  my office home" via an MS-DOS computer  I just want a reliable versatile
  adjunct to my usual computer to haul around for quickie jobs  and word
  processing etc I think bringing the desktop HOME  defeats the original
  concept of the M-100's purpose.

(GENE NESTRO) If your looking for more compactness  I use the typeing paper
  stand from RS and reconfigure the sliding paper holder  that it holds the
  Drive (by a thick rubber band underneath the M100, there is about 12 ins
  under it when the m100 is propted up to about 45 degs.

(Phil W) But  RC, why do you feel that way?  If the MS-DOS "desktop" is about
  the  size of a Model 100 (or weighs same as M100 + TDD)  is there a big
  difference to you?  Or is it the Operating system  that is the issue?  Just
  curious what the issues are.

(R Caley) ok  you used the correct word when you said  why do I FEEL that
  way It is definitely an emotional response.....and  if I knew WHY I feel
  about things a certain way they would be THOUGHTS and not EMOTIONS  Ps.
  Just don't like MS-DOS.

(Phil W) Ok  My view is colored by
  my extensive use of PC's, writing PC m/l programs, etc  I find either OS
  just fine -- and I did suffer thru CP/M at one time which makes MS-DOS look
  like a real champ! (done)

(R Caley) ok  I prefer OS-9 (done)

(Sysop Denny) Ok, we're getting a few more Q's  Next up is Ed.  ga Ed  Ooops
  that was William and he's gone Ga Phil F

(Phil F) Another one for the stupid question file  I've seen references to
  various  operating systems  TS-DOS, MS-DOS, C/PM etc.  What's the
  difference?

(R Caley) [yikes]

(Sysop Denny) Well, TS-DOS is a operating

(Phil W) [Significant!]

(Sysop Denny) system for the M100 and TDD  And MS-DOS and CP/M are for desktop
  machines and the new IBM clone portables.

(Phil F) Ok

(Sysop Denny) (haven't seen a CP/M portable)

(Phil F) If the only difference is the machine they work on,

(Phil W) yes you have!

(R Caley) [there is one]

(Phil F) Is it possible to use a disk from TS-DOS to a desktop (I think C/PM)?

(Sysop Denny) Well, yes

(Phil W) [not cp/m]

(Sysop Denny) there is one program that will access the TDD directly called
  Lapdos It uses the COM1 or COM2 ports on the back of an MS-DOS machine to
  access a TDD directly. 

(Phil W) Denny, note taht  the Starlet [nec ???] and the PX-8  Geneva are cp/m
  laptops.

(R Caley) [that's the one]

(Sysop Denny) Oh yes! I used a Geneva
  Yeech!

(Phil W) They aren't bad with disks -- but to have cm/m with no  disk drive is
  somewhat poitless, which is why the M100 is such a good design: OS is
  optimized around NOT having a disk drive but having non-volatile RAM
  instead. MS-DOS laptop with non-volatile rAM will be the logical competitor,
  so you can boot from a RAM disk with DOS in ROM  otherewise will not get
  convenience of turn it on and type.

(Sysop Denny) Phil,  I curious... how many roms does it take for MS-DOS on the
  T1000?

(Phil W) Welll  total OS is 200K.  [includes lots of utilitiues in ROM]

(Sysop Denny) I wonder if they are using the new 1meg roms.  If not, it'd take
  about 8 of them.

(Phil W) Oddly enuff  it is setup as a 720K apparent disk drive, with 500K
  free (but cannot  write to it!)

(Sysop Denny) Well, we digress  Do I need to get the slides out?
  Ah ha! I knew that would do it!

(ERIC WEINSTEIN) I was thinking of  getting a desktop to function  as a DVI,
  for the disk drive and monitor. Has anyone tryed this?

(Sysop Denny) Well,  You're ok as far as using it as a disk drve extension for
  the M100, 

(ERIC WEINSTEIN) I'm too cheap to spend $500 at RS to improve my M100!

(Sysop Denny) (off line storage)  But you wouldn't be able to use the screen
  directly.  (At least I don't think so)
  Why would you spend $500?  (DVI's are on sale at 199)

(ERIC WEINSTEIN) I diidn't know that. Thanks!!

(Phil W) you can  use FLTIBM in DL3 on a PC or compatible and use COM: and a
  device (as a device) in Basic progams on you Model 100  you can then read
  from the PC or write to it, with FLTIBM on the PC set up to eith Send or
  Recieve the ASCII input or output works for only one file at a time, of
  course but I have successfully disassemlved to a PC disk and assembled  from
  one with that technique.   But TDD with third part OS is as fast and a bit
  more portable than my desktop PC (grin)!

(Sysop Denny) Yeah, I'd opt for a TDD before a DVI.

(ERIC WEINSTEIN) I was thinking of this as home base.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, any more on this?

(ERIC WEINSTEIN) The monitor would be a big help, but will  have to stay home.
  Thanks for the help.

(John O'F) Has anyone ever made up a n auto-dial  statement including the "*"
  from the lower left side of the dialing pad. I need to use it to block
  out incoming beeps which knock me off line.

(Sysop Denny) John, You can do that by inserting 1170 instead of *70. Works
  just the same.

(John O'F) perfect...thanks.

(WILLIAM E. SMITH) HI NEW USER AND LOST TO THE MAX. HELP

(Sysop Denny) Well, what are you trying to do, HELP is a little nonspecific.

(DAN H) Hello all, this is my first time here

(WILLIAM E. SMITH) CANT STOP A SCROLL TO PULL UP WHAT I WANT

(Sysop Denny) Hi Dan, We are helping William here first.  You can stop
  scrolling by typing a <CTRL> S and resume by typing <CTRL> Q

(WILLIAM E. SMITH) YES BUT THEN CANT TYPE A COMM.

(Sysop Denny) Is that what you wanted to do? You should be able to type at any
  of the prompts

(WILLIAM E. SMITH) I WANT TO PULL UP DOWNLD AND DOWNLD IT

(Sysop Denny) anywhere else, the typing won't be recognized.  Are you using an
  M100 or T200?

(WILLIAM E. SMITH) WHENI DO AND HIT ENT. I EIGTHER  MOVE ON OR BACK TO M  100

(Sysop Denny) Ok, if you want to start downloading at any point, just hit the
  F2 key  and everything will stop, waiting for input of a filename.  After
  you enter the filename the scroll will continue  and you'll capture
  everything after that point. BUT  We have prepared a file on that subject,
  which provides greater detail than we can in this conference situation. To
  read the file, type the letter B at the main menu function prompt (where you
  can read or leave messages) and press the ENTER key. At the next menu, type
  the number 4 and press ENTER to read the file. Suggest you echo a copy to
  your printer for later review. (Turn on Printer and press F5 button)  OK?

(WILLIAM E. SMITH) OK
  THANK YOU

(Greg) I have a print problem on a tandy 600

(Sysop Denny) Oh

(Greg) Do you think you can help?

(Sysop Denny) Well, you'll have to leave a message for Tony

(Greg) OK

(Sysop Denny) he is our resident 600 expert.  Just use SYSOP for the "To"
  address

(Greg) I Know I've seen a lot of his work.

(Sysop Denny) and he'll help you out.
  Seems like we have a mostly west coast crowd here.
  (I use the term "crowd" loosely)

(Greg) Is it allways this slow?

(Sysop Denny) Heh, heh...

(Greg) ?

(Sysop Denny) Well, when there is no guest or special topic, things slow down
  a bit  and the summer has taken it's toll this year.

(Greg) Where are the other 4 who are here?

(Sysop Denny) Well, two of me are here in LA  along with Phil and Peter.

(Greg) Is it possible to upload Messages?

(Sysop Denny) Yes  You can compose offline, and then use the

(Greg) Is there a file that would explane how?

(Sysop Denny) Oops! you have a 600, right?

(Greg) Right!

(Sysop Denny) Well, it's a little more complicated  but it is possible. Tony
  has the procedure down.

(Greg) I'm set up to use XMODEM but I can reset for M100.

(Sysop Denny) (I'm not sure it's in a file yet)

(Greg) Thanks anyway.

(Sysop Denny) Oh, if you have an M100 also, it's a lot easier  You can just
  use the F3 key at the point where you'd normally  start typing the message.
   (use a width of 79)

(Greg) No I would reset My settings on Comp. & Computer.

(Sysop Denny) You mean on the 600?

(Greg) I have F3 for capture Text and F4 for print text.  Yes.  Talk to Tony.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, well you immiediately lose me when it comes to the 600.

(Greg) Sorry  Well I guess I better go Can't spend too much money!

(Sysop Denny) Ok, no problem.  We might just leave a little early too.

(Greg) Whats the code out?

(Sysop Denny) ^C will work, or /ex.

(Greg) Thanks, Bye

(Sysop Denny) Well, by default, it looks like we're out of time for this
  morning's conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to
  stick around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning,
  we appreciate your input.   Bye.    *** END OF CONFERENCE ***
