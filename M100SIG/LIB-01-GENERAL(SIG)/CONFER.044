(Sysop Tony) Well... I guess we better get this rolling....
 Tap Tap Tap....

(JeffG) Last week I purchased Carl Oppendahl's new book Inside the Model 100.
 Why didn't Tandy put out such a book. TWO YEARS AGO?
(Sysop Tony) Interpreting Tandy's marketing moves is a difficult game. There is
 still no Tech Manual for the Tandy 200. My own personal opinion: Tandy Corp is
 more of a marketing company than a technical support company. It seems they
 sometimes don't even know what they've got.
(Larry L) I have been looking for the book myself. where can I get one?
(Sysop Tony) From what I've heard, you can order it from the publisher, or
 through your local book dealers. The information, phone number, book ID
 number, etc was in last week's conference - or was it the week before?
 You can check in DL8. 
(JeffG) <excellent book>
  [Editors note: Oppedahl, Carl; Inside the Model 100; Weber Systems, Inc.
   8437 Mayfield Road; Cleveland, Ohio; 44026; (800)-851-6018;
   ISBN 0-938862-31-6]

(Larry L) I have decided to purchase an A&J microdrive, but it hasn't arrived
 yet. any users out there?
(Sysop Tony) I doubt that there are any here this morning although we have had
 a couple messages on the board. There's a product description in DL6 and a
 program in DL5 - a way to store the operating system or something.
 One of the honchos of the company came by some time ago and indicated he would
 support the drive here, but he's not been back.
(Larry L) There was a review in port 100/200 this month.  The guy seemed to
 like it, so what the heck. Though I couldn't find any files in DL 5 or 6
 on the drive.
(Sysop Tony) Personally, I think it's a step backwards, but realize there are
 some folks who can only afford that price. try a search with the keywords AJ.
 I know there's something there.
(Larry L) For those of us who cant'afford the $400+ price tag i think its a
 good buy.
(Sysop Tony) Chipmunk is $399, TDD is $170 mail order, DVI is $180.
 OK... Let us know how you like it.

(JeffG) A comment for anyone who might find it useful. The March issue of
 Portable 100/200/600 had an article describing a method to put rechargeable
 NICAD batteries in the 100.  Well, I did it yesterday - did it in 10 minutes.
 I'm running on NICADS now.
(Larry L) you can also use an external battery called a Gel cell, like a small
 car battery but sealed and it will give about 300 hours of use.
(JeffG) Well, I like not having to lug around a large battery pack, and not
 buying alkalines every month.
 The conversion was so easy, that I'd recommend it.
(DaveW.) It's all fine, but nicads are meant to be DEEP CYCLED and most people
 don't use them that way.
(JeffG) ,absolutely true>


(EROL YURTKURAN) {Sysop, How large is your personal 100 library?
(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm. Maybe 30 disks, 300K each, plus or minus.
(EROL YURTKURAN) {Did you get most of it from here?
(Sysop Tony) Hee Hee.... I PUT most of it here!
(PhilW.) [Modest, Tony!]
(DaveW.) [Really, Tony.]
(EROL YURTKURAN) {I see, I see, What I would like to do is open a BBS
 I need some files to open a BBS but it would cost too much to get them from
 here.  Is there anyway I can send you the disks and you copy them for me?
(Sysop Tony) No, Erol... all my files and programs are covered by copyrights,
 as are all the files on the entire CompuServe system. You'll have to contact
 individual authors of anything you wish to use, get their permission, and have
 them send you copies.
(EROL YURTKURAN) {If they put them up here they must give their permission
(Sysop Tony) Implied permission is granted for single use, not for
 redistribution. In other words, you can download and use such files for your
 own benefit, but you cannot pass them on to others, or make commercial use of
 them.
 That's in your CIS agreement which you signed when you got your ID Number.
(EROL YURTKURAN) I see, can you give me your address, so I can write
(Sysop Tony) You can Email me anything via the system's EasyPlex...
 just send it to my PPN, 76703,4062.
(EROL YURTKURAN) This way would be cheaper
(Sysop Tony) Cheaper or more expensive, the answers are still the same.
 You can't use copyrighted files.
 I'll send you my mail address via EasyPlex later today.


(PhilW.) Just got the May (!) Port 100/200/600.  Some interesting stuff.
 One thing is a good address translation table, Model 100 to Tandy 200
 including user RAM.  Looks like some of the programs that use m/l calls and
 pokes can now be easily converted.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, I saw you mention that on the board... where did you find it?
(PhilW.) Walden books in Torrance.  Have also had recent issues at B Dalton
(Sysop Tony) Hmmmmm. Wonder if they are going back to bookstore/newsstand
 distribution. Subcription only never meade any sense to me.
(PhilW.) I'd say they are.  Have found them in several areas
(Sysop Tony) That's interesting....
(Thom) Here, too.
(Sysop Tony) Would be nice if they made some sort of public announcement.
 But then, they never have been "user friendly".
(PhilW.) Plus they are publishing much earlier now.
(Sysop Tony) the difference in mailing vs direct distribution time.


(DAVID E) anything new on spell checker?
(Sysop Tony) Dave has been working on the TDD versions of the spelling
 checker and I've been betaq testing them. We now have a version available that
 will allow use of a single or double disk dictionary or in fact the dictionary
 on any number of disks so you can have as large a dictionary as you want.
 The Chipmunk Disk Dictionary transfers to two TDD disks quite well, But is
 cumbersome to download the two files for C&D and S&T due to size. You have to
 use an empty 32K machine to get them down. What else do you need to know?
(DAVID E) I just wanted to find out how it was coming. I have the munk
 dictionary files now and have been playing with it. when do you think they
 will be available? the programm that is.
(Sysop Tony) I'd guess later this week, but it depends on Dave's schedule,
 how he feels about it, etc. I just got the utility program yesterday to beta
 test. As you know the TDD versions are somewhat different, due to the
 difference in the two disk drives. But it IS coming.
(DAVID E) sounds good to me


(Thom) Just wondering if anybody knows anything about TDD DOS's on ROM for the
 200 coming down the road, OR how Peter at PG design is coming with his 128K
 continuous RAM bank for the 200?
(Sysop Tony) On the ROM question, Both Ultimate ROM II and SUPER ROM have
 "loader programs" on the ROM. TS-DOS from Traveling Software also allows
 T-Word to read and print from the disk without any DOS being present.
 Mike Anders has mentioned they are looking into putting a more complete DOS on
 a future ROM release, but I don't know if it will be combined with existing
 packages. Nothing exists right now, however.
(Thom) Sigh...that still means that I've got an effective 15K limit on file
 sizes.  Anything on Peter?
(Sysop Tony) No, actua;lly you and Mel Snyder are the principal sources of
 information with respect to PG Design's possible release of a RAM expansion
 product. Afraid if Peter doesn't move soon, the "window" will be closed.
(Thom) I agree.  I played for several hours Friday with the new IBM portable.
 Very interesting.
(pablo Orsolani) IS IT POSSIBLE THAT TANDY WILL INTRODUCE MEMORY
 LARGER THAN 24K?
(Sysop Tony) Somehow, none of the IBM products interest me.
 Pablo... It's possible, but not probable.
(Thom) I agree about IBM, and the new portable still weighs as much as a sewing
 machine. The Osborne affliction is still with us, I guess.


(pablo Orsolani) WHERE CAN I GET PROGRAMS FOR MY NEW 200?
(Sysop Tony) You can get any number of programs from the data library of
 this Forum.  What are you looking for?
(pablo Orsolani) I am looking for appointment programs etc. is there a listing
 of all programs available for 200 in dl?
(Sysop Tony) Well, there are several "scheduling" type programs in DL2.  Sounds
 like you haven't looked around very much yet.
(pablo Orsolani) that is correct. I am new to this.
(Sysop Tony) There are numerous catalogs in various sections and the ones for
 you to look for would be SCHEDL.CAT in DL2.


(Karl Newton) I have one question about the DVI for the M100. I have broken
 those "fragile" pin on the connector cable
(Karl Newton) Is there a  connector cable for M100 to DVI with STRONG pins?
(Sysop Tony) You can get one from PG Designs for about $15 as I understand.
(Karl Newton) correct I've busted two Tandy ones even being very careful!
(Sysop Tony) Do you have or need PG Design's address? Phone (313) 727-2744.
 PG Design Electronics, 66040 Gratiot, Richmond MI 48062.


(JIM R) I'm running into a conflict with super and powr-disk for the 100
(PhilW.) Jim, what are the symptoms?
 Is it with POWR-D alone or using one of the DL5 menu programs?
(JIM R) I have to restart the powr-d by keeping it on the ram files.
 it is powr-d alone. I get a error 55 othewise
(DaveW.) [Powr-D alone with Super?]
(PhilW.) Ed Geise left a message re a conflict a couple of weeks ago.
 I think it related to use with a menu utility tho.  scratchin head..
 but I don't remember details.
(JIM R) same problem if menu is used. also had to cold start trying to use
 term.ba and powr-d. I'm learning the pitfalls of ml programs
(PhilW.) [jim, try 'CLEAR256, MAXRAM' after running Super.]
 there are such pitfalls.  But I have had no serious conflicts with POWR-D
 and Super.


(DaveW.) [Tony, did I miss something about spell checker while I was in Talk?]
(Sysop Tony) when do you suppose you'll update the file in DL5 to correct for
 the NAME AS difference, and perhaps to handle more than one disk dictionary?
(DaveW.) The spell check program is ready to upload now (including doc.)
 the others I'm still testing at this time, but expect to have them up in the
 next couple of weeks.
(Sysop Tony) I have not yet had time to test the utility programs you sent me
 yesterday. Let me say this about that....
 The "Spelling Checker" has been one hell of a project! I've been working on it
 for over six months... and now Dave has been on it for three months!
 It's more than a weekend project!  Right, Dave?
(DaveW.) Sure is; constantly updating to include better features and I'm still
 not TOTALLY happy with execution speed. Have had some odd 30 copies downloaded
 from DL and only about 3 people actively commenting. I REALLY appreciate the
 comments and help I'm getting.
(Sysop Tony) Yeah... that's a serious problem. We get lots of downloaders, who
 never say anything unless the program doesn't work. We had one file here with
 a serious program error, and yet there were about 800 downloads before
 somebody said there was an error in the file.

(Dana H.) WHAT ABOUT a program to interface a model 100 and a TDD?
(Sysop Tony) Dana... one comes with the TDD... It's called FLOPPY.CO (grin).
 Then you could get DSKMGR.100 here in DL5. Or buy one of the three that make
 the machine REALLY useful.  
(Dana H.) I didn't mean the Tandy disk drive.  I meant a Telecommunicaton
 device for the deaf!
(Sysop Tony) That's another problem. The TDD for the deaf uses another code
 system, which is not compatible with ASCII codes uses by almost all computers.
 There are, however, some devices which interface, and convert the codes.
 See them advertised occassionally in various magazines.  Don't know about any
 specific one, though.
(Dana H.) I'm getting a DVI on closeoqq. Why is interfacing the 100 with video
 still so expensive? I'm getting a DVI on closeout for a good price but wonder
 why the video interface on the market costs so much (portable)
(Sysop Tony) You consider $180 expensive for a video interface AND a disk
 drive?
(Dana H.) No, I mean one that has been advertised for $250 for video alone.
(Sysop Tony) Well, what that company decides to charge for their products is
 based on their own interests. We have no idea why they price stuff the way
 they do.

(Sysop Tony) We've come to the end of our allotted time, folks...
 Ending the conference...
 but feel free to stick around and talk all you like.  Thanks for coming.
