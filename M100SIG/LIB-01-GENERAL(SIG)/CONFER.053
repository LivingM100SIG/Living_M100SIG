(Mel Snyder) Hello

(Sysop Tony) Ahhh... Sunday morning... Coffee, Bach, and a good conference.
 Hi Mel. ga

(Mel Snyder) I need the printer codes for a TTX -- specifically, the bold face
 I left my book home...here in SF...and cold started... ga

(Sysop Tony) Well, hopefully, someone will come to the CO that has them for you...
 ga Dave ga

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mel, just dropped in> ....
 printer codes for TTX??? ga

(Mel S.) Yes -- specifically, for bold face, but underline and ital would be nice, too
(Mel S.) Ga

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, just a second and I'll open my brief case ...
 all packed up for trip to Seattle this afternoon ...

(Sysop Tony) Well for goodness sake... how about that!

(Sysop Tony) [Send "Q" to ask a question or change the subject, "C" to comment on the...
 current topic.  "Q" gets you in the speaking Lineup.
 [Lineup = Mel

(Mel S.) Thanks -- I use the SuperRom, so I need the numbers Waiting for a briefcase to open...

(Sysop Tony) Good Morning Mike.

(Mike A.) Good morning!

(Sysop Tony) Mike... 
 a question came up at the LAUGH-IN yesterday....
 If a person buys a second Chipmunk...
 does he have to get the software with the second drive?  ga

(Mike A.) I don't think so...

(Sysop Tony) [Lineup = Mel, Elisa]

(Mike A.) And Larry Holmes has a bunch of reworked ones sans software. ga

(Sysop Tony) Well then....
 wouldn't the second drive, purchased from PCSG, be $100 less?  ga

(Mike A.) Aaahhhhh, ya got me there!...
 I will have to check it out Monday.ga

(Sysop Tony) There was more than a little interest in two-drive...
 setups yesterday.  Might be a good idea...
 to bone up on that questin.  

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mel ....
 ESC E for emphasized mode ....
 ESC F to resume normal. Okay?? ga

(Mel S.) Any chance you could turn to the page where it gives the codes in
 decimals...like "0271452"???
 There's a list of them, I remeber

(Sysop .^Dave^.) looking ...


(Sysop Tony) ga Mike ga

(Mike A.) Thanks..
 Just wanted to tell Mel that Super 1.8 update has arrived for the 200...
 I'll be sending 'em out this week.  ga

(Mel S.) Excellent -- I am going to Tokyo on/talk job 45

(Dave4 and Mel went into /TALK mode)

(Sysop Tony) ga Elisa ga

(ELISA L) I MET SOME OF YOUI MET SOME OF YOU YEASTERDAY I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI!

(Sysop Tony) Oh... THAT Elisa! ....
 Well, it was nice to see you.... both of you!
 got a question for us?

(ELISA L) NO THANKS, IT'S MY FIRST TIME I'LL JUST LISTEN IN!

(Sysop Tony) OK....
 Well, not much activity this morning.

(Mike A.) [excitement's killing me!]

(Sysop Tony) The M102 was confirmed again yesterday...
 The dinner was fine, thanks....
 Peter St. Clair has gone wild again...

(Donald) Are there any terminal programs for the 100 with...
 full things like procedures, macros, etc.?

(Sysop Tony) No.... There just isn't enough room within the Model 100
 environment... There is an Xmodem implementation....
 and there are terminal emulators...
 but no "full" communication program.  ga

(Donald) Do you think there'd be any market for one, say in ROM?

(Sysop Tony) I really doubt it...
 the Model 100 is designed more as a terminal....
 and it has built-in, plain-vanilla software...
 and you add Xmodem, or X-tel, and you can...
 do almost anything you want...
 No macros, no string evaluation of incoming data....
 nothing fancy... but servicable. ga

() (corky) [bye]

(Sysop Tony) (ahhhh... the rats and the sinking ship syndrome...)

() (corky) <squeek>

(Sysop Tony) Well, it's just the 4 of us....
(Sysop Tony) What's new, Dave??? ga

(DaveW.) Now down to three...

(Sysop Tony) Gad!  It's getting worse!!!
 Was it something I ate???

(DaveW.) What's on the horizons as far as...
 Tandy shows or conferences? ga

(Sysop Tony) I dunno....
 I don't get that sort of inside info...
 maybe Dave??? ga ^Dave^ ga

(Sysop .^Dave^.) nope

(DaveW.) Tony,....
 I now have a version of DCPREP.100....
 that optionally auto-runs and....
 auto-kills the loader program. ga

(Sysop Tony) Neat! ....
 DCPREP came up in conversation yesterday....
 How come you strip duplicates before the sort....
 seems like sorting first would put the dupes together...
 so they could be found easier.  ??? ga

(DaveW.) Sorting takes more time as it...
 usually needs to take multiple passses...
 so killing dupes first ends up...
 normally safing a good bit of processor time. ga

(Sysop Tony) That's exactly what Denny Thomas postulated! ...
 Thought I'd ask. 

(DaveW.) I tried it both ways, normally...
 there is a fair amount of time savings. ga

(Sysop Tony) Hello, Phil

(Phil) Looks like a small group today, Tony

(Sysop Tony) Very....
 Must be something I said....
 Is this a holiday or something???
 So far the transcript is going to be NOTHING!!!

(Phil) Santa Barbara Day!!!

(Sysop Tony) (And Dave enjoys watching me struggle...)

(Phil) "Dave is trying to make his 600 work with my LQ printer (that's a struggle)!!'

(Rich L) Good morning......has anyone reported...
 any problems with the TS-DOS system???...ga.

(Sysop Tony) What sort of "problems" ga

(Rich L) With the PCSG memory expansion......and the TS-DOS....
 I wiped out the directory to several disk...ga.

(Sysop Tony) I don't recall anyone reporting that particular problem...
 but it seems to be a case of TS-DOS not being compatible...
 with the Menu or copying software...
 Not everything is comnpatible with everyting else, you know.... ga

(Rich L) I found out the hard way....
 It works ok if the bank copy, ROM, program is not installed...
 If the f3 is pressed it works good...ga.
(JIM ROBERTS) I'VE NOTED AS HAVE OTHERS SEVERAL...
 CONFLICTS WITH SUPER AND PWDR-D COULD BE SAME HI MEM PROBLEM? GA

(Sysop Tony) The problem is....
 no manufacturer can make his stuff compatible...
 with every other product on the market...
 there are bound to be conflicts.  We just have to learn...
 about them, and work around them.  ga Phil ga

(Phil) Jim, Check SUPER.PD in DL5 ga Tony ga

(DaveW.) Most manufacturers....
 don't even make on honest attempt...
 to make their software compatible...
 When will they catch on to....
 using relocatable codes or...
 loaders and if they utilize....
 hooks why not look at where the hook...
 is programmed to go and send it....
 back there when they're done with it. ga

(Sysop Tony) Every ML programmer assumes...
 his will be the only program you'll be using....  ga Rich ga

(Rich L) meanwhile....
 I wiped out 28 disk of info loading dos100...
 Don't get me wrong...
 The ts-dos works great IF....
 you do not use the ROM program that...
 comes with the PCSG expansion...ga...over.

(Sysop Tony) Again....
 seems like both programmers want to use the same RAM space for their...
 little "jewels"...  Looks like you need to...
 go back to the technique of only having one ML program active...
 at any time.  ga

(Rich L) Just wanted to...
 let it be know about the...
 conflick so others...
 wouldn't do the same as me...they
 should put a warning in the book...ga

(Sysop Tony) Why not put a message on the board?  More folks will read that....
 than the transcript of the conference.  ga

(Rich L) will do...have written PCSG too....ga/

(Sysop Tony) It may be a case of....
 one company simply not knowing what the other company's software...
 is doing.  Remember, Traveling Software and PCSG are competitors.  ga

(Rich L) that's all here....ga...getting off soap-box...ga

(Sysop Tony) OK....

(DaveW.) [Not ALL m/l programmers, Tony. Although I admit to the power 
 down reset goof.]

(Sysop Tony) (Well, your's are one of the few I've seen that relocate 
 themselves!)

(JIM ROBERTS) DOES ANYONE KNOW OF PROBLEMS WITH TRAVELING...
 SOFTWEARS SCREAN ALTERING PROGRAM WITH PWDR-D...
 OR SUPER ROM, I'M THINGING OF GETING IT BUT WONDER ABOUT PROBLEMS. GA

(Sysop Tony) JIm....
 You're talking about 3 different companies...
 all of whom are trying to deal with accessing the new disk drive....
 in different ways....
 I'd be surprised if ANYTHING was compatible between them!!!  There are reports..
 of difficulties and conflicts between them... we were just...
 discussing one of them.  ga Rich ga

(Rich L) I've used power-d since before they really came out...
 and have never ran into any problems..
 with anything...it's self-protected...ga...

(Sysop Tony) Well...
 Both Ultimate Rom II and Super ROM have routines to load the DOS...
 the question is WHAT DOS!  ...
 Neither will load POWR-DISK; ....
 Ultimate attempts to load TS-DOS... Super attempts to load FLOPPY.CO...
 POWR-DISK and TS-DOS  aren't exactly the same....
 and on and on...  ga Jim ga

(JIM ROBERTS) NEW VERSION OF SUPER? MINE DOESN'T.GA

(Sysop Tony) New version of Super... Yes... 1.8 I think is the latest.  ga
 (It changes about every week)

(JIM ROBERTS) THANKS ANY EXCANGES BEING MADE WHO CAN I...
 LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, they will exchange it....
 Either contact Mike Anders on the message board....
 or call PCSG in Dallas to make arrangements....
 They send the new one, then you return the old one. ga

(JIM ROBERTS) THANKS, I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO GO NICE CHATING BYE.

(Sysop Tony) OK... bye. ga Rich ga

(Rich L) Even with the trouble with ts-dos...
 it's worth taking out the little..
 bank copy routine...just because of the 
 great "SAVE ALL" of the ts-dos.....it's
 just like changeing banks,,everthing..
 being saved to one name...ga...

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's a nice feature....
 It's a big plus on the Chipmunk, too...
 POWR-DISK doesn't have that feature...
 I generally load and run single programs, so either....
 would be fine for me.  Of course, I have both of them anyway.  ga

(Rich L) I have both also....and ts-dos for the 200...
 if you have ts-dos and a disk drive theres...
 no need for multi-banks....ga..

(Sysop Tony) You're generally right....
 having a disk drive changes the way you use the portable computer anyway...
 but there are really very few users who could not do better with a disk...
 than expansion modules... particularly since the TDD and an OS is less money!

(Sysop Tony) However....
 there are always a few, whose particular application demands...
 they use internal memory instead of disk...
 and you can't convince them that the extra capability of the disc...
 or the storage increase, justifies carrying an extra piece of equipment.
 (end soapbox)

(DaveW.) [i.e. weight and size limitations.]

(Sysop Tony) Right!
 Just went through that with Thom Hartmann, who needs a portable printer.
 size and weight outweigh all other factors.

(Sysop Tony) Hello, Rich Monosson...
 we don't recognize folks as they come in and say Hi....
ony) [Send "Q" to ask a question or change the subject, "C" to comment on the...
 current topic.  "Q" gets you in the speaking Lineup.
 [Lineup = 0

(Rich Monosson) HI. I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS Q
 CAN U READ THIS?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, of course... go ahead.

(Rich Monosson) OK, TAKES TIME I C. ANYWAY, R U IN THE LA AREA?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I am in the LA area.  Is that important?  ga
 Rich, "ga" means I am through talking, you can "go ahead"   ga

(Rich Monosson) OK, AS I SAID I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH CO. GA

(Sysop Tony) Rich.... meaning no disrespect...
 that's apparent...  Suggest you review the file CONFER.HLP prior next...
 conference to familiarize yourself with how we run the conferences...
 the commands, etc...  OK?  ga

(Rich Monosson) YES, I WILL ALSO CALL BACK AT 300 BAUD, MUCH CHEAPER GA

(Sysop Tony) Yes!!!!  We do a lot of waiting for other people to type....
 the $$$ difference is significant.  ga

(Rich Monosson) YES, I WILL LOGOFF NOW. THANKS FOR THE PATIENCE GA

(Sysop Tony) OK... see you again.

(Rich L) ok....does anyone know when the...
 Mod-102 is going to be out?...ga.

(Sysop Tony) This summer.  Exactly when, they won't say.  ga

(Rich L) ok...great...and the ms/dos chip for thr 600?...ga.

(Sysop Tony) I know nothing about an MS-DOS chip for the 600.  I suspect the M102 will...
 be delayed until the stock of M100's is depleted.  ga

(Rich L) I see...the ms/dos new for the 600...
 was released at the same time...I expected..
 they would already be out...ga..

(Sysop Tony) When was it released??? ga

(Rich L) Maybe I should say that a diff. way...
 I heard about them at the same time... ga

(Sysop Tony) Interesting...
 I haven't heard anything about an MS-DOS chip... we'll see....
 ga Curtis ga

(Curtis G) Tony what are the dirreriences..
 between the m100 & the proposed m102? ga

(Sysop Tony) Fewer IC chips....
 about 1/2 inch thinner....

(Curtis G) any more ram or rom space?... 

(Sysop Tony) otherwise, pretty much the same.  No more RAM or ROM, but compatible...
 with all previous software.  In other words....
 just a new model that's probably cheaper to make.

(Rich L) The slim-line 102 has the bus bar on the back like the 200...ga.

(Sysop Tony) That's a possibility... although I haven't seen one yet.  ga

(Rich L) and... the ms/dos chip is "THE" reason the 600 didn't...
 come with a basic chip....the ms/dos chip..
 has always been in the planning...there's
 a slot for it in all 600's....ga..

(Sysop Tony) Well, there's a socket for something...
 but of course no information is provided by Tandy, so anything that comes...
 out is generally a "leak"....
 "Leaks" and rumors are generally only 50% right...
 but then, what do I know????

(Rich L) this.....:leak" is from tandy...and you can..
 bank on this one...ga..

(Sysop Tony) I have to deal with the official publications....
 and what becomes available in the newsletters....
 everything else is a rumor.  ga

(Rich L) right... I understand....
 the 102 parts are already in the repair
 shops here in Atlanta...ga..

(Sysop Tony) Atlanta is a priveleged area...  Lots of parts...
 but no M102's yet.  (grin)...   ga

(Rich L) but the parts are here...meaning that the 102's shouldn't
 be to far behind...ga..

(Sysop Tony) You may be right....
 they will probably be cycled in as M100 stocks are depleted in the area...
 warehouses.  ga

(Rich L) gee..somebody else jump in here....ga...over..

(Sysop Tony) Well.... shall we cut this morning's conference short....
 and go out and enjoy the sun???  ga

(Sysop Tony) OK... if nobody has any thing else to talk about....
 We'll let this one die a natural death...

(Curtis G) Agreeded

(DaveW.) Diddo.

(Sysop Tony)  OK.... CO is officially ended.
