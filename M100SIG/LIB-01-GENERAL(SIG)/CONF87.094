9:00 AM PDT Sunday, September 27, 1987

(Sysop Tony) Good Morning.

(Sysop Denny) Hi Tony

(Sysop Tony) Denny, If I knew you was gonna be here  I'da slept in.

(Phil) Well, at least you have some one to chat with

(Sysop Denny) Well, I'm only here for about 10 min. Working today.

(Sysop Tony) Well, I got home at 4 am.

(Phil) Gee, heavy date, Tony?

(Sysop Denny) Well, I know how that feels!

(Sysop Tony) Setting up for the "Osmonds" concert in Reno tonight.

(Phil) Gawd -- how wholesome!

(Sysop Tony) Would you believe... their crew chief  wouldn't allow anyone
  who smoked to work the call!  (grin)

(Phil) Fascinating!

(Sysop Tony) Mormons, you know.  Well, does anyone have a topic to get us
  going this morning? There's one. .... ga Bob

(bob judge) can any one give an example of how to respond to "oldest file in
  days(?) option prompt when "browsing"?

(Sysop Tony) With a number  like 7 for 7 days old.   That sort of thing.

(bob judge) thanks

(Sysop Tony) Lessee.... you can get an alphabetical list  specifying age in
  days, with the command BRO *.*/age:7

(bob judge) interesting; thanks again

(Sysop Tony) Well, as they normally list, you get  last in, first out in the
  list.  It's so much nicer to have them alphabetical.  ga Denny

(Sysop Denny) That's neat, I never thought about using the *.*
  I suppose that would work with S *.* as well.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, it does.  Those are called "switches"... there are several
  of them ...

(Sysop Denny) (or S *.* /DES)

(Sysop Tony) *.* is one, /DES is one,   /KEY is another, and /AGE is the
  fourth you can combine any two.  Like in S /AGE:7/DES etc.

(bob judge) thanks very much

(Sysop Denny) I thought the only way to get a alphabetical list was to S
  A?????.*  then B???? etc. Thats much better.

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmmm.... gee..... that should have been in the syop manual.
  It's been around for a long time.  I used to use it for catalogging,  and
  now Eiji uses it regularly.

(Sysop Denny) (what Sysop manual (grin))

(Sysop Tony) Oh No!  You don't mean to tell me... (pause)  Where's my slides?

(Tom S.) Hi...Q about the Tandy 600  I have been working for hours trying to
  format a document it's the page length that I'm having trouble with.  doesn't
  seem to change when different top and bottom margins are added.

(Sysop Tony) Well, page length is always the same  6 lines per inch, 66 lines
  per page.

(Tom S.) That's what I thought  but when you change top and bottom margins
  then do a repaginate the page breaks should reflect the margin changes,
  shouldn't they?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, if the margins affect the actual formatting.  If you don't
  quite fill a page, they might not have any affect.

(Tom S.) Well, with top and bottom margins set  at 3, 4, 5, or 6
  the page length still only fills 2/3 of a page.

(Sysop Tony) Well, assuming you have more than 2/3 page of data  and it
  continues on the  next page.... and it only gives you 2/3 of a page too then
  it would appear that it's not formatting correctly.  Are you specifying
  "Formatted" in the Print menu?

(Tom S.) I think that I have specified "formatted"  but I'll take a break to
  check.  I am printing a four page document, and there is only 2/3 of a page
  on each  page regardless of type of printer  I'll go 10/10 and check.
  Thanks!

(Sysop Tony) Wait!  That isn't right, of course.  Leave me a message on the
  board to remind me and I'll try it after the CO, and get back to  you. OK?

(Tom S.) Ok, Tony. Thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... on to Larry.  ga Larry

(Larry R.) OK  some programs have hot keys; that is, when you enter a key, you
  do not have to enter <CR> each time  just press a key.  I want to incorporate
  that feature into a project.  How do I write the Input or whichever lines to
  get that feature?

(Sysop Tony) OK  there are two ways, depending on whether you want a flashing
  cursor on the screen to indicate waiting for input.  If you do, then you use
  the form Q$=INPUT$(1)  ..... The program will wait forever for a
  keypress; you may need to follow that with an IF-THEN to interpret the
  input: IF Q$ = "Y" OR Q$ = "y" THEN (Yes...)  The above gives you a flashing
  cursor.  The second way is with a self-looping statement  as in:

  10 A$=INKEY$:IF A$ = "" THEN 10

  This form presents no cursor, and will continue to loop until any key is
  pressed.

(Larry R.) So  I use one of these lines in lieu of the usual  10 INPUT"PRESS
  KEY";A$ type of line???

(Sysop Tony) Yes..... I'd do this:

  10 PRINT"Press any key   ";:Q$=INPUT$(1)

(Larry R.) okay  let's see if Ted has something to add???

(Ted) You can also enable the function keys if you don't want to hang up the
  program

(Larry R.) What  I want is to set up a program where the operator can press
  any number key and get a randomized response, or press  any letter key to
  end the program and return to either BASIC or to the top menu, via a closing
  screen The idea is to make a model 100 program that will function like  one
  of those old 8 balls that you ask it a question flip the ball over and a
  random answer appears.  Is there already such a  critter in DL???  After
  all why reinvent thr wheel???

(Sysop Tony) Function keys don't really apply to what you want to do, but of
  course they COULD be used.  There are other approaches, too.  But there isn't
  a program of that sort available here yet.

(Larry R.) RATS!!!

(Phil) [An opportunity, Larry!]

(GENE NESTRO) What about the 2 or 3 AI progs here?  they can be altered.

(Sysop Tony) Possibly... Can you point Larry to some names?  (Darn noisy phone
  line today!)

(GENE NESTRO) I'm looking up the latest UP  but 1 of the original was "Deety"

(Larry R.) Which DL???

(GENE NESTRO) [SEARCHING]

(Sysop Tony) I think it would be easier to start from scratch.  You have a
  three line program and a bunch of branch print statements.  Sort of like
  chinese fortune cookies. (Help! I'm being held prisoner in a Chinese bakery!)

(Larry R.) That, I believe, is the basic idea.  I guess I can go play with
  that.  I want to take junior here to a hallowe'en party as a fortune teller.

(GENE NESTRO)  [ DL 5 ]

(Tom S.) Format was on "yes"  left a message for you under T 600

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Anyone else on Larry's program idea?

(GENE NESTRO) Latest UP was "DEJAH.BA" dl5  ga  done

(Sysop Tony) OK

(Larry R.) Bye 4 now

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm  I remember one such program...  It's not here, it's on a
  North Star I have that's called Zodiac.  You give it your zodiac sign  and
  it comes back with a perfectly AWFUL character analysis. (grin) "You are a
  shallow individual. Self-centered, and ambiguous."  etc... Guess I could port
  it over, if I could find it.  (grin)

(GENE NESTRO) RE: New use for M100  Have a client who uses the 100 to prime
  his 1200 ie, his printer to use the 1200.

(Sysop Tony) On the topic of odd uses  There was a fellow here some time ago,
  who used the 100 as a diagnostic tool for printers.  His program would
  output various commands and the printer would step through it's paces.
  Interesting. 

(GENE NESTRO) Yup!

(Sysop Tony) It's too bad the external A-D converters cost so much. A lot could
  be done with the 100's.

(GENE NESTRO) Here's one for you...the month of Dec,  I sold 26 m100 or 102's
  & applied for a part time job  with RS & didn't get hired

(Sysop Tony) Well, you wouldn't want to work for minimum wage, anyway.   The
  salaries for salesmen there are really considered to be sub-par for sales
  people.  It's very low, plus a small commission.  It's so bad, actually,
  that there is a constant turnover of sales folks in the computer stores as
  they make contacts through sales, and then move into the commercial world.
  ...  Anyway, back to the printer situation there are several printer "setup"
  programs in DL2. I have one such for the Epson's that I can load into one
  computer,  set the printer the way I want it, then switch to the other
  computer for data printing.  It's useful.

(GENE NESTRO) My favorite, that I never Up uses the F  keys  [ Up = uploaded ]

(Sysop Tony) Well, that's an idea... but it would seem limited.  How do you do
  it, exactly, in the program?

(GENE NESTRO) ON KEY  etc  I'd upload it, but I think there are enuff progs
  of that type

(Sysop Tony) But that only gives you 8 choices  unless you use sub-menus.

(GENE NESTRO) rite on the 8 choices  but I have one in the DL that gives  12 0r
  14 - DMP 105 specific

(Sysop Tony) I think I have 12 on my menu, but probably only use 3 or 4 of
  them with any regularity.  So a function key driven one would probably work
  for me, too.  It's just that it _seems_ so limiting.  (grin)  Any more on
  this topic?

(GENE NESTRO) it is! but I very seldom use underline etc  ga  done

(Sysop Tony) Actually, I don't use underline that much either   but I do use
  Pica, Elite, Compressed, and Superscript a lot.  I also use 8 LPI
  occassionally.  There is a tip file I did once on archiving documents in
  subscript, at 10 LPI to save mucho on paper.

(GENE NESTRO) I'm familiar on your tip I use it!

(Sysop Tony) Great.  You know, I did that about the same time as the PHONEBOOK
  program which used some of the same techniques and there has been a lot of
  interest in that phone book program.  I ran across a guy at work a couple
  weeks ago who I didn't know from Adam, and he had a list of stuff  produced
  with that program!  Floored me!

(GENE NESTRO) You remember me - I'm the guy who reworked Phone.BA with...Lildos
  Etc  & printed Disk Directories

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, yeah  I remember.  I've been working on a list of
  frequencies used by the Hotel/Resort/Casinos in Northern Nevada  using the
  program, for the benefit of those who want to evesdrop.

(GENE NESTRO) How do you get these freqs? I'm only 2 hrs from Atlantic City

(Sysop Tony) Well.... first, you need a scanner radio, so you can monitor the
  business band and you can figure out, from listening, what some of them are.
  ... There's also a company in one of the Eastern states that publishes a
  book listing many of the license holders on the business band.  They also
  have some listings, sorted by state.  I can get you an address if you want
  it.  Other than that, you need to ask around.  The Radio Shack books are no
  good unless you're looking for Police and "Public Service" freqs.

(GENE NESTRO) Be interested  But how does the FCC fell about business bands  I
  assume they're not private

(Sysop Tony) No, not really "private"... they're shared frequencies  There is,
  of course, an old law stating that you can monitor any channel you want but
  can't disclose the substance of any communications you overhear.

(GENE NESTRO) old law "The airways belong to the American Public"  [ FCC ]

(Sysop Tony) True... but like everything that's regulated, there are lawyers
  involved.  And when they get involved, they muddle up everything for
  everybody.

(GENE NESTRO) Years ago I rigged CB radios in autos  with phone patches at a
  base station for telephone from car

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, that was done in the early days.  The CB band is now
  virtually unregulated.  You buy a radio, and assign yourself call letters,
  and go on.  Unless you are causing somebody some real interference, you'll
  be totally ignored.  Interesting on the phone patches, though  they're not
  legal on the lower band, and were recently outlawed on the GMRS 460 mhz
  band, too.  Now if you want a legal phone patch you gotta get a business
  or ham license.

(GENE NESTRO) I used CB channels below CH 1... I guess about 26.100 etc

(Sysop Tony) Tch, Tch, Tch.  Illegal, you know.  Lots of folks in the LA area
  switched channel 10 crystals  putting the Rec Xtal in the Xmt socket, and
  vice versa. It threw them below the band, and on an even freq, instead of an
  odd freq.  Some fellows also used the 5 channels "hidden" in among the
  original 23 for RC uses.

(GENE NESTRO) You bringing back mems  I always used the "dime" side  26.100
  instead of 26.105 ("nickel" side)

(Sysop Tony) Ah, the old days. .....  I remember them well.  Palomar
  linears.... (foot warmers, the truckers called them....)  etc. ......
  Little activity on CB any more..... I understand that a lot of hams are
  buying old CB's and converting them for use on 10 meter phone.  There's even
  some info on how to make them into FM transceivers.  I think novices now can
  use phone in 10 meters, and it's a low-cost start for them.

(GENE NESTRO) I used to run 250 Watts in car & 2000+ at base station

(Sysop Tony) Oh, you were one of those guys who could be heard all accross the
  country, huh?

(GENE NESTRO) I wonder if radio trans (CB - HAM) were prone to buy m100  Yes I
  talked all over the world on CB bands

(Sysop Tony) I don't know.  But CompuServe's CB emulator is one of the most
  popular products on the service.  They have two forums to carry the traffic.
    I guess those who want to "reach out and chew somebody's ear" are still
  around.

(GENE NESTRO) The 1st time and the only, time I tried CB on CMPSV  I
  erroneously tuned into the "gay" channel It was fun!!!

(Sysop Tony) Ha Ha Ha.... I understand there is a lot of "sex" going on over
  there.  Or a lot of talk, anyway!  Some of the handles are outrageous.

(GENE NESTRO) It was "hard core" but fun

(Sysop Tony) Well, due to lack of interest  If no one has any pressing
  questions, we might as well close this...

(Gerald G) ?

(Sysop Tony) conference early, and save you all some connect charges.  Any
  objections?

(Gerald G) ?

(Sysop Tony) Oh, OK.... ga Gerald

(Gerald G) With regard to the program PRINTR.100  I used a DWP210 printer and
  I would like to use 8 1/2 X 11 " sheets of paper Is there anyway or any
  program that will count the number of lines in a text file and let me
  continue on to the next page without losing the whole file.

(Sysop Tony) You should be able to add that to the program without too much
  trouble.  That's a good question for the message board, since we can go look
  at the program and give you an exact answer.  But in general,  somewhere in
  the program there is a statement that sends output to the printer like in
  "LPRINT A$" or something; right after that, you can add a counter line, to
  count up the lines sent, and do an automatic top of form command, or stop
  when you hit a certain number.   For example, if you want 50 lines, you
  could say L=L+1:IF L/50 = INT(L/50) THEN LPRINT(FF CHARCTER):Q$=INPUT$(1)

(Phil) Yes, there are  such printing programs in the Forum.  What you want is
  a "Wait between pages" option.  One I know of is PRN100, a very good M/L
  program And I suspect that PRTEXT, TXTFMT, QIKPRT & PRINT.100 (all DL2)
  also have that option.

(Bill H.) I use a program called  Men-u-tility  from Custom software that does
  that It asks for top- side and legnth  and spaces as many as you want at
  the bottom for the break in paper also I believe the RFU program in  the DLs
   also do that   You can cOntact Rush Caley for info on the program..

(Gerald G) Got it in my buffer, will analyze and get back either on the board
  or here next week.

(Sysop Tony) OK... ga Gene

(GENE NESTRO) If this helps, Phils suggestion of PRN100  gives the option of
  reviewing all pages before they are printed  ala pixels  on the M100 screen

(Sysop Tony) OK... any more on this topic?  Pixel plotting is very interesting...

(Gerald G) Thank you.

(Sysop Tony) I recall we have a program in the DL's that does just that, and
  nothing more.  PLOT.BA?  (DL4)  Hmmm why isn't that in DL2?  Will have to
  see about that later.

(GENE NESTRO) [ PIXMAP.BA ? ]

(Sysop Tony) Maybe.  Gotta check.  Maybe it needs to be converted for the 200.
    Phil, are you there?  (grin)  ga Bill

(Bill H.) I believe the program I was refering to is  RFU.100 in DL 7

(Sysop Tony) Could be.  As I recall, though  that program needed some
  subroutine programs also loaded or something.  Right?

(Bill H.) Don't believe so  its been some time since I use it as  it took up a
  lot of bytes and menutility uses under 2000 in ML

(Sysop Tony) I recall that RFU went through several generations, and was even
  published in P100.  We may currently have a self-contained version.  But I
  seem to recall the original did work in "modules".  If you wanted to sort,
  you had to load the sort module if you wanted to search/replace, you had to
  load that module.  the RFU program was little more than a menu program.
  Anyway any more on this fellows?

(Phil) [not from me!]

(Bill H.) negitive  good buddy   10-4

(Phil) bye-bye!

(GENE NESTRO) 77's upon your little bodies   SUL

(Bill H.) [thought that was 88s ]

(GENE NESTRO) [ maybe it was I recall 33's 77's & 88's]

(Bill H.) [ 73s & 88s] in L.A.]

(GENE NESTRO) You are rite!!!

(Bill H.) [oh my - what has this forum come to? ]  Tony  did you leave ?

(GENE NESTRO) [ lately I've been on for the full 2 hrs ]

(Sysop Tony) Looks like more CB/Ham stuff this morning, than anything else.

(GENE NESTRO) SU all later  done

(Sysop Tony) But Gene  Is it worth the 12 bucks it costs?

(GENE NESTRO) I think so  I really enjoy it...got me trapped for full $12 huh?

(Sysop Tony) Well, that's at least what it costs to be here for two hours.
  It's interesting what folks are willing to pay that to get answers to their
  questions.

(Bill H.) thats why I come in late  cause I cant leave til the funs over

(Sysop Tony) Well, since it's just us three ...

(GENE NESTRO) You guys on the west coast have to start at 9:00?

(Sysop Tony) Go home!  Save some money.  Yeah... It used to 8 am when Dave did
  it.  Terrible! most of us are also up late fielding the late Sat. night
  questions.  We tried evenings, but they didn't catch on.

(GENE NESTRO) I think I was on 1 or 2 Weds (i think)

(Sysop Tony) Could be.  I don't recall.

(GENE NESTRO) Well I'm outa here bye

(Sysop Tony) Bye Gene. See you next week.

(Sysop Tony) Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.
