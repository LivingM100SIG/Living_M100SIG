(Larry L) Is Smartt.* for use with disk drive only. I dont have one?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) tch, tch ...
   When all else fails read the instructions! SMARTT.DOC in DL 5 mentions that.
   Is cassette your only storage?? 
(Larry L) no. Actually I store files on Apple disks as text files. Only for
  archival storage. I use PCSG RAM so most files stay in Comp.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) What I meant was a "read/write" device - for RAM use, you need
  to change just two lines. Line 140 and 370 are the ones that open the file.
  In those, change "0:" to "RAM:" in the filename or change to "CAS:" for
  cassette use. BUT, be SURE to read SMARTT.DOC.
(Phil W) Works with a TDD plus operating system, does it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, methinks that Don the Zipper reported that, but it may
  have been someone else. As the documentation says, you can run it without ANY
  peripheral, but then you can't save the data and pick up where the computer
  had learned X amount. Mortimer has played over 14 thousand games,
  and Mortie 600 some six thousand.
(Phil W) Guess you are trying to answer last week's reliability question!
 I am now testing it with TDD and OS.  Will advise at end of CO.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) One thing that I've found interesting and puzzlementalizing
  is that the 600's random generator has won more games against the 600 than
  Mortimer's generator has won against him! On the 100, Dopus Maximus (the X)
  hasn't won a game in the last 10K tries or so and all is staying steady
  except Mortimer 100 keeps winning.
(Phil W) Brings to mind a statement reported on Forum from an RSCC employee
 that the 600 is upward compatible with the 100 and 200.  Gee! Maybe not!!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Har de har har!
(Sysop Tony) (Indeed!)
(Denny T) It could be that the generator in the 600 is better than the 100
 and is picking up those last few unknown games that the program hasn't learned
 yet.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just waking Mortie and Mortimer up now,,,,,
  I'll have details in a moment.
(Denny T) Check the data to see if all lines have numbers > 0
 that should tell you if all game combos have been played. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not necessary Denny. There are 1023 combos.
  Just watch "Level of play"  Dig it?
(Denny T) ah.. the documentation wasn't quite clear on that; it said something
  like "number of repeated games" or somesuch.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is partly dummy me and partly because the articles in
  "CodeWorks" magazine are copyright and NOT public domain, but the programs
  are public. Does that make sense?
(Denny T) yep. what level are you up to now?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, just got them going; Mortimer has played 18,759 games
  and the X has only won 277 attaining a "Level" of 314.
  On the 600, with 8923 games played the X has won 349 with a level of 325.
  Personally, I find that puzzling.
(Phil W) Does not seem to work quite right with TDD + OS. After running for a
 while the DATAC field has one number in it and the rest zeros.  And there is
 no write to disk after I hit Q.  But then I don't know how it works with 'munk
 since I haven't tried it that way.  Will look at code.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) All that whoever did was change "0:" to "A:" in the filenames
  and, I think, change the .ext from .TX to .DO.
(Denny T) hit D instead of Q
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And denny is correct, Q means quit and D means disk.
(Phil W) well I've done that on start. you mean hit d at end also?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup! The initial prompt even says so!!
  [Methinks fyll h'ain't read the instructions.]
(Phil W) [thot it meant as the FIRST move!]


(Algis K) Yes, I have a question about graphing on M100.
 anything to replace pen and graph paper?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) tony is the graph guy around here, but see BARCHT.100 in DL 4
  for one way. See HANOI.100 in DL 5 for another method of coding to put
  graphics where you want them.
(Sysop Tony) No No No No No... Tony AIN'T the graph expert around here.
 But graphing technique depends on what, exactly you want to do.  Do you want
 bar graphs, line graphs, or do you want to draw pictures on the screen?
(Algis K) Bar graphs OR line graphs; tried out your barchart program.
 very nice - but I want to graph twelve quantities!
(Sysop Tony) Well, you could use the same technique, but use lines instead of
 graphs.  The problem, with only 8 screen lines, would be to identify which
 line was which.  There is also a vertical bar graph somewhere that does 12,
 as a "monthly" summary type of graph.  Should be in DL4, although might not
 be.  Might be in the Tandy 200 manual.
(Algis K) I'll look for it.  What does Hanoi do? 
(Sysop Tony) Its a very nice, screen display of the game "Towers of Hanoi".
 Different sized doughnuts on pegs.  There is a story that goes along with
 it, too long to relate here.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hanoi is useless for your purposes except as a coding guide;
  perhaps you need to modify the BARCHT program in order to print out your data
  on printer and do without the screen display. Possibility.
(Sysop Tony) (That's a good ideas!)
(Algis K) I guess I could print out three or four screenfulls of BARCHRT- it
 prints nicely.
(Sysop Tony) Or you could add a few lines of code to print the data directly
 from the array, using "]" marks, or periods, or some such.


(Phil W) I am able to report success in running SMARTT with TDD, as is!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Algis, I wrote a program on the Model 4 that plotted, graphed,
  and put text in two columns on a big DMP-2100. No WAY that could have been
  viewed on screen before printing. No reason one can't print without screen
  preview.


(Denny T) Algis, there is a program..HIST** in Dl8 that gives vertical bar
 charts with variable scaling, but I'm not too sure if the graphics part
 uses M/L.  It is a histogram of instruction run time per line.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep! Use BRO HIST?? command for the three files,
 including .DOC.
(Algis K) That sounds like it might be what I need.
 Could also take the BASIC class someone recommended.


(Algis K) By the way, can we look forward to more of "Dave's Faves".
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Every time I start another DAVES.PIK file it seems that
  CompuServe jumps in with another project or I bermember a more important duty
(Denny T) [what could be more important??]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) such as the 19 indices of this past Friday!
  Working on it, but I've been saying that for two years.


(Sysop Tony) Seems from the descriptions that HIST** is a ML program that keeps
 track of a running BASIC pgm but recommends LCDPLT.101 in DL2 for plotting the
 results. I'd start by looking there.
(Algis K) Got it.  Lots of homework here, I see.
(Denny T) I think the part that is M/L is used while running the program you
 are checking the plotting is done in basic.. I think.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Seems that Algis is loaded down with investigating the 100 way
  Algis, don't forget PRETTY.100 from DL8 as a helper in looking at code.
(Algis K) Ok.  I'm looking to see if I can decipher the notes I took here
 on your recommendations. What is Pretty.100?
(Sysop Tony) (Notes?  Why not turn on printer for hardcopy?)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Algis, come back later tonight for your transcript of
  CONF87.021. PRETTY.100 gives a very well formatted "pretty" program listing.
  A super fine "LLIST" if that helps.


(Phil W) Article in today's LA Times re TDD's (as in those used by the deaf on
 telephone).  I'm curious how those differ from conventional modems plus
 computers we are using now.  Anyone know?
(Sysop Tony) 110 baud, and they use baudot code, stead of ASCII.
(Phil W) Obvious question is whether tne M100 could be interfaced (or has
 been!) to work that way; would seem like a natural.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, if someone writes a translating program to do it.
 Baudot is 5-bit, as I recall, while ASCII is 8 bit.  There will be some
 framing errors on transmission, but it may be possible.
(Gerald G) It was mentioned on a conference of the Issues Sig that a competitor
 Pc company uses a cassette interface and that the Issues dl has a program
 to make that computer compatible with the TDD,  It was also mentioned that
 Tdd uses sound for transmission (I think).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gerald, if you are an Issues regular perhaps you know
  Sysop GG and know whether she is deaf as well as blind. Also suspect there
  might very well be information on this in the Handicapped Forum where
  Sysop GG also holds forth. She, Georgia Griffith, is one of our very senior
  sysops.
(Gerald G) Georgia is remarkable since she is doing an incredible job while
 being both blind and deaf. I could mentioned the name of the computer but I do
 not want to compete with Tandy here.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good grief!
  That is NOT an issue or problem here this Forum is NOT a Tandy yes man!!
  Give, give, give! 
(Gerald G) About the computer that is compatible wth TTY and TDD?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup, some might be able to see a portable connection.
(Gerald G) I am told on a recent Wednesday night conference of Issues that
 the IBM Pc has a cassette interface or perhaps can be connected to one
 and that the Issues DL has a program to make the IBM pc compatible with
 TDD.  Only the IBM pc and not the xT or at.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Thankee Gerald. And to clarify ---- The Tandy Corporation
  neither sponsors nor supports this Forum.
(Gerald G) Thank you and I assume that they do not support the trs80 pro
 because I am afraid if I complain to much online about a certain
 computer company based in Fort Worth I may be in trouble with cis.
(Sysop Tony) Gerald, Tandy Corporation has no official connection with
 the Tandy forums on CompuServe.  We support them, they don't support us.
 You can say what you need to!  This is an open forum.


(Sysop Tony) Phil.... On second thought...
 I don't think you can receive 5-bit dat on an 8-bit UART.
 Oh... Phil's gone. Too bad.  Well forum is open for questions or comments.


(Gerald G) The m100 unit that I got is the greatest; the Model 4 has
 a loose n key, I lost modem capability, call service who came but I am
 dissatisfied that nothing was done - and a service contract did not arrive.
 Enough said. 
(Sysop Tony) Well, There is a direct chain of command for processing
 complaints. Start first with the service manager.  If he doesn't satisfy
 you, get the district service managers name, and call him.  If that doesn't
 satisfy you, call Fort Worth.  They WILL listen to your complaint, and
 solve the problem, if you go high enough.


(Gerald G) How do you get the service manager and district service managers
 name? Will any RSCC give it out.
(Sysop Tony) Well, I assume,  you have some number to call for service?
 Call it, and ask to talk to the service manager.  Ask for his name.  Ask for
 the name of the district service manager.  He must give it to you, or he's in
 deep trouble.  Tandy Service is not a principality on it's own, they must
 conform to company policy.
(Gerald G) Okay, I am going to have to take more initiative and follow this up.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) For Gerald ...
  From my observation over the past three years plus the only way you can get
  in trouble with CompuServe is obscene language, not paying your bill,
  and sending junk Email. Opinions alone will not get anyone in trouble.



(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay you teknikos. Is it possible and/or reasonable that the
  600's random generator scores better on SMARTT than the 100's because the
  clock is slower on the 600?? 
(Sysop Tony) No.  Clock speed should have no effect since the computer ain't
 watching the clock. I thought you were gonna ask about the random generator.
 The 600's is obviously better, since it can work in 16 digit.  The 100's is
 8 digit, and repeats after every 65000 numbers or so. (2^16).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Thought the clock speed affected speed of computation and
  therefore might have an affect whether the TIME$ was involved or not.
  Note that in SMARTT there is no seeding of the generator - intentionally.
(Sysop Tony) Yes and no. ... the clock speed you are talking about is really
 "instruction speed".  A certain number of instructions handled in a certain
 amount of time. The 100 handles the same instructions faster.  But the
 program's "thinking" time is still limited to the instruction speed.  Random
 number generator has a default seed, and the 600 would be playing a different
 series of games than the 100, but with relatively the same results.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, that is what is puzzlementalizing me.
  Not the same results!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmmm methinks we might as well shut down early
  and save O.T. and Gerald a nickel or two. Okay gang??
(Sysop Tony) OK.  I'll vote for that.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Then, with no objections, we'll close down
  and enjoy our February!!
  bye bye all!
