(Sysop Tony) Good Morning, Gene.

(GENE NESTRO) Hi Tony

(Sysop Tony) Are you in a Ho Ho Ho mood?

(gene) Never, I don't participate

(Sysop Tony) Oh, too bad. ... There's a Magic to Christmas.

(gene) RE:NOMENU...nice file, Tony.  Xmas is not one of my favorite times
  Split/Screen & two different conversations!!!

(Sysop Tony) Yes, nice file... I was shocked to learn that many folks  were
  not aware they could get out of the menu mode.  One of the big problems, I
  think is that a lot of folks just don't read the many help files in DL1.
  So,  I pointed to this one in the bulletin.

(gene) Well using the Set NoMenu command is difficult for  many to understand

(Sysop Tony) Or find!  Guess it's not too well documented.

(gene) I,ve been using it for sometime. I don't know where I  picked it up.

(Sysop Tony) I believe it's mentioned in the DOWNLD.HLP file.  Think Dave
  stuck it in there.  Trouble is, I seldom read those files myself.  (Unless
  someone points out that they're out of date.)

(gene) Another use that most users dont' use is the PER file area. Good for
  storing prgs. for DOS initialization.

(Sysop Tony) That's an area I haven't explored.  Personal opinion is that it's
  not an economical way to save files.  It costs money, and if you don't
  access the file for 30 days, it disappears.  Better to have it locally, on
  disk, or even cassette, than to store it here.  However, I hear that some
  business users use that area to transfer files and stuff between execs on
  the road and folks in the home office, using a common PPN.  Guess that's useful.

(gene) What do you think of an article(s) in Port 100 from this SIG

(Sysop Tony) Exactly how do you mean, "From this SIG", Gene?  ...  Before they
  stopped publishing last year, they did approach us, and ask if we could
  provide them an article each month.  No money, but exposure.  We agreed, but
  they died before we could get started.  New folks want to publicize their
  own BBS.

(gene) Port 100 is so skimpy lately. I think Phil W. would be a good start.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, I noticed the last issue was only 32 pages.  Don't know how
  Terry Kepner is going to manage to have enough info for two magazines each
  month.  Shall we see what Rush has?  ga Rush ga

(R Caley) ok...I guess you answered  I remember you asking about  our
  opinion of P 100 under CW communications when they  were going to take it
  over I warned you guys about how they screwed HOT COCO  Now it seems - I
  heard from Greg Susong- that CW dropped it after a few issues  Did Kepner
  buy it?

(Sysop Tony) Yeah... Terry Kepner will now run both PICO and P100.

(Phil) I've sorta  lost interest in both mags.  Neither Pico nor P100 really
  are very substantial anymore -- given the prices you pay for them

(R Caley) [I really liked Laptop User]

(M. Shaunnessey) hello, this is mike from chicago

(Phil) Typically they cannot answer readers questions that are old hat
  here.  Yeah -- really sorry to see LU bite the dust; had real promise, that
  one did!

(Sysop Tony) And the price was right!

(Phil) [Yes!!]

(Sysop Tony) I think the slump, when P100 stopped publishing  hurt the whole
  portable users badly.  Advertisers, too.  With no info, many folks
  gravitated to other machines, where there WAS info available.  

(Phil) And it isn't just the Model 100 mags, eiother.  There is not a good
  one covering the PC-type lappers - maybe cuz they get good coverage from
  the PC Magazine class of pubs.

(M. Shaunnessey) hi there, is anyone familier with the em8sig.200 program?

(Sysop Tony) Probably no one here this morning. Having a problem?

(M. Shaunnessey) keep getting error 83 in line 53 no matter what I enter

(Sysop Tony) Suggest you leave a message on the board, and maybe someone can
  give you an answer.  No way to look at the program right now, and give you
  any advice.  OK?

(Phil) No error 83, I think

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, but it's an undefined error.

(gene) Could be a 'Maxfiles = x' error

(Phil) Ah!

(Sysop Tony) No, that's always a BN error.

(gene) ok

(Sysop Tony) Anything else, Mike?

(M. Shaunnessey) Yes, Is Mr. Miller still around?, I tried to contact him
  through eplex.

(Sysop Tony) Probably not.  He was fighting terminal Cancer for several years,
   and was confined to a hospital.  He hasn't been here since middle of
  September.  It's an assumption, but I think he's passed away.

(M. Shaunnessey) So, I should just toss a message  into the blue for help?

(Sysop Tony) That's your best chance for help now, yes.  Address it to "All".

(M. Shaunnessey) Thank's all, I'll do that.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Now that I've got you all here  Here's my Christmas card.

 Season's Greetings

(Phil) [Nice, and tks!]

(M. Shaunnessey) Merry Christmas to you too.

(Ron) Nice tree,Tony. Looks like The WUMPUS dressed to the 9's.<grin>

(Sysop Tony) Gee, is THAT what a WUMPUS looks like! (grin)  Speaking of Wumpii
  ... (Wumpii???!)

(Ron) I hope it doesn't smell like a WUMPUS!

(Sysop Tony) (The Tree that Ate Cleveland!)

(M. Shaunnessey) I am trying to automatically download the titles from an ENS
  folder. Any ideas?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know what an ENS folder is.  Explain?

(M. Shaunnessey) Executive News service, It scans newswires for keywords and
  collects the titles in a file somewhere. Similar to a message

(Sysop Tony) Mike... type shorter lines, so we know you're still there.  I'm
  not familiar with the clipping service, although I've seen it mentioned
  several times.  I guess there's a file somewhere ...

(M. Shaunnessey) Sorry, I'm new to this.

(Sysop Tony) with your clippings in it.  Or at least the references.  Why
  not just go to the file, press your F2 button, and download the file?

(M. Shaunnessey) Can I get TELCOM to wake up at 02:00?

(Sysop Tony) Depends on what machine you have.

(M. Shaunnessey) A 200

(Sysop Tony) Yes, the 200 has a wakeup function. ... But considering  that the
  machine consumes practically no power, why not plug it into the wall and
  have your program set to operate at 2 am, or whatever time you choose?

(M. Shaunnessey) Back to EM8SIG or something like it?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, something like it.  But perhaps more specialized.  In other
  words, a customized version to do just the one thing.

(M. Shaunnessey) I've tried to modify the AUTO.YGI program in DL3 but keep
  getting I/o errors in the input statement from the modem.

(Sysop Tony) Well, you probably need something far simpler than that.  Take a
  look at the program in the file 1200BD.PGM,  which is a basic shell of how
  to sign on,  and send commands to the system, and wait for responses.
  You can tailor that to go through whatever is sent, and do your job.
  Preceed the program with a time loop, like ONTIME$ GOTO 100, which starts
  the program.

(M. Shaunnessey) 1200bd.pgm in dl3?

(Sysop Tony) Yep.

(M. Shaunnessey) Well thanks for the help, the kid wants to use the phone.

(Sysop Tony) OK, we're open for another topic. Send "Q" to ask a question or
  change the topic, Send a "C" to comment on the current topic.

(Phil) I was telling Denny of my "progress" on XMDPW5.200.  Current versions
  of the program all lock up the machine ...

(Sysop Tony) Bummmer!

(Phil) so that I have to turn off memory over night each time I try it  just
  to be able to use the 200 again.  Makes the process impossibly slow so that
  I have just about said sayonara to THAT project!

(Sysop Tony) Whew! What a job. How come you didn't buy that 200 for $350 that
  was on the board  last week as a Christmas Present to yourself?

(Phil) I don't like the 200.  Screen seems to have less contrast than the
  100 and in my work location the light just does not work out well  I have
  better angles with the tilted 100, and it just works out better for me.

(Sysop Tony) The 200 has an "anti-glare" screen that makes a difference.  And
  obviously there are a lot of differences between the 100's and 200's
  versions of TELCOM.  Looks like a major job to duplicate the same program
  for both machines.  Maybe a  "look-alike" is better than a duplication.

(Phil) Well  I've been working it both ways, adding stuff from a disassembly
  of  200 TELCOM to make the term stuff work -- and just have not gotten
  there it is doable, but not when I can only try one version in an evening!

(Sysop Tony) Have you tried different banks? Maybe you could do 2 or 3 an
  evening?  Ha!

(Phil) It locks up ALL!  And there are other good things like when it says
  download aborted, it says it over and over  scrolling up the screen.  CAnnot
  figure that... either problem is probably some stuff being used in ROM that
  is outside TELCOM  Oh well..maybe a relocatable disassembler or a 0:
  supporting mini OS would be easier!

(Sysop Tony) Heh heh... maybe it's trying to make the point! (grin) ... It
  AIN'T gonna do that! (chuckle) Right. ... Write us a new DOS. (heh heh)

(Phil) Need to get james Yi interested in XMDYI5!  [I said easier, not
  possible!]

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, but then it would come out, Y5XDMI.200.  (grin)  Well,
  anyone have something pressing to talk about?

(Sysop Tony) Denny... You've got line noise today.  ga Arnie

(Sysop Denny) [too much noise today]

(ARNIE/EX) HAS ANYONE USED THE REAL CHEAP VIDEO OUTLINED IN PORTABLE 100?..

(Sysop Tony) Not that's been reported yet.  I read the article with
  interest but haven't gotten around to doing anything with it. However,
  It's on my "To-Do" list for "One of these days".

(ARNIE/EX) Would the video suggested permit modification of text or simply
  viewing?

(Sysop Tony) Probably viewing whatever was in the LCD buffer,  which would
  mean whatever was put on the system buss. ..... One of our members did play
  with that video board, but in another application. He connected it to the
  RS-232 port, and a big-screen monitor so an entire class could see whatever
  he sent to the RS-232 port.

(ARNIE/EX) sounds like a good idea. I take my 102 to class with me all the
  time I'd like details if they exist.

(Sysop Tony) Well, there's a basic info file  in DL13, called VIDEO.100.  He
  reported success with the board on the message board.  But no further
  detailed file came from that.  Basically, you just get the board,  connect
  it between the RS-232 and the monitor,  and send whatever you want displayed
  to the RS-232 port.  No big deal.

(ARNIE/EX) is that the device called "snatcher?"

(Sysop Tony) No. .... The "snatcher" allows you to send data to two RS-232
  devices at once,  or to "monitor" a line; either incoming or outgoing, or
  both.  But the output is still 232.  It has to connect to something with a
  232 input.

(ARNIE/EX) Thanks for the info

(Sysop Tony) OK....  Good luck.  Let us know if you get it working.  Anybody
  else?  

(ARNIE/EX) will do. Has anyone used Traveling Softare's Rombank  Can it be
  used with ram expanders?

(Sysop Tony) Denny is probably most familiar with those things...  Denny?

(Sysop Denny) yes  It should be able to be used with a RAM bank, but  the
  problem wouldn't be with hardware (they use different sockets) but with
  software hooks. The ROM bank is very 'hooky' and takes over the machine
  pretty much completly. Seems that Phil tried to use it with a PG ram bank,
  Phil?

(Phil) Yes  works fine with the PG Design Banks of RAM -- though  I think it
  may turn off 0Menu on the way out; no big deal tho, just need to type 0menu
  at the main menu to get it back.

(Sysop Denny) One thing it won't work AT ALL with is the  Chipmunk disk drive.
   You have to do a cold start to get the 'Munk back  after running the ROM
  bank.  You should be able to put the Node rom in the bank and run it from
  there.

(Sysop Tony) Denny... isn't TS's ROM Bank the same as PGD's Safe?

(Sysop Denny) yep, but PG doesn't have Sardine+

(Phil) My impression is that Node is a little tougher re compatiblility  but I
  have not used it, just based on msgs on the board.

(ARNIE/EX) I thought the safe needed to attach to the system bus on the 102.

(Sysop Denny) No, you might be thinking of the Vault.

(Sysop Tony) (Gee it's getting hard to keep track of the players!)

(ARNIE/EX) thanks for the comment!

(Sysop Tony) Any more on that subject, guys?

(Sysop Denny) [nope]

(Sysop Tony) OK

(ARNIE/EX) Is there a New York area users group?  I am tired of having to
  listen to msdos and mac talk from my colleagues!

(Sysop Tony) Yes there is ...

(Ron) Yes, Arnie. NYLUG

(Sysop Tony) they make a monthly announcement on the bulletin board  of
  upcoming meetings.

(Ron) The New York Laptop User Group (NYLUG) ...

(ARNIE/EX) thanks...

(Ron) meets every month at a RSCC in midtown Manhattan. Do you want to sign
  up,Arnie?

(ARNIE/EX) Yes, if the meetings are at a reasonabletime.... I have two kids
  and a wife writing a dissertation.

(Ron) We meet at 6PM to 8PM, OK?

(ARNIE/EX) what day?

(Ron) Usually on a Wed.

(ARNIE/EX) I'd like to sign up. I'd find some difficulty  being on time. I
  teach at an LI college till five.

(Sysop Tony) (Not necessary to be "on time", just be there)  (Be there or be
  square)

(Ron) Stop in at the Radio Shack CC at 385 5th Ave.(near 36th St)  and leave
  your name and phone # with a rep. We will be meeting there on Jan 13 for our
  next meeting Lots of good people.  We're having a Christmas party tonight in
  the Village. Want to come?

(ARNIE/EX) Fine, I'll sign Thanks, but we have plans. Must go join family for
  breakfast. Thanks

(Sysop Tony) So, how many times have you watched "It's a Wonderful Life" this
  year.

(Ron) OK

(Sysop Denny) [my all time favorite movie!]

(Sysop Tony) (now we know what to get Denny for Christmas!)

(Phil) [PC desktop!]

(Sysop Tony) (Nah... a video tape with all 3 versions of the film on it)

(gene) q

(Sysop Tony) OK....  ga Gene

(gene) What was the BEEP I just got?  Who or what sent it?

(Sysop Tony) Don't know.  Maybe someone sent you a message?

(gene) the prefix was   %  ?

(Sysop Tony) Well, maybe they'll send it again.  Meantime, if no one has any
  questions, I will now sing a medly of my favorite songs... Carols, actually.

(gene) (Let's exchange passwords & ID numbers for Christmas)

(Sysop Tony) Silent Night ... Jingle Bells ... Oh Come all Ye Faithful
  ... that brings up another subject... About the recent contest.  You notice 
  that all the entrants got something?  And did you also notice that the big
  winners were decided on a matter of one vote or so?  And did you also notice
  that there were only 19 vote files (or so) counted?  Question is, was the
  contest really worth while?  And considering the small turn out, six or
  seven entrants got free access time.  Does that mean winning is almost
  "easy"? Or a "semi-sure thing".  Was it rigged?  Is there a Mafia connection?
  Does Santa sleep with his whiskers over or under the blankets? Is all this
  important???

(norm l) Topic??

(Phil) [Huh??]

(Sysop Tony) No special topic today, your choice.  ga

(norm l) Just listening!

(gene) I think the "best" prgs were alredy uploaded  & consequently a lot
  of Siggers didn't really have anything they thought were worthwhile

(Sysop Tony) That's just it.  ANYTHING won a prize!  All you had to do was
  upload something good or not, to win a prize.  And if you got five of your
  friends to vote for your upload, you could have won the grand prize!
  Somehow that doesn't seem reasonably "contesty".

(gene) Now you tell us!!!

(Phil) I agree - especially since the best programming efforts may not have
  won. I don't recall the winners, but I thought James Yi did one of  the best
  ones, and being for a 200, likely it was not highly scored.  I really think
  you need judges, not a popular vote; in fact one fellow unabashedly voted for
  his own program as the best and with a small number of votes, that could
  swing it!

(Sysop Tony) Good point.  Maybe we should "weigh" the votes, so that 200
  programs get a vote and a half for each vote, or something.  Or, as you say,
  a panel of judges.  Problem with that one, is that so few folks have both a
  100 and 200 to try out all the programs.  We're planning another contest for
  next summer, you know.

(Phil) Well, it's not whether it works or not -- it's programming quality
  that counts (grin!).  Seriously, I never did run James program, and it could
  not be converted to the M100, but from looking at the code, it was superior!

(Sysop Tony) Ah, but you're an exceptional person; A quality programmer, a
  connoisseur, and an insightful judge of programming technique.

(Phil) [make that quantity, not quality!]

(Ron) On the subject of quality programs  I just uploaded my review of
  "LCdraw" from Lonestar Software to DL13 last night.

(Sysop Tony) Oh yes.  With Xmodem protocol I see.  It's been merged into the
  DL, and noted in the New files list in the DL1 DES. Thanks.

(Ron) No problem! It was fun.

(Sysop Tony) Did you look this morning, to see how many folks had already
  downloaded it?

(Ron) No. Why?

(Sysop Tony) Just wondered.  Many authors (blush) check almost daily for a
  week or so to see how well their file has been received.  (Et tu, Phil?)

(Ron) Ah yes, ...

(Phil) [Sure do; only reason I ever log on! <grin>]

(Ron) I sent a long file to the "Scripture Studies" DL on the Reigion SIG. Mea
  Culpa!

(Sysop Tony) It's fun watching the access counter creep up.  My new file
  NOMENU.HLP had 40 by this morning... in less than 2 days.  Surprised that so
  many users are still hooked on the menus.  Forgot that ...

(gene) [I erronouesly downloaded it 5 times]

(Sysop Tony) while we say get off the menus, we didn't tell newcomers HOW.
  So are you saying the count is OFF?  Bah Humbug!

(gene) grin!!!

(Ron) Where's NOMENU.HLP?

(Sysop Tony) DL1, Ron.  Saves time, frustration and $$$$.  One of our members
  pointed out to me half the things we say to do, never show up on his menus.
  THEN I got a glimmer of understanding that the menus were confusing folks.
  I've been off them for so long, I wasn't familiar with their current form.

(Phil) [[LFUTL.PW1 has managed to creep up to 1002]

(Sysop Tony) Congrats.  That's a major file, then.  I noticed the first of the
  TDDTIP files outweighs all the rest, too.  Strange count though, on the
  spelling checker files, the accesses sort of dwindle off towards  the
  last few files.  Almost as if they get tired of downloading about half way
  through.

(Phil) It is interesting to watch the count.  The programs I really think are
  nifty (MONTOR, RECOV3) don't get much play while others do.  My tastes and
  needs are untypical, I guess!

(Sysop Tony) Yeah... some of the ones we really put time into, don't seem to be
  popular  while short little "knock off's" seem to get "hot".

(Ron) What we need is a new "Best of" by PW! (grin)

(Sysop Denny) But Phil, Your Kyo-85 stuff has been downloaded by fully 10%
  of the available machines! I think your market penetration has been very
  good there! (grin)

(Sysop Tony) Yes, maybe a few "Best of" files would be a good idea.

(Phil) True I have a monopoly!

(Sysop Tony) I note that the "Best of Model 100" book released last year is
  much out of date, as far as any "best of" list would be now.  And apparently
  no plans for an update of the book.

(Phil) Ron may have been referring to BSTPGM.PW1 in DL1  which was done fully
  four years ago! A bit out of date, alright!!

(Sysop Tony) Right.  I know. Thinking maybe we should all prep a Best of" file
  for the DL's.

(gene) You know, ...

(Phil) [good idea!]

(Sysop Tony) (BESTOF.SIG file - DL1)

(gene) it's interesting to see the differences in prg style from '83 to the
  present. (calls, peeks, pokes ets).

(Sysop Tony) Yeah.  More info has become available  on what those peeks and
  pokes do.  We're still a lot short of completely understanding these
  machines, though. 

(Sysop Denny) BESTOF.DT, BESTOF.PW, BESTOF.TA, etc.  Maybe we should take
  a poll.

(Roman Kowalczuk) breaker, breaker

(Sysop Tony) Roman, this is not CB.  If you want to ask a question, send a
  "Q" to get in the question lineup, or a "C" to comment on the current topic.
  We take turns, and you'll be called on when your turn comes up.

(Ron) The Witching Hour approaches!

(Roman) ...'Lo from Toronto. Check, Tony

(Sysop Tony) I like the best of idea.  But a poll would be like the contest
  vote files.  Inconclusive.

(Phil) RE styles of pgming: In mid 1984 I, Phil W, left a series of messages
  about machine language programming. Looking back on them now, they were
  a bad idea.  Hows that for a turnaround??

(Sysop Tony) Good thing we aren't holding you accountable for what has already
  scrolled away and been forgotten. (grin)  Re programming styles: ...

(Phil) [no archivist then!]

(Sysop Tony) I'm a utility programmer... write it so that it works,  does the
  job, and don't get fancy.

(Phil) [amen!]

(gene) July 2, 1984, ...

(Sysop Tony) [Gad! He's got all the old messages on paper!]

(Phil) [Oh oh!]

(gene) I d/l a program called "Program Via Menu". Does any one  remember whose
  it was ?

(Sysop Tony) (Whew!)

(Phil) [safe!]  No

(gene) I thought it was the best thing I ever saw

(Sysop Tony) Do you remember the exact file name? "Program Via menu" dont
  sound like anything of ours.

(Phil) [what did it do?]

(gene) Tony Anderson 70506,1261  sig100 xa4  Hows that!!!

(Phil) [Teehee!!!!]

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, but "Program Via menu" still doesn't ring a bell.

(gene) It is a call etc to make sch, telcom, ets visible or invisable

(Ron) Ding-a-ling!(grin)

(Sysop Tony) Ah!  CALLS.MNU.  To make unused programs invisible.  Yeah, I
  never use SCHDL or ADDRSS, so don't have them on my menu.

(gene) remember XA4  ETC

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, a while back... Well, we're running overtime here...
  I'm having a White Christmas up here. Neat experience for a So. Calif. kid.
  So Season's Greetings and best wishes to all of you how ever you celebrate
  the season.  We've run out time this week, so just let me say, A Merry
  Christmas to All, and to All, a Good Night.

     ***  END OF CONFERENCE  ***

(gene) cu Phil, Denny, Tony and all

(Sysop Tony) See you all again.   Bye.

(Sysop Denny) [Bye guys, Merry Xmas.
