(RossR) I have dissasembled M100 ROM to a DBase II database and written a
 command file that lets me search for the dissasembled code on any key phrase
 or descriptor of the funcion of the routine. I have learned a great deal from
 it and wonder if ..
 1.It would be legal to upload such a thing...
 2. Would anybody find it useful 
(Sysop Tony) 2. Lots of folks would find it useful...
 1. Probably problems in making the info public though it is readily obtained.
 Tandy (as well as others) take strange positions regarding public distribution
 of code.
(John R) Tandy wouldn't like it! If you check the Software License in the
 "Limited Warranty" you will find the sentence "Customer is expressly
 prohibited from disassembling the Software." 
(RossR) Was afraid of that thanx all 
(rowlfe) [does it REALLY say that???]
(John R) [Yep IV D]  [page i of 100 manual]
(rowlfe) [found it, but what happens if you aren't the original owner?]

(John R) Back to copyrights and warranties. You can always sell your original
 copy of software, unless specificially forbidden by a license agreement,
 but the copyright laws and license agreements apply to the new owner as well.
 Obviously, Tandy can't find out if you disassembled part of the ROM for your
 own use, but I am sure that they would object if the disassembly were to be
 found in a SIG that they sponser!

(Sysop Tony) Speaking of Copyrights. CompuServe has finally placed a file on
 the subject online. Read it by typing GO RULES.

(rowlfe) on the license agreement in the book; IV F seems to say t me that I
 cannot sell my M100 unless I buy another copy, since it has the software
 inside. I realize it can't really mean what I think it does or Tandy could sue
 anyone for selling thier copy of software without buying another. comments?
(John R) Your original purchase of the 100 included the ROM software. In the
 US, you can always resell whatever you purchased, provided that you didn't
 make any copies beyond the original except for back-up copies in the case of
 software. Any back-up copies would have to be given to the buyer or destroyed
 when you sold your system.
(rowlfe) re-reading the paragraph  indicates my snap judgement was wrong.
 in order to sell, you must have bought one copy initially, so I guess I can
 sell if I want to anyway.
 whew! thought I'd seen something to challenge tandy on.

(John R) What is the official release date for the 600 BASIC ROM and is it
 confirmed that the various string commands will not be in the released
 product?
(Sysop Tony) Well there was at least one report that it was delivered on
 Friday. And yes, it is confirmed. The BASIC for the 600 does not have certain
 commands, including PEEK, POKE, INSTR SPACE$() and STRING$().
(John R) Does it have MID$ and the other string-manipulation instructions?
(Sysop Tony) Yes, it has those....
(rowlfe) [varptr?]
(Sysop Tony) Dave says it is more akin to the [Tandy] 1000 BASIC than the
 100/200 BASIC. I'll check, Rowlfe... meanwhile, any more John? 
(Sysop Tony) No, no VARPTR.
(Ed G.) [VARPTR with no PEEK seems useless]
(Sysop Tony) (Ed, No VARPTR, No PEEK)

(Larry L) 1) is there any way to define the unused function keys in telcom?
 2) has anyone seen the jan issue of 100/200? 
(Sysop Tony) 1. In which computer do you want to redefine keys...
 and the magazine Portable 100/200/600 is published the LAST week of the month.
 So no one has seen it yet.
 Redefining function keys involved writing machine language patches. Those
 we've seen so far, do not give you a label line display of the command word.

(RossR) Does any one have a clue as to why Tandy placed the previosly listed
 constraints on its M600 Basic?
(Sysop Tony) You know that Tandy makes no such public announcements or
 apologies. Tana, do you have any comment? Does Tandy have any official comment
 on the differences in 600 BASIC?
(tana) officially? No.
(rowlfe) [howzabout unofficially?]
(tana) Unofficially, not being a programmer I can't say too much. However,
 in conversations with software eng the 600 BASIC set up should lend itself to
 easier manipulation as it allows the use of library files to perform various
 functions. I don't know exactly what that all means, but the gist is that
 users will be pleased. Obviously...Tony and Dave are not that impressed.
 That's about it. 
(Sysop Tony) The library functions Tana is referencing are a group of 28
 subroutines or ROM calls that can be accessed by a CALL statement from
 BASIC. Neither Dave nor I have used them much yet. They may be powerful,
 but require that they be loaded into RAM to use.
(John R) 2. .^Dave^. called me on the phone about those Database calls.
 It seems that they provide access to a complete database system, probably the
 same as with FILE so that a user program can access records without worrying
 about the internal details of retrieving them. They seem quite powerful but,
 of course, we will have to wait until someone is able to exploit them.
(Sysop Tony) John, Tandy 200 has only 1 unused function key; Model 100 has 2.
 It'll take someone better than me to find out how to use the library calls.
(John R) F6 is used with the WAIT indication on the 100. 
 Doesn't mean it can't be used...
 In fact, it is in at least two programs in the database.  ...

(rowlfe) on the 600, and "user friendly" devices in general; the gossip at my
 local rscc is that the 600 basic with no user access to the operating system
 may have been a result of the complaints of 100/200 users who bought machine
 code software and it caused a cold start. The one guy I talk to seems to feel
 that in this case, at least it is a case of "user friendly = programmer
 hostile" but that the 600 will still sell quite well for those who have the
 need for the built it functions.
(Sysop Tony) Probably rumor. But a plausable one. The only folks who know are
 Microsoft and Tandy and they aren't talking.
(rowlfe) he did stress that it MAY have been a result.
(Sysop Tony) But, it's generally conceded to be a computer pointed towards the
 business market for folks who don't know, need, want, or understand
 programming.
(rowlfe) too true. done.

(Larry R.) ^Dave^. left me a message about leaving a checksum when I upload
 a program and referred me to UPLOAD.HLP in DL0.  It, too, mentions this. What
 is a checksum and how do I find out what it is? 
(Sysop Tony) The "checksum" is a computed figure, based on adding up the ASCII
 values of all the characters in your file. It is given to you by running the
 program DOWNCK.WM3 from DL4 or CHKSUM.200 from DL4. The program gives you a
 number, which may be verified by folks who subsequently download the program.

(:Lan:) Can anyone tell me the range of ASCII values which CIS will accept??
(Sysop Tony) Yes. From 0 to 255.  With reservations depending on how your
 Profile parameters are set. What do you need to know specifically?
(:Lan:) I was wondering if I were to send some ginchy little message to some
 other M100/T200 user which depended on the built-in graphics, would it go?
(Sysop Tony) Yes and no. depends on how you send it. Messages, no. But if you
 uploaded a file with 8-bit parameters, and using Xmodem, yes. In general text
 mode, the CIS software filters out almost all control characters in the 0-31
 range and subtracts the high-bit from 8-bit characters, automatically
 converting them to 7-bit. You can't get very fancy with that.

(Rich H.) Does anyone now of a screen dump for the model 200, or is anyone
 working on one?
(Sysop Tony) There is none in the database, But ther is one available
 commercially for $14.95. See ads in Portable 100/200/600 magazine from
 Portable BASICS, Jim Irwin's company.
(Rich H.) Thanks, I've been trying to find a copy of Port 100 for 1.5 months,
 and having no luck 
(Sysop Tony) It's no longer on the newsstands. You can get it by subscription.
 (giggle)....
 or sometimes in Waldon Bookstores and at B.Dalton Bookstores.
(Rich H.) I've tried all bookstores, have sent in subscric., waiting on first
 issue 
(Sysop Tony) Well, all I can say is Good Luck...
(rowlfe) [stand by for a LOOOONNNNGGGGGG wait! snicker!]

(Larry R.) As a Scottish/French friend of mine would say: Bonnie Chance.
 Does anyone here have Interactive Solutions? I've uploaded a program to
 combine some functions; some of which are related to use of that chip and
 welcome any comments from anybody who tries to use it. it works here!
(Sysop Tony) Comments usually come on message board. But generally, and from
 2 years of experience, you'll only hear if it DOESN'T work.
 Very few strokes here.
(Larry R.) 'cept keystrokes???
(Maddi) [Shame]
(Sysop Tony) Does anyone want to make a comment on Interactive Solutions
 or Larry's program?
(Larry R.) I've had that sucker freeze up on me when using DM portion to make
 phone calls and when I free it up it has created its own file named...
 get this... .CO.  What has been your experiences with this phenomenom?
(Sysop Tony) Since no one has the IS ROM, I would venture to say no one has had
 ANY experiences with this phenomenae. And no one seems anxious to jump in on
 this.
(Larry R.) I've also had the machine screen go blank when using telcom/adrs
 to make calls. I thought maybe modem program might be part of problem??? 
 Also, can special CO's be set up here at other times, for example,
 one to  discuss IS ROM?
(Sysop Tony) More likely to be case of pilot error. Expecting the computer to
 do something it can't, then doing something it shouldn't.
 The CO channel is open 24 hours a day. You can set up a CO anytime you like.
 Invite as many folks as you like, to discuss any subject.
 Sysops will attend if available for support purposes.

(JOHN S.) I was going to ask where to sub port1-2-6, but how long a wait?
(Sysop Tony) The subsctiption info is in the file MAG.100 in DL6.
 Generally 6-8 weeks before you get first issue IF you get first issue.
 Another firm handles their subscriptions, and lots of folks have problems with
 them. (They ARE getting better!)
(JOHN S.) oh, well I like to gamble a bit tnx

(Paul S) Whats a good assembler for new M100 user experienced Z80?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) All that I could do is refer him to the assemblers in DL 4,
  including TUTOR? series and the three assemblers advertised in DL 6 (oops!
  "described", not "advertised"). Probably the best is ROM2.PRD but I don't
  know for sure.
  John R, you are the only professional Model 100 programmer here, what
  assembler comments do you have for Paul??? 
(John R) Well, Polar Engineering's ROM seems to be the most useful since it
 combines debugging capabilities with the assembler and does not occupy the RAM
 of the others. I have no personal experience, however, with any of them. There
 was even an assembler in Port 100.
(Paul S) Price tag of Polar, John?
(Sysop Tony) $85

(john k) I have "call waiting"; when a call comes in I get disconnected etc.
(Sysop Tony) See the file PHNTIP.002 in DL1.
(John R) The only sure way of using your computer and still having a voice line
 available is by having a second phone line, which cost$$$. In some areas,
 there are ways of disabling call waiting. Check with your local phone co.

(>Joe B.<) am I out of order to ask if anyone knows if U-Rom II is out yet?
(Sysop Tony) The announced promised date for shipment for the Ultimate ROM
 is Jan. 29th. Anyone who has one now is a beta tester and has been very quiet
 about it.
(>Joe B.<) Ihave UROM I and don't see how they could make it much better!!
(Sysop Tony) Well, there is an ad in the January issue of PICO that indicates
 they have also included a TDD program in the ROM.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [tongue in cheek]
  "Ultimate" is defined as the last, beyond which it is impossible to go.
  Therefore, "Ultimate II" is impossible.
(Sysop Tony) Good Point....
(John R) [Penultimate?]

(jsol) Ultimate ROM???
(Sysop Tony) The Ultimate ROM for the Model 100 or 200. It's the marketing name
 of an optional ROM package for the 100 or 200, that adds several programs to
 the computer.
(jsol) Yes which kinds of progs. does it add?
(>Joe B.<) I'm fascinated by the Twrit2.ts program. It lets you format text
 like I never knew possible in a laptop! It's the most impressive feature,
 I think in UROM.
(Sysop Tony) It combines a new word processor/text formatter, an outline
 program, and a utility program that lets you display 60 characters on the
 screen instead of 40.
(jsol) That's my major interest. Compatible with TDD?
(Sysop Tony) Nothing is compatible with the TDD in the sense that it all works
 together without problems. You have to take certain precautions whenever using
 more than one machine language program in the computer.

(Paul S) Do you stick UROMs etc, in place of original or in addition to it?
(Sysop Tony) There is a little trap door in the bottom of the computer with a
 special socket for optional ROM's to be inserted they take up no memory, and
 add whatever programs are in the ROM to those you already have in the
 computer.

(Sysop Tony) OK folks... our allotted time is up..
 So this CO is called to a halt...
 You can all stick around and chat as long as you like....
 Stay! Enjoy!
 All go to Yak-Yak mode...
