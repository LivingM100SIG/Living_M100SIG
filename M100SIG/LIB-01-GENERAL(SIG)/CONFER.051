(LARRY L) just wondering...do most m100 owners have another computer
 (apple IBM) or just the m100?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) via other media I discovered that a very large percentage of
  Model 100 owners also have desk tops of one type or another. I'd expected
  that Model 100 owners had only the 100. Very, very wrong.

(Sysop Tony) Has anyone noticed that Larry is frequently the first one in CO
 And is often the first one with a question???  Congratulations, Larry.
 You get the silver medal of persistence.
(DaveW.) [How can we if he's first.]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, Larry lands on landing place in the land manner.
(LARRY L) thanks dave. yes ,i am always early for appointments too. I just hope
 i'm not too oppressive to the rest of you, but I love this little computer and
 this forum.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Larry, I can really appreciate what you mean. A lot of folks
  don't realize that the Model 100 was my first large computer ever. From
  Aug-83 to Dec-84 Mortimer 100 and I did the sysoping here with no other
  supporting peripherals except for the printer. It is quite a machine!


(Jay M.) My 100 is growing lots of things. I just bought a DVI and a Lucid ROM
 at my local RSCC for $225 together. What do I need to do to make the DVI live
 with my TDD?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony? Do the TDD files cover that?
(Sysop Tony) No, not yet. Woods Martin has made a few comments on the message
 board, but the information is mostly usable to DVI users who have the
 machines so as to follow the information.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jay, t'would seem that prior using DVI you should remove TDD
  software and vice versa. Maybe FLIPML files from DL 4 are what you need.
(Jay M.) yeah...I'll trap Woods in the message base and ask him too, as well as
 making another stab at getting FLIPML working.


(CURTIS MOHOMMED) is it just as easy to save and load ml prog to tdd as .ba?
(Sysop Tony) Yes and no. If you are using FLOPPY.CO, yes. You just specify the
 name as it appears on the menu. But the .CO program MUST be on the main menu.
 With the alternate operating systems such as POWR-DISK and TS-DOS, it's more
 cumbersome, if possible at all.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That's a surprise!
(Jay M.) My experience is with POWR-Disk but it it possible to save and load ML
 programs, both from a .CO file and from its location in high memory. It's just
 a little more trouble unless you have one of the menu programs available here
 in DL 5 (I think) PDMENU.100 and MENUJR.100.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Good old Eutie Chipmunk, good old Mortie 600]


(SHAH SHARIF) Have 500 to spend on m100. where do i start to upgrade?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) in my opinion, you couldn't go wrong by getting the Chipmunk.
  However, for your particular needs you may prefer SoundSight's Bubble or one
  of the RAM expansion upgrades instead or, or in addition to, the Chipmunk.
  With that to spend, I do not recommend the Tandy drive. See CHIPMK.PRD,
  EXPAND.RAM files in the DL 6 as well as BUBBLE.PRD.
(SHAH SHARIF) how about the A&J wafer drive
(Sysop .^Dave^.) NOT the A&J unless you just want to store a little bit and
  don't need to read/write and don't care about software support for the drive
  The A&J is better than a Cassette recorder. Period.
(LARRY L) the pcsg ad does say price is 600..did they drop the price.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) the Chipmunk has been dropped in price.
(Sysop Tony) $399
(Mike A.) $399
(Rich W.) Just to say I hgave an A&J and I thinbk its great. Reliable & fast,
 but Dave is right about read/write limit. Also, can't save .ct,.ca files.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rich, "fast" compared to cassette. Not to Chipmunk. If'n ya
 had $500 to spend would you opt for A&J Rich?
(Rich W.) no. I'd get PCSG 128 & software, AJ after that, unless need
 read/write.


(Steve Z) X-TEL's new version works great with the T200/Chipmunk just got mine
 two days ago.  I'd say to go with the Chipmunk unless you MUST have a single
 item to carry because no matter how much memory you have it WILL fill up.
 256K on my ZP and I'm still pushing RAM limits.
 Q for Mike A... what's newest ROM version for T200 Chip?
(Mike A.) Ya got me there...3.45 I think.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) glad to hear you report on X-TEL since Sigea doesn't have a
  Chipmunk!! They telecommed the new file to me directly and I beta tested for
  them.
(Steve Z) Yes, on X-TEL - to load it I had to delete the copyright line and
 shorten all the error messages because with 14376 bytes free with CDOS
 loaded and X-TEL.DO running over 8K, there wasn't enuf room for X-TEL.CO &
 X-TEL.BA (the end result files).
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Never was impressed with Tandy 200]


(ROBI) I've been BRO'ing the DLs (at 1/6 my normal CIS price). I noticed that
 most MUNK stuff was CDOS 3.24 specific. What do I get with the latest CDOS?
 and is there a feeling as to how well it works with 3.24 stuff?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) the bulk (by far) of folks have 3.24 (or 1.8 or 2.5 or 3.1)
  and there was a hiatus due to a faulty 3.41 and such. Tim Ekdom is the real
  guru on programming for the Chipmunk here on the board but don't know what
  status of upgrades currently is.
(Mike A.) The bundled software takes care of most folks needs, specifically
 Telcom. CO which lets you download direct to disk,
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [CRASH!]
(Mike A.) Pbase, a database manager for BIG files, Copy, backup, etc.
 the stuff in dl5 is getting outdated, because many of the CDOS problems have
 disappeared and 3.45 is, reportedly, the LAST word in DOS'es.
 (famous last words.)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, the [CRASH!] referred to the original, awful TELCOM.CO;
  has that been fixed?
(Mike A.) Most definitely!
(Sysop Tony) (What version?)
(Mike A.) 1.4
(Denny T) I have version 1.4 of Telcom. It crashes just like every other ver
(ROBI) What CDOS, Denny?
(Denny T) 3.24
(Mike A.) Was going to say you need 3.45 AND the 1.4 version of the software
 and, there's always the need to turn off Telcom. CO when finished using it.
 otherwise, it'll definitely crash just about anything else.


(Rich W.) I have started using AA Nicads in my m100 and heard that its possible
 to rewrite so that they can recharge internally with AC adapter.
(JeffG) [need 47-ohm resistor]
(Sysop Tony) (Not necessarily)
(Rich W.) is there a DL file on that
(Sysop Tony) The file you seek is RECHRG.100 in DL4. Many folks have made the
 conversions, and have found it to their liking.  However, I've also heard of
 some who've gone back to the regular AA cells due to lack of operationg time.
 Depends on your usage I guess.


(Rich W.) A friend of mine would LOVE to get an M100 used [cheap].
 is there a market? Where?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) At least twice a week read the message board here with the
  command: RS;S;SALE;N and you can pick up on whatever is being offered for
  sale.


(JeffG) What is the difference between the $499 and $399 versions of the
 Chipmunk disk?  Anyone know? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The [former] $399 version is going out of supply and will not
  be continued. It doesn't have battery pack.
(Mike A.) the price change took effect just last Thursday and involved dropping
 the a.c. only unit for 399, BUT lowered the price of the regular NiCad battery
 Chipmunk to 399.
(Sysop Tony) As I understand it, there is now only one model available, and
 it's $399.
(Mike A.) exactly!


(David K.) Had just a couple of questions concerning the bubble memory.
 What would be my best source of info both on and off line for helping decide
 whether this is for me?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jon L. Olson 75046,2325 is a devoted Bubbleer and there is the
  BUBBLE.PRD file in DL 6.
(Denny T) [Soundstream 213-463-1519]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [SoundSight]
(David K.) Does it have limited banks like the pcsg version?  32k at a time?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Can't be "like PCSG" since pcsg doesn't have a Bubble. Have to
  check with SS or Jon for latest poop.
(David K.) Right.  What I meant was: PCSG chip with 96k expansion.


(PhilW.) Question re Chipmunk compatibility with PG Designs 64K RAM:
 Is anyone using the two together?  What about cable compatibility? Et Cetera!
(Sysop Tony) I don't have the PG expansion but it has a different type of plug
 for external devices and a short adapter cable that connects to the Chipmunk
 cable outside of the computer.  Reportedly it is a stronger pin plug to
 accomodate repeated removal of the cable.
(PhilW.) No adapter cable comes with the RAM.  A separate buy?
(Sysop Tony) Yes, I guess so.... it's listed at $15 or so.
(Steve Z) sounds like you'd end up like a T200 Chipmunk; bareboard hanging out
 at end of cable.
(PhilW.) Is that a problem, Steve?  You have bad experiences?
(Steve Z) no problems, so far, just unsightly.  If i spilled coffee on it,
 tho who knows what problems could develop.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) While you're there Steve, you plan to be at LAUGHing on
  17-May?
(Steve Z) absolutely. and will get count from SD group this Wed for Denny.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good O!!
(Sysop Tony) (That's it!  THAT'S IT!!! We're gonna have a "LAUGH-IN"!!!)


(Denny T) I saw a message to Tony from Larry Holmes. Tony, you know what to
 make of this new product?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Methinks Larry being coy.]
(Sysop Tony) I have a little more information than was on the board and Yes,
 Larry is interested in developing some new Model 100 and T200 products.
 The expanded 200 RAM seems a good place to start.  Although there may be some
 other new stuff down the road.


(bob h) anyone heard of plans for a CD rom for use with the 100
(Sysop Tony) Not CD ROM, but there is the possiblity of a hard disk.
 One is being made for the Commodore computers which is "intelligent"...
(Steve Z) <grin>
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [wazza "CD ROM"]
(Sysop Tony) as the TDD is, with it's own OS.  It may be able to be ported over
 for the Tandy machines, since it uses similar technology, through the RS-232
 port.
(PhilW.) [a 19200 baud hard disk?]
(bob h) CD ROM is compact disk ROM
(Sysop Tony) (I don't know the speed, Phil)
(PhilW.) [max rs-232 = 19200 on M100]
(Steve Z) see this months issue of BYTE for overview on optical mass storage;
 also, 3 1/2 inch hard disk (10 meg) now exists -  put it in a Chipmunk?


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Steve - One reason I wanted your feed back on DBASES.600 is
  that ten days after finishing the first version I suddenly realized that it
  is superior to DATA/SORT from PCSG, T-Base from Traveling, and pbase from
  PCSG in every respect but one. Kinda bowled me over, so I'm interested in
  other reactions.
(Steve Z) So far, Dave, I've just tried it out with the sample files; works
 great with them.  My ZP is full of Plan worksheets (end of month reports).
 so in the coming week I'll work with DBASES some, create some new files,
 and keep you posted as to how things go.  So far, very impressive.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Steve, keep forgetting you don't have a disk drive with
  your ZP. Awful!
(PhilW.) Just wanted to ask Steve how he handles mass storage with the zp-150.
 mighty attractive machine except for that issue
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Maybe he uploads to his Tandy 200 !!
  tee hee
(Steve Z) As a matter of fact, until I can get cable sorted out to my
 TI desktop, I either save to cassette or upload to Tandy 200 Chipmunk, then
 (if needed) from there to TI.  Cumbersom, but with 256K I mostly keep in RAM
 what I'm working on, so storage is mostly files I no longer actively need.
(Sysop Tony) Larry Holmes mentioned he has a working prototype of an external
 disk drive for the 600...
(Steve Z) <WANNA!!!>
(Sysop Tony) maybe something will come along for your Zipper.  Does it have
 an external buss connector?
(Steve Z) Yes, it does have a system bus on the back.  It also has RS-232,
 and I'm going to try to interface TDD with it REAL SOON NOW.
(Sysop Tony) Why doesn't someone simply monitor the TDD/M100 line and get us a
 byte by byte list of the TDD commands so the TDD can be driven by ANY
 computer?
(Jay M.) Actually, all that would be needed to get the info on talking to the
 TDD is a source listing of DSKMGR.
(Sysop Tony) It's there!
(Jay M.) where?
(Sysop Tony) In DL5.


(Jim S.) What's a ZP 150? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) that is the Heath/Zenith portable that is semi-compatible with
  the Tandy 600 but is cassette instead of disk and has a slightly different
  [better] version of GW Basic.


(Jim S.) Is there any ETA for the 200 RAM Exp from PG?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) as I understand it,  It is SUD
  Sorry about that.
  [Still Under Development.]
(Sysop Tony) Last January was mentioned, But the product hasn't really been
 announced yet.
(Steve Z) Tony Wong at American Cryptonics mentioned a 64 k expansion for the
 T200.  Apparently developed for PCSG but no software yet. oh, well, still
 waiting.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony could be wong too ....
(Steve Z) <grin>
(Sysop Tony) (snicker!)
(Denny T) [Gag]
(Jim S.) [ahem]


(Jeff S (Canadian)) you know that the 600 will not be released in Canada?
(Sysop Tony) Yes
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup, there was some mention of it back when first announced.
  Highly business oriented machine, which is why so much time was spent on
  DBASES.600 by the author.
(Jeff S (Canadian)) Does anyone know then what is next on RS's portable line?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jeff, Ed Juge has said that there is no portable on the
  drawing boards.
(Jeff S (Canadian)) I had heard that RS was planning an "IBM compatible"
 portable.
(Steve Z) <gag>
(Jeff S (Canadian)) That was from a dealer.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) What did he deal in?
(Jeff S (Canadian)) I'd rather have the 600. RS plus manager.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rumour mongers deal in all sorts of guesses.
(Jeff S (Canadian)) I sort of thought so.
(John Butler) Does IBM compatability matter?
(Jeff S (Canadian)) I don't care!
(John Butler) We depend on third party software,anyway
(Steve Z) <only to IBM>
(Jim S.) IBM comp, well I write stuff for attorneys and accountants, sooo ...
 THEY seem to need it
(Steve Z) I picked ZP over 600 due to built-in basic, lighter weight, & AA
 cells. To me, IBM comp. needs be data file compatability only. I don't want to
 have to load pgms from disk to use them every time.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, the time has come the wumpus said ...
  Many thanks to all ...
  Heaviest attendance in some time ...
  Taxes must be settled.
  End of Conference ...
  All go to Yak-yak mode ...
