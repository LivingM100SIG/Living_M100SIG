
(Sysop Tony) Good Morning

(David K.) well, g' mornin, tony  was wundrin if you could hear me or what
  been trying to sen msg for the last 5 min!

(Sysop Tony) I just got here.

(David K.) how do you happen to occupy two diff job#'s at once?

(Sysop Tony) I'm a sysop.

(David K.) o.i.c.  q

(Sysop Tony) Well let's get started, folks.  No special Topic for today: Your
  choice. (Check new commands available here with /HELP command.)

(Bill T.) CIS is now publishing "Best of...M100 programs  will this be updated
  periodically?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know... it's an in-house project.  We are one of four or
  five that were selected for the start of the project.  We'll see.

(Bill T.) ok...all I wondered.. TNX

(David K.) o.k....two brief ones, tony  1) about 2 hrs ago i logged on here
  and i was presented with the visitors menu and i know i was a member.  have
  the membership files been purged recently or what?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know of any activity of the membership files,
  but that isn't to say there wasn't any.  Sorry for the inconvenience, but
  signing up again only takes a minute.  Glad you're here.  What else?

(David K.) is there any way to access dl14 the private for sale dl?

(Sysop Tony) There's nothing there.  We are not archiving For
  Sale messages, so it's not being used.

(David K.) i see.  thankee, tony

(rich w.) I have  a few questions. First a friend has the 100k drive and RS's
  exec calender he says that they don't co-exist (2 .co programs)  is there any
  way to keep another .co going without losing use of floppy.co?

(Sysop Tony) The trouble with most machine language programs  is that they
  want to operate in the same RAM space.  It's just how they're written.
  Every programmer assumes his is going to be the only CO program you'll ever
  need.  (grin) The only way you can handle such conflicts is to be real
  careful in how you  CLEAR RAM space before using each one, or to use a ML
  program manager such as FLIPML from our DL7, or one that comes from
  Acroatix.

(rich w.) ok..I'll look into dl7  next question  I heard rumour that p100 is
  being revived. True?

(Sysop Tony) Unknown.  No evidence of it.

(rich w.) last question: the new dl sewtup has me a bit confused.  what do I
  read to get a summary of where things are and what file keeps latest new
  uploads listed?

(Sysop Tony) Unfortunately, X9 is no longer available.  We had to move that
  stuff somewhere that it could be accessed readily.  The only place we could
  find, was one of the DL descriptions.  So we put it in DL1.  Get to it by
  going to DL1, then type DES.

(Rush C.) re: .co files  Some programmers are courteous enough  to give
  the addresses and make their programs re-locatable.  I have had up to 3 .co
  files running at the same time  unfortunately, R/S does not provide  for
  this in its programs.

(Sysop Tony) Well, of course, that's true.  but unfortunately, not enough
  programmers think of such niceties.

(O.T.NEW) IS CHIPMUCK STILL CHAMP IN STORAGE?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  The new TDD-2 will take 200K, in two banks of 100K each,
  But Chipmunk is still at 356K for the Model 100.   It's flakey, for the
  Tandy 200.

(O.T.NEW) THANKS

(Larry L) yes  Is the cable/connector setup of the chipmunk
  the kind that you would want to  keep connected or is it rugged enuf  to
  disconnect...(I've never seen one).

(Sysop Tony) There is a header board that plugs into the system buss and the
  cable plugs into that.  The header board can stay in the computer at all
  times, and you can remove the cable at will.  However, it's not the easiest
  thing in the world to do; the header board is down inside the compartment.

(Larry L) Thanks..

(Bill T.) two questions::
  <1> What is the "System Bus"" on the back of my M200 --  nothing in the
  owner's manual about it.

(Sysop Tony) It's a plug on the back panel  of the computer.  Near the RS-232
  port.

(Bill T.) what does it do

(Sysop Tony) It provides access to the system buss.  All the little computer
  signals that are zooming around  from one place to another.

(Bill T.) I think I need to do some reading  about that... I don't
  understand Can you refere me to something???

(Sysop Tony) Well...  details about system busses and such are rather technical.
   You don't really have to understand all that  in order to make your
  computer work.  But if you want that info you'll probably only find
  "generic" system buss info around.  There is very little detail about how
  the Model 200 system buss works, none published, that I know of.

(Bill T.) ok...tnx...mostly I would like to know if that little port
  <<previously unknown to me>>  could be of any use to me -- a low-life,
  limited use consumer...end of Q-1.

(Sysop Tony) Well, There was an article in last September's 80-micro,  that
  showed how to use the port to build a second RS-232 port.  but aside from
  that, very little.  The system buss provides  access to the computer, by
  external devices.  OK?  Any more?

(Bill T.) that's all on that one. tn x... do we wait for comments before the
  second Q??ga

(Sysop Tony) Yes. But I didn't see any.  So on to the next question.

(Bill T.) ok...Q-2: I have a TDD, and I appended a file directly and accidently
  made it too large to load it back into RAM for any changes.  Any ideas
  <besides printing and reentering> on how I can get the file at least
  partially  back into RAM to work on it???

(Sysop Tony) There is a program in DL9 called DIVVY.TDD  which can "divvy up"
  the file so you can get to it again.  See the instructions in DIVVY.DOC.
  OK?  Any more?

(Bill T.) Nope!! My joy is now complete!!! TNX...out

(Sysop Tony) OK.... ga Rush

(Rush C.) Quickie question on the M100 Clone  that goes for $150.00. I read
  the PICO article and would like  your exPERT opinion...  Is this
  a better choice than getting a M102 for more $$$ ??

(Sysop Tony) Most of what we know is in the file KYO85.INF in DL13.  I'm not
  in favor of getting a machine with serious limitations to start with, but
  some folks will find it all they ever need.  There may be program problems
  with it, however, it's not totally compatible with the Model 100 family.
  For 150 bucks, it's 16K.  To upgrade to 32K costs another $50,  So you have
  $200 in a basic machine.   I'd prefer a 32K Model 100. ... even used.  But
  if  you can deal with no modem,  and limited program availability, then it
  might be for you.

(Rush C.) ok gotta run... thanks.

(JEFF W) I AM WONDERING WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGES OF A DOS SUCH AS TDOS
  FOR THE PORTABLE DISK DRIVE  WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF ,SAY TDOS

(Sysop Tony) Well, It's a much more flexible DOS than FLOPPY.CO,  which is
  basically a file manager, allowing you  only to save and load complete files.
  The alternate DOS's, of which TS-DOS is one, allow you direct access to disk
  files from BASIC programs.  So you can read and write data to disk files.
  There is an "overview" file describing the differences in DL13. DISKOS.INF is
  the name.

(JEFF W) THANK YOU, I WAS TOLD SOME BAD INFO BY A RS SALESMAN

(Sysop Tony) Sorry about that.  Can you use lower case letters?  It looks like
  you're shouting.   Any more?

(JEFF W) No More, thank you.

(Sysop Tony) Thanks.

(PETER JABLOW) a question on Sardine..  the review said that the ur-2 should be
  exchanged. anymore detail on why?

(Sysop Tony) The new version has a routine that can be used to access SARDINE
  from the menu which the old one doesn't.  Seems like it would be a nice
  addition for only $20.

(PETER JABLOW) How does ts handle the exchange?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know exactly.  I imagine you send them your old one with
  $20 and they send you a new one.  But you'll have to check with them for
  definitive info.  At one time, they allowed you to charge it on your card,
   then credited you when the old one came back.

(Bill T.) yup  I had a similar question  and called the TS people the day
  SARDINE came out in the literature In summary, they told me that  there were
  two versions I could use: (1) I could get SARDINE on a disk, which needs a
  new chip (which has a disk hook), or (2) I could get SARDINE on a chip!!
  This kinda surprised me, since the TS software takes up the  only plug
  available. To my surprise, the salesman/technician told me  that you have to
  physicallly take out the UR-2 chip and insert the SARDINE chip whenever you
  want to use SARDINE!!!

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh... that's right.

(Bill T.) what a shock!!  So I got the disk  --still waiting for its arrival
  to try it out but they olet me use a credit card  and they said they will
  send me the updated chip which apparently has more updates than only the RAM
  hook.

(Sysop Tony) But there is considerable confusion about the product  since it
  is available in two versions,  AND as an enhanced UR-2 ROM chip, too.  The
  disk version, however, will stand alone.  The ROM version is not necessary,
  in order to use the disk version.  The UR-2 is not necessary in order to use
  the disk version.  The disk version is cheaper.  So there!  Any more?

(Bill T.) not now...I'll comment more when it arrives and I use it.... out

(PETER JABLOW) Will the disk version work with my current ur-2  or must I get
  the upgraded version?

(Sysop Tony) It will work with, but not at the same time.  The old UR-2 can
  not "Call" it. You'd have to use it as a "stand alone" program.

(PETER JABLOW) I assume from the main menu?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.

(Bill T.) ok  The TS people have an E-mail address on CIS, if there are any
  morecomments: :::76466,15... out

(Sysop Tony) Yes, and they are frequent visitors to the forum.  And have
  provided many description files of their products in DL13.  SARDINE is
  reviewed there.   See SARDIN.REV by associate sysop Denny Thomas.

(Sysop Tony) OK  [Current lineup = 0
  So I guess it's time to show the slides of my vacation.

(Bill T.) !!!!

(PETER JABLOW) QQ!
(JIM) q

(Sysop Tony) Oh, well... (disappointment), ga Peter J  [Current lineup =
  Peter, Jim]

(PETER JABLOW) When i got the ur-2 rom  I thought that the packing around the
  rom was rather flimsy  Is that a problem if it is replaced?

(Sysop Tony) You talking about replacing the ROM or the packing?

(PETER JABLOW) pulling the rom out, usung another rom  and thenputting it
  back in.

(Sysop Tony) Oh.  Well.... the socket is designed for semi-permanent use.
  There have been reports of damaged sockets, from those who change ROM's
  frequently.  Like 12 times a day, or so.  But I'd guess that changing ROM's
  occassionally wouldn't be a problem.  If you have a lot of ROM's, then maybe
  you need one  of PCSG's 6-ROM banks.  And i understand there is a new one
  about to appear,  that will hold only two or three.

(PETER JABLOW) Is there a review of the mult rom socket?

(Sysop Tony) I don't think so.  It's just a black box that bolts on,
  underneath the computer.  It holds up to 6 ROM's, and has an additional
  battery stack, and a switch on the end to select which one you want.
  You can see it in all the current ads for PCSG products.  Looks like a stand
  under the back of the computer.

(PETER JABLOW) about how much?

(Sysop Tony) Haven't the foggiest.  I'd guess about $200.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... ga Jim  [Current lineup = Jim]

(JIM) How can I find a list of CIS nodes  for Tyment & Telenet  not just the
  locations but CIS's codes

(Sysop Tony) Jim... GO PHONES will get you to a searchable list of all the
  access numbers that can get you into CompuServe.  You can specify
  baud rate, area code, and even Telenet or Tymnet.  They are plainly marked,
  if you read the code marks in the instructions.

(JIM) I am refering to the QXX type id used  by CIS not the phone numbers

(Sysop Tony) Oh, you're talking about the node identifiers,  not the phone
  numbers.  For that, GO NODES will get you a long, long list.

(JIM) that long list will include the CIS  nodes but not the QXX nodes...

(Sysop Tony) OK... that's all that I know is available.  Maybe you have to
  contact Telenet or Tymnet for greater detail.

(JIM) thank you ..

(Sysop Tony) ok  [Current lineup = 0  NOW is the time to show my slides.  No
  special Topic for today: Your choice. (Check new commands available here
  with /HELP command.)

(Bill T.) !!!!

(Sysop Tony) Now this one is of me in front of...

(Bill T.) QQQ!!

(Sysop Tony) Oh.... we'll wait a minute.... ga Bill

(Bill T.) <<whew!!!,, just in time...>>  Well, I've got a M200, and a lot of
  the programs are for theM100 in the DL Is there a list which matches the
  M100 calls, pokes, etc, with the M200??

(Sysop Tony) Yes there is...  Unfortunately, it is a copyrighted list,
  and was published in the June and July issue of Portable 100 last year.  We
  have bits and pieces in our Data library, in various files.  (all in DL8) but
  the definitive list is in those two articles.  As you've no doubt found, we
  have more M100 programs than T200.  That's because the M100 has been out
  longer, no doubt.  But gradually many of them are getting converted.  And of
  course many 100 programs will run on the 200 without change.  Using only the
  top half of the screen if the program is screen-specific.

(Bill T.) ok, tnx again....the new dl for m200 is appreciated....one more
  thing do we HAVE to look at the slides??

(Sysop Tony) well, if you guys don't keep me off the subject, I'll get around
  to them yet.  (grin) Lessee...  The big honcho is here this morning.  What
  say, Wayne?  How are things in Texas?

(Sysop Tony) Nah.... he's asleep!

(\/\/ayne) Sorry about that.. Was asleep at the wheel, I guess (actually, was
  working on the other computer, and kinda keeping half an eye on this one
  <blush>)

(Sysop Tony) well, new sysop Denny is here, too.  Hi Denny.  You have any
comments?

(Denny) No I just got up...  been on the night shift lately  makes mornings
  tough to handle.

(Sysop Tony) Gosh... I moved the CO up an hour, just to accomodate us guys on
  the West coast, and STILL you sleep in!  Denny... I suppose you are going to
  be very active in supporting the telecommunications aspects of the forum.
  How are things looking on that subject?  What would you REALLY recommend
  for general use?  Is 1200 baud with an external modem really that much
  better?  Worth the price?

(Denny) Well, since the price of modems is comming down dramatically,  and you
  can get around the problem of slow screen scroll in the M100, I think 1200
  baud is the way to go. The new WorldLink seems just perfect for portables.

(Sysop Tony) Of course, there really wouldn't be much value  in using 1200
  baud for something like conferencing where there are interminable waits for
  each line, But for downloading files, it would seem to be of value.  I've
  seen external 300 baud modems advertised now for as low as $25.  And the
  Avatec for $79.95.  You have one of those, is it a good buy?

(Denny) It's ok, not great  there is a little problem with local BBS's
  I sometimes lose data while I'm told that a Hayes doesn't have any
  problems with that same BBS.  For CIS, it works great though  I have that $79
  version there is a more expensive one that is  supposedly 95% Hayes
  compatible which might have fewer errors...

(Sysop Tony) The Hayes modems are generally more expensive than the Hayes
  "compatibles".  Like double in some cases.  Do the Hayes modems offer more
  features that would make the price difference warranted?  Or is it all in
  the label?

(Denny) No! There IS a difference if you get full Hayes compatiblity
  Like my Avatex...  It was billed as 80% compatible  but in actuality, if
  you count the commands, it's about 19%.

(Sysop Tony) OK....  Any specific brands you like?  Not necessarily recommend,
  but like?

(Denny) No, since I haven't used any except the ones I have, I couldn't be
  very objective. But I do like the WorldLink.

(Sysop Tony) OK... we have a review on that?

(Denny) Would you like me to do one? Or are you asking is there one?

(Sysop Tony) I thought we had one...  just looked, and yes... it's called
  W-LINK.REV.  in DL13. Thanks... Valuable information.

(Denny) Whew! got out of that one.

(Sysop Tony) A message came up on the board last week  that I answered. After
  thinking about it some I may have been wrong.  (not likely, but an outside
  chance...)  The question had to do with taking control of the Model 100 from
  an external computer or terminal, via modem.  At the time, I didn't
  understand the full depth of the question.  After reflection... (and a nasty
  note via Email...) ... I have come to the conclusion, that the missing link
  is the software to do it.  It seems like it would require some sort of ML
  program which would answer the modem, then pass input directly to the
  keyboard buffer.  So that input could issue the same commands that you
  could directly from the keyboard.  Whatcha think, Denny?

(Denny) Hmmm.... Seems complicated
  Does he want to run a basic program from the outside world?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  I'm constantly amazed at the things folks want the M100 to
  do. 

(\/\/ayne) What it sounds like the gent wants to do is run his M100 as a
  host with a program known as a Remote Driver acting as a pipe, so that  the
  input from the RS-232 is passed into the system such as if he was sitting
  there typing on the keyboard..  and the output is directed to the RS-232
  outgoing line. they're fairly common programs in most other computers,
  involving changing the input vectors for the keyboard handler (tell it to
  get its input from X instead of Y address)... and the output handler (ditto
  the change). But.. I don't think I've ever run across one for the M100  and
  come to think of it, I'm not sure why it would be so hard to do except for
  the fact that the vectors may be imbedded in ROM.

(Sysop Tony) Yes... that's how I understand the intent.  (Hi Phil)  We can get
  at the background task routines but such a program would probably have to
  redefine I/O as you say,  and involve intercepting those routines somewhere.
   You're right, however in the implication that no "local screen" output
  would be required.

(\/\/ayne) well, not required, but usually present.. at least in the versions
  I've seen running on the CoCo and/or the PC's and compatibles.

(Sysop Tony) Well, that's a project for a better programmer than I.

(Dennis E) the army corps of engs. does something like that w/ m100 for remote
  site weather info gathering  via microwave links, calling up specfiic
  m100,s in the field and getting them to upload the data

(Sysop Tony) But in that case, isn't the remote M100 just running a program
  that is busy gathering the data...

(Dennis E) not sure

(Sysop Tony) which is then dumped when it's called?  That should be easy  to
  do.  You never have to break out of the program.

(Dennis E) but it think it is set up to respond to differt qureies

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh. .... I think that can be done pretty easily.  What the
  message sender wanted to know about was actually loading and running
  programs in the M100 from a remote location.  A bit harder, I think.  Maybe
  we'll get some more input on that this week.  Denny did write a ML host
  program for my 200  to help in developing the Macros program.  But it's so
  specific, might not be of value to anyone else. Time for one last question
  if anyone has one.  Anyone?

(David H. Hawes) other than modifying a modem using  the cassette port to
  activate it,  is there a product sold which allows disk  transfer while on
  line?

(Sysop Tony) That's a complex subject...

(David H. Hawes) Ie a <uart> or some other device which holds the comm link?

(Sysop Tony) but basically, if you use an external modem, you can do a whole
  lot.  You can't go directly to the TDD, but you can download a chunk to RAM,
   then get off the modem, and dump it to disk, go back to the modem for more.
   I do it all the time with a 200, external modem and TDD.

(David H. Hawes) thanks, i guess thats all

(Sysop Tony) OK... one more advantage  with an external modem, you can
  graduate up to 1200 baud, which makes a BIG difference.  Any more on that?
  OK.... then it looks like it's time to close this one.  Thanks for coming,
  and for your input. We appreciate it.
