SURVEY OF USES OF TANDY LAPTOPS# OVERVIEWMessage # 185444, posted in mid-July 1989, requested information from membersof the Model 100 Forum on the ways in which they were using Tandy laptops.A total of 15 responses were received as of the morning of July 29. These replies are summarized here. The first section of this file gives percentagesby category of use. The second section reports the actual figures by respon-dent and category. The third section gives the names and ID numbers of therespondents, and the last section includes the specific comments of four ofthe members regarding Model 100/102/200 applications.# SECTION 1: Statistical Summary15 responses were received, providing data on the use of 20 machines:    9 - Model 100's         (45% of total)    2 - Model 102's         (10% of total)     4 - Model 200's         (20% of total)    5 - Model not indicated (25% of total)The original survey question included 8 categories of use; respondentsadded two more, for a total of 10 categories. By category, here are thecompiled responses:1)  A device for creating and sending news reports:    1 response received - 5% of machines, 6.6% of replies    % Use figure not indicated2)  A personal executive/managerial aid:    11 responses received - 55% of machines, 73% of replies       (1 respondent did not indicate % use)    % Use (Mean)  : 40.5%     % Use (Median): 32.5%     % Use (Mode)  : Bimodal at 15% and 75% (2 each)    % Use (High)  : 80%    % Use (Low)   : 5% 3)  Part of an industrial control system:    No responses received4)  A writer's tool:    12 responses received - 60% of machines, 80% of replies       (1 respondent did not indicate % use)    % Use (Mean)  : 35.4%    % Use (Median): 30.0%    % Use (Mode)  : 10.0% (3)    % Use (High)  : 95%    % Use (Low)   : 5%5)  A programmer's tool:    8 responses received - 40% of machines, 53% of replies    % Use (Mean)  : 46.3%    % Use (Median): 37.5%    % Use (Mode)  :  5.0% (2)    % Use (High)  : 100%    % Use (Low)   : 5%6)  A student's computer:    No responses received7)  A scientific/engineering computer:    3 responses received - 15% of machines, 20% of replies    % Use (Mean)  : 7.3%    % Use (Median): 5.0%    % Use (Mode)  : No mode    % Use (High)  : 15%    % Use (Low)   : 2% 8)  A hobby:    6 responses received - 30% of machines, 40% of replies    % Use (Mean)  : 38.8%    % Use (Median): 32.5%    % Use (Mode)  : 10.0% (2)    % Use (High)  : 98%    % Use (Low)   : 10%9)  Telecommunication:    3 responses received - 15% of machines, 20% of replies    % Use (Mean)  : 10.0%    % Use (Median): 10.0%     % Use (Mode)  : No mode    % Use (High)  : 15%    % Use (Low)   : 5% 10) Other:    1 response received - 5% of machines, 6.6% of replies    % Use: 15% # SECTION 2: Actual Responses, by category of useInitials indicate respondents listed in Section 3.1) A device for creating and sending news reports   CS - (% not reported)2) A personal executive/managerial aid   BB - 75%    GN - 65%    PG - 15% a)   DW - 30%   AR - 80%   PT - 35% (15% SRII Outlines, 10% SRII Spreadsheets, 10% TMPC Scheds)   AS - 15% (Scheduling and grades)   CS - (% not reported)   DS - 5% (Includes some telecommunications)   AW - 10%   DT - 75%3) Part of an industrial control system   (No responses, but see Mo Budlong's comments.)4) A writer's tool   BB - 20%   GN - 10%   PG - 25% a)    DW - 30%   AR - 10%   MB -  5%   PT - 50%   AS - 80%   CS - (% not reported)   DS - 95%   AW - 90%    JN - 10%5) A programmer's tool   BB - 5%   GN - 15%   PG - 50% a)      - 100% b)   AR - 5%    DP - 90%   MB - 80%   JN - 25%6) A student's computer   (No responses)7) A scientific/engineering computer   AR -  5%   SW -  2%   JN - 15%8) A hobby   GN - 10%   PG - 10% a)   DW - 40% (astronomy)    SW - 98%   JN - 50%   DT - 25%9) Telecommunication   DP - 10%   PT - 15% (BBS and CIS FAX)   AS -  5% 10) Other    MB - 15% (Telecommunications trouble shooting)# SECTION 3: Names of Respondents BB: Bill Brandon 76701,256         Model 100GN: Gene Nestro 73727,1015         Model 100PG: Paul Globman 72227,1661        a) 2 T200's (combined use)  b) M100DW: Dan Ward 76117,1725            Model 100AR: Alan Rowberg 76703,4421        ?DP: Doug Pratt 76703,3041          Model 100, Model 200SW: Stan Wong 70346,1267           ?MB: Mo Budlong 76167,3310        * ?PT: Peter Tucker 76012,3532      * 100AS: arnold r silverman 76340,356 * 102CS: ChristopherFranceschelli 70721,2466DS: Don Sakers 72517,526         * 100AW: Al Williams 73377,2433         ?JN: Jeremy Nichols 73527,2164      200DT:  Denny Thomas 76701,40         2 100's, 1 102# SECTION 4: Comments by RespondentsMO BUDLONG:... my experience providing compilers for engineering and other softwarehouses is that one industrial application will account for many many Model100/102's.Some of the applications I have worked on or helped with (at least those I amnot sworn to secrecy on) include.Police forces using PISTOL and other similar police reporting packages accountfor many thousand machines.Dedicated controller for a glass etching process. 5,000-10,000 machines.Telecommunications buffers between larger more expensive machines severalhundreds.Job tracking on factory floors, about 2000.Office desk-to-desk message system. Several Hundred.Download devices to capture data from data loggers. For example one firm tracksoil well pressures and oil tank filling and emptying and unloads the data to aModel 102. I know of a couple of thousand in similar categories.There are many software houses and data processing departments who are usingthe machine as a dedicated single task device. Once it has been dedicated tothis process, the DP department will buy 50 to 5000 machines depending on howthey are using them. I am frequently approached by Tandy sales people asking meto provide technical assistance to close deals that will amount to thousands ofModel 102 sales.The result is that there are scads of Model 100/102 users who are not realusers. I doubt that any of the thousands of glass etchers are Portable 100subscribers, or on the SIG or have any other interest in the machine.The largest volume of 102 sales is commercial and industrial, at least from myperspective, but none of this will show up in your survey since none of the enduser's can use the machine for anything else.The Model 102 is a long way from dead, but it is showing up in different hauntsthan it's original market.PETER TUCKER:Here's my best guess at what you want.Writer's tool - 50% Management tool (outlines in SUPER.ROM) 15% Spreadsheets(SUPER.ROM) 10% Scheduler (TMPC) 10% TelCom (BBSes and FAX via CIS) 15%Nothing really fancy, just a handy management tool.The outliner use may be understated.  I use it like a one line data base totrack the major accounts and prospects of my sales representatives.Also, the TelCom is higher since CIS added the facsimile ability to the system.I send 25-35 faxes per month via my M100.  Some in the early mornings when anidea or need strikes me.The M100 gets handier all the time!ARNOLD R SILVERMAN:I use my m102 about eighty pecent of the time as word processor, about fifteenpercent as scheduling device and data base for grades, bibliography etc andfive percent of the time for telecommunicating. There are two otherm100/102/200 users at the college that I am aware of. The m100/102/200's areused largely for word processing.DON SAKERS: Personal executive/managerial aid (mostly involving email on trips, a bit oftime management, and the odd task here and there that can't really becategorized anywhere else.) But overwhelmingly a writer's tool -- a good halfof the first draft of my last novel was pounded out on the Model 100 on lunchbreaks at work, and it looks as if the percentage is going to be just as highon the next book.
