(Rush C.) Hello...?

(Sysop Tony) Hello, Rush.

(Rush C.) No one else here yet

(Sysop Tony) You're right.

(Rush C.) What's the topic for today?  I am working on a program with a
  friend you may or may not find of interest.  It is a mail list program that
  can exchange its files back and forth with 2 versions of the program
  between a CoCo and M-100. right now we are trying to figure out how to
  "print" a file from basic and trick the coCo into thinking there is a
  printer on line and not a terminal.

(Sysop Tony) Sounds interesting.  I'm not familiar with the Coco environment,
  but seems like it's about the same as "Saving to COM:" in the M100.

(Rush C.) Well  The Coco uses its 232 port for both printer and modem, but if
  you have a null modem cable attached, the CoCo won't recognize it as a
  printer. I think the pins have to be wired differently for a modem or a
  printer.

(Sysop Tony) Why don't you ask Wayne Day?  He's familiar with the Coco.

(Rush C.) Probably will, there are a few Cocoists here  and they might like the
  program.  it does labels, phone lists, Rolodex, etc.

(Sysop Tony) All standard stuff.  The difference is the Coco _and_ M100
  application.

(Rush C.) The best part about it is that  a person would not need to have two
  programs because the program in each computer will handle the same files

(Sysop Tony) Same program works in both computers?

(Rush C.) Yes, the program is merely
  modified to run in M-100...but uses identical files.
  There were more people  here on Easter than today..

(Sysop Tony) Maybe a big game today somewhere?

(Bill Beeler) Was talking to Phil about the possibilty  of using a call to
  basic from DSKMGR to reenter basic and initiate DIRACC.  any comments?

(Sysop Tony) I don't have any.  Phil?

(Phil W) Hmmm...  well the intent is to download to TDD by holding phone  line
  while running dskmgr.  Not real likely. then too, it requires a hook into Key
  8 in DSKMGR (I think) and that one seems to be used by DIRACC.  Not a
  project with Gobs of hope  I'm afraid.   Now if he were to ask about macros
  with DIRACC (grin!).

(Sysop Tony) Personally, I don't understand why folks keep looking for a way
  to download  to the TDD disk.  It's been pretty completely explored in the
  last year or so, and smarter folks than us have even tried to write ML
  programs to do it, and haven't been able to.  As I understand it, the way
  it's possible  with Disk Power is even a fluke!  Works only with the cups. 
  But it does work with the 200/TDD combination.

(Bill Beeler) Ok.  One other thing that might  be of importance  is a problem
  that i had downloading files  larger than 8k onto my m100.   It seems that
  when i logged off that all of the ml prgrams would not be workable and would
  wind up in the strangests places when i tried to load them from ram.
  also many of the .do files would have a bunch of repaeated nonsense in them.

(R Caley) Not important...but  with all those CO files, one of the strange
  places you can visit is Jan 1, 1900 <grin>..

(Bill Beeler) exactly

(Sysop Tony) Bill, ...

(Marty T) [Been there several times myself]

(Sysop Tony) if you use multiple CO programs...

(Bill Beeler) It seems that when I take the m100...

(Sysop Tony) you should also be using a machine language manager program.
  Ok... you go ahead and finish, and let me know when you're done.

(Bill Beeler) apart and wigwiggle the installed(factory) ram chips that It
  cures the problem!

(Sysop Tony) ...to make sure that you load, execute,  and remove the programs
  properly.  Bits of code left from one time to the next, or improper
  clearing can cause random, unwanted, problems; including cold starts.
  FLIPML in DL7 might be a good program for you to try.  Your mention of
  wiggling the RAM chips would seem to indicate that you have a problem with
  one or more chips or the sockets they fit in.

(Bill Beeler) No problems clearing as only have 1 ml program current,  but
  after downloading a big file it would be corrupted and when trying to
  loadm the ml would wind up with addresses  of 0,7144,6333 and such.

(Sysop Tony) I have a glimmer of an idea...  it may be that you have so much
  stuff in your RAM already that when you download the "large file" it pushes
  your CO image up into the same area that it will eventually execute in.
  When you attempt to load it, it corrupts itself. 

(R Caley) I think your glimmer is somewhat like mine.  If he has the CO on the
  menu AND in memory the problem might be what you say.  If it were me I would
  keep the program on the MENU...BUT Clear0,MAXRAM before executing TELCOM  as
  TELCOM is very unforgiving in the ML arena.

(Phil W) Bill, you say  that you download these files and then load them.
  Implies you are downloading M/L files, perhaps how are you doing it and how
  are you loading them? what kind of files are they?

(Bill Beeler) Using selfclearing DSKMGR  and downloading to an otherwise empty
  100.  When (on occasion) I download anything over 8k the OM error comes up.

(Phil W) [bad chips??]

(Bill Beeler) when trying to run DSKMGR inorder to save the currently
  downloaded files to disk, When trying to load DSKMGR manually the adresses
  are all messed up and need to cold start to recover.
  When I try to recover the lost do file after the cold start I sometimes
  find some displaced ROM in the area of 33000 to 62000.

(Sysop Tony) Well, you've got some sort of problem there,
  that's going to take some hands-on, technical  troubleshooting.  Doubt that
  we can come up with anything definitive here.

(Phil W) I assume you  have 32K in the machine.  IF so, and if some of it is
  NOT RS original memory, I would suspect a bad chip.  About the cheapest
  thing you can do is get some good chips and do a replacement (say from PG
  Designs, since Peter is pretty fussy about RAM chip quality - if that does
  not work, take it to RSCC but that will be many more bucks than trying the
  memrory change-out yourself.

(Sysop Tony) Is this a 100 or 102?

(Bill Beeler) Was originally a 24k when new but was to ignorant to know if it
  was my fault or the computers have added an 8k from Node (they're only 25
  miles up the road) but the problems seem to correct itself after
  I open up the machine and move the original two 8k ram chips.
  the last time i did this I took them all the way out instead of wiggling
  them so perhaps this might? cure the problem but just wanted it on record
  incase it might help someone else.

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh.  The original 24K RAM chips are SOLDERED in, in an
  original 24K machine so yours was apparently originally an 8K machine  that
  somebody upgraded.  However, since you're in the No. Calif area  why not
` xontact Bill Templeton, of the Danville Tigers,  and attend one of their
  meetings.  There are many  technicos there, and if you show them what's
  happening,  maybe someone can figure it out.  Bill's User ID number is
  75655,1056.

(Bill Beeler) ok.  Won the computer from a RS dealer grand opening so maybe it
  was originally 8k but has RS chips in the next two opRAMS that are NOT
  soldered in.

(Sysop Tony) That may be the problem.  OK... any more on this question?  No?
  Then it's Slide time! Denny will hold them up to the light while I describe
  them.  I see we have only...

(Bill Beeler) Thanks for the help but the connect charges are eating me up bye

(Sysop Tony) 1 member here who isn't a sysop-type. I notice we have Doug Pratt
  here.  Hi Doug....
  So, you wanna talk about nicads, chargers, and etc.?  (pause)  I think Doug
  is monitoring but not listening.  So, let's discuss MACMAC... a new version,
  which patches MACPGM into the MACROS.DO file so you can send the code as a
  macro.  (grin)

(Phil W) Huh?  But I do have a comment re f-keys...

(Sysop Denny) Hmm.. sorta like Lisp

(Sysop Tony) well, ga ga ga ga!

(Phil W) Yeah!  Well...

(Sysop Tony) Denny... you remember when all the mag's had  "self-modyfying
  code"?

(Phil W) you know the concern with the issue of having the wrong f-key
  vectors, so change loaders and all.  Obvious thing to do is use SHLD (or
  such) to put them in from the m/l pgrogram each time it runs.  That would
  remove such things as line 20 pokes in XTLMAC.LDR.

(Sysop Tony) Refresh my memory on SHLD... what does it do, again?

(Phil W) Stor HL direct (to a specified memory location.  It would
  be the fkey locations in BASIC or the TERM vector locations.

(Sysop Tony) Allright  so what you're proposing, is to have the loader  do a
  poke?  Or have the ML code itself change the vector?  If the latter, how do
  you run it the first time?

(Phil W) Latter.  the first time and every time you just run the M/L code by
  entering it on the menu.  EACH time it will poke the right vectors  assuring
  that they are there.  Moreover, you may be able to get it to restore the old
  vectors at exit (suspect x-tel does this) alas, not all commercial pgms are
  as caring about our health!

(Sysop Tony) OK... I got that part; but how do you run the program the first
  time,  if the vectors aren't already right? .... and  if they reset on exit,
  how would you enter again?  I'm missing something here.

(Phil W) fkey vectors are not need to run a program from the menu; use the ldr
  to create the pgm on the menu, as now.  Then run the pgm. It is only while IN
  the program (X-TEL, xtlmac) that you use the f-keys. In the case of low-ram
  macpgm, you have a different problem  as we do with diracc, in that resident
  pgms are loaded each time so there would have to be a built in refresh loop
  that you pass through as the pgm does its thing.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah... OK.  What I see now is a short routine patched ahead of
  the main program...

(Phil W) (resident pgms are loaded ONE time!)

(Sysop Tony) entry address, that does a reset of the function key vector.  But
  why go through that loop every time?  Why not run it from ORIG the first
  time, then all future runs, jump into ORIG+n?  (ORIG+n = the original ORIG or
  entry point.)

(Phil W) Because some other event (other s/w) could reset the f-keys
  before you run the next time.  I would put in a refresh loop  that
  takes you thru the set loop each time.

(Doug Pratt) ??

(Sysop Tony) Well, try it out, and see how it works.  No harm in trying it
  on YOUR machine!  (grin)

(Phil W) RE DIRACC+MAC?

(Sysop Tony) Re any of them.  Any more on that idea, Phil?

(Phil W) Nope!

(Sysop Tony) OK... on to Doug Pratt.  ga Doug

(Doug Pratt) thanks... I have a real dumb question as you may know I buy up all
  the used 100s I can find as my work uses them.  My personal one has a
  Chipmunk which I love dearly - recently bought a used one with a TDD 1  and
  no manual! how does one boot FLOPPY.CO?

(Sysop Tony) Now Doug... you KNOW there are no dumb questions. .... Just dumb
  answers!  (grin)

(Doug Pratt) hiccup

(Sysop Tony) There is a 3-line loader program you have to type in  which, when
  run, loads FLOPPY.CO off the Utility disk, and into RAM.  Seems to me we
  have a file in the DL's somewhere which lists that three liner which the
  manual calls the "IPL" program.  But IPL stands for something else, anyway.

(Phil W) Some of the  ROMs will boot it automatically, in one way or another
  SuperROM F7 from menu will boot FLOPPY.  UR-2 & Sardine will load and run
  any program named DOS100.CO on the disk; much easier way to go -- if you have
  one of those chips in the  machine in question.

(Doug Pratt) thanks a bunch, guys  somewhere in the 24 M100s  I'm responsible
  for, there's a SuperROM (in my PERSONAL M100...chortle)  I just want to say
  I owe you guys a LOT for the tremendous resource M100SIG has been  to me. if
  you ever get interested in model planes call me first!

(Sysop Tony) Aw shucks.... (blush)  We just do what we can.  Any more?

(Phil W) [wish he was a diamond merchant!]

(Doug Pratt) hee hee  that's it, thanks!

(Sysop Denny) Doug, I think we declined to put the IPL program for FLOPPY here
  in the DL's since it is a copyrighted program. Or published at least.

(Sysop Tony) You may be right.  We do have the info on how to load the TDD-2
  version since it's a one-liner.  But I recall the question coming up about
  the one in the manual being copyrighted.

(Doug Pratt) no problem - I'll use SuperROM.  forgot it did that since  I use
  the Munk and I'll tell you, I've developed some interesting  procedures
  for using the Munk, 256k of PGD Ram and Super ROM at once! It made the book
  manuscript I just finished a lot easier.

(Sysop Tony) Ah! Another writer votes for the Chipmunk!

(Doug Pratt) loud and often!

(Sysop Tony) If you expect any extensive use of the model you have with the
  TDD, suggest you get one of the alternate DOS's for it, which will give you
  similar capabilities to the Chipmunk.  i.e. writing to and from the disk in
  BASIC, etc. More than just file saving and loading from a menu.

(Doug Pratt) thanks  yes, that's in the plan.  you see, I work for an
  association of model fliers, our executive staff is all over the US and we
  use ModelNet for corporate communication. when I evaluated machines to give
  to non-computer types so they could use the Net, the M100 won hands down, so
  my more sophisticated users get the peripherals as they learn to handle
  them. thanks for the help, troops.

(Sysop Tony) Have you seen the file DISKOS.INF in DL13?

(Doug Pratt) yup

(Sysop Tony) good place to start exploring the various DOS's.

(J.D.) Doug, don't know which OS you're leaning toward  but it's worth noting
  the Acroatix's POWR-DOS will be discounted heavily (currently talking
  about 50% + discount) to Club 100 members  so perhaps that could count in
  your decision.

(Sysop Tony) Power-DOS seems to be  the "heaviest" DOS for the TDD.  In the
  sense of most capability.  Do they have a TDD-2 version available, JD?

(J.D.) Tony, I am not certain. I believe they said they do, but would have to
  check.

(Sysop Tony) There hasn't been any comment around here  yet as to which
  companies were going to support the TDD-2.  So we don't have any idea.  Ed
  Geise of Acroatics has not been around here lately.

(J.D.) Tony, I met yesterday with Richard Eckerlin and Hugo Ferryera of
  UltraSoft at the Montreal M100 User Group meeting. A TDD-2 version of Disk
  Power is in the works with new features, but the original...

(Phil W) [Hugo lives!]

(J.D.) version works with the TDD-2, as has been reported here. Works  nicely,
  actually, as it keeps the whole disk as one bank. Also, hasn't Traveling
  already announced a TDD-2 version of TS-DOS (but not TS-RANDOM)? Believe
  that's the currentest information.

(Sysop Tony) Yup... that one we know about.  But no word from Acroatics,
  Traveling, or others.  If Traveling has one, they haven't mentioned it here.
   I have a version of TS-RANDOM, but no TDD-2 to try it on.

(Phil W) There is a TS-DOS for the TDD2. And I believe Sardine supports it
  too.  Latest TS-DOS runs with either, I think but not interested in TDD2 so I
  have not followed up.

(Sysop Tony) That's just it... we aren't getting many new product description
  files lately.  Perfunctory presence is all; seems like  they've all given up
  on direct online support.

(J.D.) Tony, want Product sections from Laptop User posted?

(Sysop Tony) That would be Super!  Yes.... what  do we hafta do?

(J.D.) It's done. Just lemme put a "posted by permission" notice on 'em @Zd
  I'll upload 'em myself. Also reviews, listings if you wish. We're sending
  disks to several local BBSs and user groups too. We all gain if we
  increase access to information. So just let me know what you want.

(ADAM SCULL) JUST SPOKE TO TS...THEY SAID RANDOM DOESN'T WORK ON TDD2 YET

(Sysop Tony) E V E R Y T H I N G !

(J.D.) [ n o t e d ]

(Sysop Tony) Great!  DL13 is the place for the product descriptions.  Be sure
  to note the stuff came from Laptop User.

(Sysop Tony) (Thanks, Adam)

(Sysop Tony) OK  BTW, I FINALLY received the missing issue #1.  you remember,
  the one you sent by Camel-pack!  (grin) 

(J.D.) [no need to mention that we musta lost an address; bad for the image,
  no?] Anybody else having trouble receiving magazine?

(Sysop Tony) No... not a lost address,  just a verrrrrry slooooooooow postal
  truck.

(Sysop Denny) No, J.D. - I now am the proud owner of TWO copies.

(J.D.) Due to receiving various mailing lists from various sources at  various
  times, we didn't have time to merge before mailing issue #1 we've heard from
  folks who have received three copies. I think that's all taken care of. We
  just mailed issue #2 last week, and the whole list is said to be merged.
  NEW TOPIC: Anybody remember who it was who asked about changing the Tab in
  TEXT from an ASCII 9 to five ASCII 32s? Next issue includes a few  bytes of
  m/l code to solve the problem. Also fixes the DATE bug and adds a few new
  screen and keyboard functions. I'd like to make sure the person with the
  question doesn't miss out now that we've answered it.

(Sysop Tony) No. ... Phil _might_ be able to locate the original message.  but
  it's been a while.  Usually that sort of info, "Who", only sticks in the mind
  if a thread develops.

(Phil W) Nifty -- more m/l is always good!  When was the msg (about) and to
  who?

(ADAM SCULL) QUESTION! CAN SXM SUPPORT THE WORLDPORT 1200 MODEM?

(J.D.) Okay. It's a hot little utility that scans the keyboard and then
  stuffs code into the keyboard buffer. Also lets you view time, date, day of
  week...

(Sysop Tony) (Just a minute Adam, and Denny can answer that.)

(J.D.) from within TEXT and TELCOM and BASIC (and many applications), some
  other stuff. Don't remember who the message was addressed to (a fair
  bet it was to SYSOP or ALL).

(Sysop Tony) My guess is "All".  Sounds like an adaptation of the code being
  developed for the macros program a substitute scanning routine, looking for
  the call key.  Let's let Denny deal with Adam's question, then return to
  this if interested.   Denny?

(Sysop Denny) ok  Adam...

(ADAM SCULL) YES

(Sysop Denny) SXM does not have any provision for use with any external
  modem as of yet...

(ADAM SCULL) SXM..CAN IT SUPPORT THE WORLDPORT 1200 CURIOUS IF THERE WILL BE

(Sysop Denny) but that sounds like an interesting project.  There is only
  support for the internal modem.

(Sysop Tony) Adam...

(ADAM SCULL) IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE AN XMODEM

(Sysop Tony) It helps if you wait until someone is finished before you go
  ahead.

(ADAM SCULL) SORRRY, THIS IS NEW TO ME

(Sysop Tony) XMODEM.312 supports an external modem.  ga  (pause)

  (Now you can go ahead, Adam)  ga

  Any more, Adam?

(ADAM SCULL) ILL JUST LISTEN FOR NOW, BUT THANKS!

(Sysop Denny) Unfortunately, XMODEM.312 only supports a Smartcat modem.  the
  commands are different than normal Hayes.

(Sysop Tony) Ah!  Then we need a merge file to convert XMODEM.312 to work
  with the Hayes-type's.

(Sysop Denny) Yes, that would be nice  Since you suggested it...Tony?

(Sysop Tony) Well, I'll look around.  I've already done a bunch of
  modifications to good old .312.   One more isn't impossible.  OK, Adam?  Any
  more questions on that? ga Adam ga

(ADAM SCULL) NO, I JUST HOPE THAT ONE DAY I CAN FIND A WORLDPORT TO WORK IN
  XMODEM, BUT THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN ENLIGHTNING

(Sysop Tony) OK... Charles is up next  But Phil's comment first.  (We always
  take comments before questions)

(Phil W) Denny, can you mod qport to make it run xmodem.312 after dialing?
  ooops -- no DT!

(Sysop Tony) I'll look into that, Phil.  (QPORTX.100?)

(CHARLES CULHANE) charles c. anyone out there use mod 100 with scripsit 100
  and epson printer?

(Phil W) I did long ago

2+V-,$VKWr you)

(Phil W) what [oHthe question?

(CHARLES CULHANE) i am trying to find out how to send printer commands to mod
  100 through epson printer to underline and bold. no luck so far.

(Sysop Tony) (Charles, type shorter lines so we know you're there)

(Phil W) There is a file on that called EMBED.TXT...

(CHARLES CULHANE) ok, tnx

(Phil W) in DL 2. ...

(CHARLES C}iULHANE) tnx. but can it be done just  with epson control codes?

(Phil W) you will also be advised to read SCPSIT.THD in DL4.  Yes... it is FOR
  epson codes.  Note that SCPSIT does not support codes ...

(CHARLES CULHANE) ok tnx much ok tnx

(Phil W) internally (as far as I recall).  You have to use a CTRL-P to embed
  them.  See the file.

(Sysop Tony) Any more on that, Charles?

(CHARLES CULHANE) i have y i have tried the Cont P but  no luck making it
  function so far.

(Sysop Tony) Well, it's a simple...

(Phil W) Yes there are problems.  EMBED.TXT has solutions.

(Sysop Tony) and standard proceedure.

(CHARLES CULHANE) ok tnx much.

(Phil W) [it is the chr$(0) issue]

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Let me remind you new folks to read the two files in DL1
  NEWCO.HLP and CONFER.HLP which provide information on the new Conference
  commands, protocols, etc.  Lots of good information there.  Well, it looks
  like we're out of time for this morning's conference.  So I'll end the
  formal conference now.  Feel free to stick around and chat further, if you
  like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we appreciate your input.   Bye.
