(Sysop Denny) Hi Phil

(Phil W) hI Denny -- you wanna host this thing?

(Sysop Denny) well, I have an idea  You could field the Q's and I could take
  care of the hardware I have Tony's macros  like  or

(Phil W) Send "C" or "Q" for place in [Lineup:

(Sysop Denny) ok?  how's that?

(Phil W) how about Ummm .. not QUITE sure how that will work.  And your macros
  are a bit long! BTW

(Sysop Denny) well they are the ones Tony is using currently.

(Phil W) Seems we need a new letter: C for comment, Q for Quest, A for answer.

(Sysop Denny) That would be good

(Phil W) (A means I have an answer to the current question)

(Sysop Denny) You should suggest it to Tony  To include in CO help file

(Larry L) Morning all

(Sysop Denny) anywhere else

(Phil W) Will do.  Been in my mind for a while, but I forget to say anything

(Sysop Denny) Hi Larry

(Phil W) Morning Larry

(Sysop Denny) On time as usual.

(Larry L) Hi guys...Denny..you a sysop now?

(Sysop Denny) Yes, have been for a while now.

(Larry L) Aha..you usually dont ID as sysop.

(David Sommer) hello all

(Sysop Denny) Well, Have been for the last few weeks.

(Larry L) Congrats..Tony here too?

(Sysop Denny) Tony will be absent today  has a prior commitment.

(Sysop Denny) Ok we're about ready to begin  Phil Wheeler will be helping me
  out...

(CURT) HI ALL

(Sysop Denny) (lots) so here it goes
  Ga Curt

(CURT) ANY reports on pg design 256 k ram? bugs?

(Phil W) None, Curt.  I got one of
  the first and no problems..  However, there were some early  software bugs
  (two, I think).  They have been sqauashed to the best of my knowledge.

(CURT) ram file management uses 1.4 k per bank?

(Phil W) Yes

(CURT) thanks

(Phil W) And  well worth it -- because you get some nifty utilities  in fact
  I use that software in the M100 I have that does not have the banks, just
  for the utilities! ga

(CURT) ok

(Larry L) ok  PCSG ram uses aux ROM for software..PG...

(Phil W) [oops -- 1.6K]

(Larry L) uses ROM on the board.. correct?

(Sysop Denny) Phil?

(Phil W) Yes

(CURT) yes

(Phil W) That is one of the puzzles to me.  With the PCSG board  you must
  pull (SuperROM or whatever) to put in the bank transfer  capability.  Seems
  a bit self-defeating.  I would (at least) offer a ROM version of the bank
  transfer routines. ga

(CURT) and it can damage the rom compartment

(Sysop Denny) ok, Larry

(Larry L) ok  Yes..that can be a problem
  I tend to use the M100 as four separate machines(Telcom ,Desk,etc.) and then
  install the Rom to shift the progs as  needed.

(Sysop Denny) ok, anymore on this?  Ok, next up is Doug

(Doug) My interest is in barcode applications

(CURT) is the ram utility basic or co?

(Doug) I'm looking to read and write 3 of 9

(Larry L) ok  The tape contains CO programs for each  of the formats the BCR
  uses...There are also basic progs that give you a choice of formats and
  incorporates them into an inventory type format..

(CURT) ok thanks

(Sysop Denny) Doug?

(Doug) I see there`s a library in dl 7 on the topic

(Sysop Denny) Ga Phil

(Phil W) We have two things going

(Doug) and I am suprised that there is so little among computer stores  to
  support barcode use.  Is it reliable??? ga

(Phil W) let me try to get them both.  For Curt: CO disguied as  a basic
  loader.  For Doug:  The software supports the 100/102 only, I believe.  T200
   owners should make sure there is sofwrae they can use.  And printing is
  another issue: Must be sure the  bar code writing routines support the
  printer you have. ga

(Doug) Phil ,  thanks.  Will continue to look.

(Sysop Denny) May I also mention  that Bill Templeton is our resident  barcode
  maven. He would be able to  help you out

(Phil W) [maven!]

(Sysop Denny) now, if only I had my PPN list!

(Phil W) [maven roost in fora]

(Sysop Denny) We have a C from Larry, ga Larry.

(Larry L) ok

(Doug) [and I'll get out my dictionary]

(Larry L) I was just going to say that the BCR seems very finnicky about the
  reading  surface.  I doesn't want to read through  cellophane.

(Phil W) [Bill Templeton = 75655,1056]

(Sysop Denny) Thanks Phil  Any more, Doug?

(Doug) got it .. thanks..

(Sysop Denny) Ok, next up is Phil...ga Phil.

(Phil W) OK  I have a question for Denny.  I've gotten the MACRO software
  from...

(CURT) ok

(Phil W) Tony but I have not installed on my 0menu loader yet.  Perhaps you
  can give us a short review, Denny. ga

(Sysop Denny) Well, it works! ...
  But today is my first attempt at using it  so I'm not really to sure yet
  ask me again at the end of CO! ga

(Phil W) OK  I was assuming you might conduct the whole CO in macro-speak!

(Sysop Denny) well, If I could...

(Phil W) [done]

(Larry L) ok  I was hoping that the Macro software  would be available in the
  DL's as  shareware..(I don't like ordering through the mail)...any chance?

(Sysop Denny) You don't have to order it  just ask Tony and he'll give you a
  copy He is keeping it out of the DL's during this development  process so he
  can keep track of people using the program and send them updates when
  necessary

(Phil W) You covered it!

(Larry L) [Tony..please EMAIL details..thanks]

(Sysop Denny) Ok, any more on MACROs?  ga Phil

(Phil W) Yes

(Larry L) [woops..no Tony]

(Dick B.) Hi

(Phil W) Larry, I think you will have to give Tony info re your computer
  whether you use PG Designs bank, Supera, etc.  His software lives at the
  bottom of RAM, much like those programs.  He has differnt versions to
  accommodate.  BTW -- do you know the name/loation of the DOC file in the
  DL's Denny? ga

(Larry L) [thanks fyl]

(Sysop Denny) Yes, MACROS.DOC in DL3  I think  I have all my stuff boxed right
  now and am winging it. ga

(Phil W) That is it. Just checked.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, any more?

(Phil W) from hoo?

(CURT) re chipmunk op sys uses 5K?

(Sysop Denny) Ok, Curt  The 'Munk uses actually about 4K  but the operating
  system is twice that size It pages in parts that it needs at different times.
  ga Curt

(CURT) ok thanks

(Sysop Denny) Next up David, ga David

(David Sommer) ok  I had something come up a few weeks  ago concerning  the
  National Email Registry

(CURT) bye all

(David Sommer) In OLT (feb) they said config  was 7 bits, even parity, 1stop
  bit which is m7e1e on my M100  i use that for compuserve any way  but  when
  i tried to dial them up they didn't like it  received garbage
  intermittently now when I changed to M7i1e,  everything worked fine  any
  comments? ga

(Sysop Denny) Whew, Ga R.C.

(R Caley) ok  probably they made a typo..but  if it works, don't fix it  use
  m7i1e..ga

(Sysop Denny) To you, David

(David Sommer) ok  one more thing,  what are these "macros" you all  were
  talking about earlier? ga ga

(Sysop Denny) Well, here's one:
  Send a "Q" to get in speaking lineup to ask a question or change topic; ...
  Send a "C" to comment on the current topic. ...
  Now, I just typed in a "2" and got  all of that. If you see the file
  MACROS.DOC in DL3 it will explain it fully.

(David Sommer) thats all for now

(Sysop Denny) Ok, Next up is R.C. ga R.C.

(R Caley) OK  One Comment and 1 question  Comment:  In re:
  "MAVEN"...I looked in 4 dictionaries and could not find it  Maybe it's
  macrospeak QUESTION: ...

(Sysop Denny) Did you look in a Yiddish dictionary?

(Phil W) [It's in my Websters!]

(R Caley) no..don't have one

(Phil W) [maven or mavin or mayvin]  [try "fora"]

(Sysop Denny) What's your Q, R.C.?

(Larry L) [From the Hebrew word MAYVEEN...to know (something]

(R Caley) OK  I saw on the SIG there was some software  being developed for
  DV/I that will allow downloading CO's to disk  Really??...When available
  and will it work for other stuff too?

(Larry L) [bye all]

(Sysop Denny) [Boy, I'm glad I got the usage correct]
  There are some programs available that should do that

(Phil W) [PD?]

(Sysop Denny) SXM.100 comes to mind

(Phil W) [for .CO's?]

(Sysop Denny) scratch that. I thought you meant  conferences, oops.

(R Caley) I did

(Phil W) [ooops!]

(Sysop Denny) Well, in that case, SXM.100 should work.

(R Caley) ok  It said it was being developed  and I wondered if done.ga

(Phil W) I'm not aware of anything new along those lines, and I did  read all
  of last months messages in the last two days There is a nice new utility for
  the DVI by Martin Zimmerman (camz) which does some of the disk utility stuff
  we have for the 'munk and TDD.

(R Caley) It was a ok..that's it Im going to go buy  a new dictionary now..

(Sysop Denny) Grin  Next up is David, Ga David

(David Sommer) ok  I was just wondering,  since compuserve is so  generous
  with rates for 2 months if a "lunch time" CO could be  organized?

(Sysop Denny) Well, It would mean that someone would have to be available for
  lunch I'm not too sure about that  but you can CO any time you want to  and
  if organized enough, we could post it in the bulitens (sic). ga Phil ga

(Phil W) Which time zone, David?

(David Sommer) [MST]

(Phil W) Time zone  would be a problem since most are problably not MST (or is
  that now MDT) There are a fair mumber on each coast, and that is a
  three-hour spread Probably makes a lunch CO a bit hard to do.

(Sysop Denny) Eric, Comment?

(Eric S.) Yea  besides the time zone prob, not everyone  takes a standard
  "Lunch Time" ga

(Sysop Denny) Right, ga David

(David Sommer) some may (like me) be able  to skew their lunch period  a few
  hours for the other guys

(GARY A. WATTERS) TOP

(David Sommer) Also, lunch really means

(GARY A. WATTERS) EXIT

(David Sommer) mid day for me.

(Phil W) [/ex, gary]

(Sysop Denny) Gary, Use CTRL-C to exit back to the forum; but stay! You might
  learn something new.

(Bill Heiman) Hello

(Sysop Denny) Ok Larry, you've been waiting patiently  ga Larry

(LARRY R.) OK  Break out the Guy Lombardo records  'cos it's New Years Day,
  1900 here this PM and I am having problems re-loading my DOS from my Tandy
  Disk Drive 2.  Anybody got any tips?

(Sysop Denny) Ga Phil

(LARRY R.) wait!  can you see this  ga Denny

(Sysop Denny) Yes, Larry?

(Phil W) It's pretty straight forward Larry.. what are the problems? I see it!
  ga Problem is what?

(LARRY R.) I was starting to say,  Please allow me to finish>>>  I was
  starting to say, is one supposed to type in that line 10, then <CR>
  before entering the business about save"IPL"?  Also, the  business about
  turning DD off then on with diskette in seems to be questionable
  in any event, I am not getting the intial  screen.

(Phil W) Key thing is to type IPL in as a DO file, then convert to Basic and
  save to menu.  Then set the switches and turn the TDD off, then on again
  (doesn't matter if disk is in, but you must do it to initialize  the
  electronics).  Then after booting, set the switches back and ...

(LARRY R.) Which switches?

(Phil W) do the off-then-on bit once again.   It is easy to make an error in

(Tim Barber) ??

(Phil W) typing in IPL.  mUst be all UPPER case  What drive do you have.. TDD,
  new TDD (TD2), or Purple? ga

(LARRY R.) tdd2

(Phil W) Aha!  ABout that I know nothing!

(Bill H) ok  larry the switches are the four switches  under the little door
  on the bottom of the tdd they only have to be turned off to init

(Phil W) [does TD2 have switches, Bill?]

(LARRY R.) This IS the TDD 2 we're talking about

(Bill H) the unit then have to be turned back on to operate normally after you
  have floppy co ok

(Sysop Denny) No Switches for TDD2

(LARRY R.) never flipped switches to do this w  Can we take

(Bill H) ok sorry.

(LARRY R.) that from the top?  Denny

(Sysop Denny) Larry, Why don't you leave a message...

(LARRY R.) you got any tips?

(Sysop Denny) to ALL about this, there are some  TDD2 users out there that
  will be able...

(LARRY R.) 'cos I'm here now and thought I could get some answers

(Sysop Denny) to help. Mel Snyder comes to mind...

(LARRY R.) faster on line live than via messages  as all my files, programs
  &cetera are on the disk.

(Tim Barber) ?

(Dick B) I'm new so I'm just going to listen

(Sysop Denny) ok, let's see if Eric has an answer ga Eric.

(Eric S.) No, was just  going to make a Comment bout the PDD  not the 2.  The
  one thing Larry you probably ARE suppost to type the  line 10 stuff before
  the SAVE"IPL stuff (just a guess, don't hold me  to it)

(LARRY R.) The book shows a return  agy  after the IPL stuff  but not between
  the line 10 and the IPL

(Eric S.) What did you do the first time?

(DaveW.) Hi, all.

(LARRY R.) Typed in  10 RUN"COM:98N1ENN"<CR>  SAVE"IPL"<CR>  THEN TYPED IN
  RUN<CR> THEN TURNED ON THE TDD2  AND WAITED FOR INITIAL SCREEN DESCRIBED  ON
  PAGE 8 GOT NOTHING, BUT IPL.BA SHOWS ON  MAIN MENU!!!

(Sysop Denny) Larry, Might be that you need to turn on the TDD first?

(Eric S.) Try turning on the  Oops sorry.

(LARRY R.) GA.

(Sysop Denny) If that's the order that you did the  procedure, I think you
  need to turn on the TDD first ga Eric ga

(Eric S.) Just wanted to say that unless  you are using it on the Tandy 200...

(LARRY R.) i'm not

(Eric S.) you probably dont need the last two N's  in line 10.

(Sysop Denny) The M100 ignores the extra, Eric.  Any more Larry?

(LARRY R.) We'll I guess not, I'll hop off  and keep trying.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, Next up is Eric...ga Eric

(Eric S.) Just a quick one bout the Munk  Know you said that there was no prob
  with Uploading from disk, and just wondered  if their Download to disk
  supported xmodem.

(Sysop Denny) There is a program  X-TEL, which supports Xmodem  it is
  commercially available from Sigea Systems there is a product file in DL13
  that you can grab by doing a BRO X-TEL

(Eric S.) Understood.  Thanks.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, next is Tim, ga Tim  oops, we seem to have lost Tim  Well,
  there better be a question quick or I'll get out Tony's slides
  He sent me a duplicate set  Ok, Dana,

(Phil W) [or send an uninterruped series of macros!]

(Dana Hyde) What are the slides about?

(Sysop Denny) Well, most of them are travel  I'll describe them if you like

(Phil W) [Oh no!]

(Dana Hyde) Let's hear about it.

(Sysop Denny) Geesh, It's a joke! please!

(David Sommer) [my TELCOM doesn't support graphics from slides]

(Sysop Denny) I think we have a real Q from Bill, ok?

(Bill H) ok
  not really I was going to say  did I scare you the other night when  I
  accidentally sent a control J and  I think you thought I was going to
  upload to the CO room    ga

(Sysop Denny) Oh, I thought you were trying to upload a message here to CO

(Bill H) nope  it was a goof   .

(Sysop Denny) when it would have been much better to  leave it on the board.
  ok

(Bill H) i did and got an ans     tks.

(Sysop Denny) No problem  next up is Dana. ga Dana

(Dana Hyde) Heard anything about this new Tandy laptop club  advertised in a
  "portable computing" magazine recently? ga

(Sysop Denny) Comments, Phil?

(Phil W) Well  Must be Club 100.  You probably know more than I, since I've
  been out of things for a couple of months.

(Sysop Denny) Well, It is a Club attached to...

(Dana Hyde) I wonder if they"re trying to pick up  P100"s subscribers?.

(Sysop Denny) Laptop User magazine  Which doesn't have P100 mailing list  It
  is a free mag that is supposedly supported by advertisement  I haven't got
  my copy yet, so maybe someone else who has recieved it can comment  Anyone?
  ga

(Bill H) how can I subscribe.

(Phil W) There is a file  in DL13, I think with the info  the Club 100 part is
  a loose affiliation, I believe.  Was started in SF

(Sysop Denny) [MAG.100, DL13]

(Phil W) are by Danville Tigers and is a local BBS there.  When Denny and I
  call it is a long distance toll.  NOt sure whether there is any more to it.

(Bill H) tnks

(Sysop Denny) Well, Club 100 was started by Rick Hanson  and the Danville
  Tigers just use it to  communicate between meetings. ga Dana

(Phil W) [yes, that's it!]

(Dana Hyde) I dont have the mag handy, but the club I'm  referring to is based
  in Salem, Mass.ga

(Phil W) [Hmmm.. a coven of mavens?]

(Sysop Denny) Well, I'm not sure about that one, Dana  Anyone else heard of
  that?

(DaveW.) [could it be BLUG?]

(Sysop Denny) Could be, Dave  The Boston Laptop User Group  they upload their
  transcrips to DL1 There is a current one there right now. ga Dana.

(Dana Hyde) Thanks much.  q

(Sysop Denny) Ga Dana

(Dana Hyde) I got a mailing from Ultra Soft recently
  anyone had any experience with Text Power 100 or Ultrascreen?

(DaveW.) [I believe Phil has a comment.]

(Phil W) Well  NOt much on this.  TP100 is good software, BUT you have to buy
  individual drivers for each printer you want to use with it.  This to me is
  a  big minus.  Even with PRN100 here on the SIG you can build your  own.  On
  Ultra screen I have zero info. ga OK dana?

(Sysop Denny) Ok, We have time for a quick one from Dave and David  ga DaveW

(DaveW.) I have tried twice unsuccessfully  to download a CAT/DES from DL3
  using the old program XMODEM.312...

(MARC) HI, I am new to the M100 sig forum  who is in charge here?

(Phil W) [wait marc]

(DaveW.) for direct download to Chipmonk disk
  Keep getting a communications drop. Any ideas?

(Sysop Denny) No, It should work
  I used that program before I started using SXM and X-Tel. ga Phil

(DaveW.) [Not using xmodem protocol.]

(Phil W) Doing a capture or xmodem download?

(DaveW.) Capture only.

(Sysop Denny) Ah, I don't think Xmodem.312 handles that

(Phil W) Denny, what were the problems we used to have -- sxm or xmodem312?

(Sysop Denny) SXM had the Chipmunk problem  but is cured in SXM.CHP.

(DaveW.) Worked ok in DL4.

(Sysop Denny) That's strange  why don't you post a message telling us your
  procedure so we can examine it a little closer.

(Phil W) [command was S/DES?]

(DaveW.) command was CAT/DES  It would appear that I may

(Phil W) [try S/DES]

(DaveW.) be recieving a control code  from CIS that is bombing communications.

(Sysop Denny) That could be  There are glitches sometimes  you might have just
  got caught in the middle. ga

(DaveW.) Ok, thanks.

(Sysop Denny) We should end now, but we have one last one from David. ga David

(David Sommer) well  I have a big one that I think  I'll save for next time

(Sysop Denny) ok, If you think it should be handled early in CO we'll do it
  next week I'll end the formal conference now,  but feel free to stick
  around chat further. Thanks for comming  we appreciate your input  and a
  special thanks to Phil for helping out today.  ** End Of Conference **
