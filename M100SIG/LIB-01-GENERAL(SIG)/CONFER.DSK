(Bill S) About the TDD. Curious about.
       1. Physical size of floopies.
       2. Battery Operation ?
       3. Memory Requirements. 
(Sysop Tony) Floppy's = 3.5 inch square, by 1/8 inch. Uses 4 AA cells or AC
 power. Requires about 8K to load OS then 3.6 K to store it as a .CO program
 and about the same to execute it when you want to access the disk.
(Bill S) How about max storage on floppies?
(Sysop Tony) 101K per disk.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) There are files in the database that answer most of your
  questions in greater detail ... see DRIVE.REV, DRIVE.PRE in DL 6
  and the TDDTIP files in DL 5.


(John R) .^Dave^., do you have any further discoveries concerning the 600 that
 you could share?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, I've made a lot of progress in the area of file handling
  and use of WORD as well as disk access et cetera. Sometime this week I'll be
  putting up some files with the results. In DL 0, they will be WRDnnn.600
  in DL 1, TELnnn.600 et cetera. Tony, have you a HOT bulletin ??
(Sysop Tony) lCan't recall any.... 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, I'll just report that it is a LOT faster to copy a file
  from the A: disk using the <C>opy command from the System Manager than it is
  to access the disk and THEN load a file. Interesting stuff coming out.
(John R) I have been wandering in to my friendly local RSCC and playing with
 the 600, but it is clearly not a machine that one can master in just a few
 minutes!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I'm surprised, in a way, at how fast I'm learning my way
  around and I guess your comment underscores the need for the tip files we'll
  be putting up.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, onward to more nibbles and bytes.
(Bill S.) Portable 100/200 gave the Tandy DD a warm review at best.
 does it deserve it?
(jim a.) yes!!!
(Sysop Tony) Well,...  Yes, overall. The TDD is less than a fully operational
 disk drive. But within it's limitations, it's a good device. It's a step up
 from a cassette at a reasonable price. But loses some of the cassettes'
 abilities along with it's improvements.
(Brooks) the hardware is good and later software for the TDD...
 should make it alot warmer 
(Bill S.) What specific abilites Tony?
(Sysop Tony) It can't access files directly like you can with a cassette.
(John R) And, even with better software you STILL won't be able to download
 directly to it. 

(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, a further comment on the 600. As you noticed, last week
  Mortie was lurking in Channel 10 and downloading the conference ...
(rowlfe) [who's lurking there NOW?]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Due to Tymnet trashing of THIS copy of the CO we were able to
  use Mortie's copy for the transcript now in DL 8. Likewise, t'was that 50K
  file that I used to time some Search and Replace operations and other WORD
  capabilities as well as disk use practice et cetera.
  Rowlfe, that is Mortie up there now too.

(DaveW.) Any info on Sig for accessing 'munk using M/L?
(Sysop Tony) DISKML.CHP in DL5 details the process.
(DaveW.) I made one attempt at using the info described and didn't get anywhere
 however am not possitive I had the code 100%.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) not so sure about that. PPN is not Corbitt's as far as I know
(Sysop Tony) Send msg to Larry Holmes. He has offered additional info on
  request.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Dave, with that DISKML file being Tim's it should be
  straight poop and he'll be the first to want to know if it is wrong in any
  way.
(DaveW.) OK. I'll check it out again. I had some of the original info provided
 by Corbitt and it no longer appears to work. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See also the extensive BASIC? files by Ekdom in DL 5 ifn' ya
  h'ain't already done so.

(Bill S.) M600??? I lead a sheltered life.  Quick des. pls.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The Tandy 600 is described in the file TRS600.PRD in database
  DL 6. In brief, t'is a 9.5 pound laptop with 224K RAM capacity [standard is
  32K] and built in disk drive for 3.5 disks.
  Regret to report that you will be UNABLE to use cassette with it!!!
  [tee hee]
