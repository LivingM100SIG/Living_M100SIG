
(LARRY R.) Good morning!

(Tony Anderson) Good morning, Larry.

(LARRY R.) Got yer msg.   Just bought TDD2, should not leave it ON while
  trying to log on, however.  I about freaked out when I did THAT this AM!

(Sysop Tony) What did it do?

(LARRY R.) It would not do anything after entering the TERM mode, CTRL-C
  would not "thaw" this freeze but F8 worked.  I had to re-enter my STAT line,
  but it worked and voici moi!

(Sysop Tony) Oh, THAT! ....
  Yes, that's always been a problem with the TDD, too; when you access the
  disk, it changes the STAT, and doesn't change it back. So that hasn't been
  fixed with the new one, huh?

(LARRY R.) Well, the screen showed correct stats re-entering them was
  something I did in a desperation!

(Sysop Tony) Interesting....  Follow up on that, and see if you can figure it
out.  May be a bug in the new DOS.

(LARRY R.) I am using a 6 volt DC charger which I used with my CCR-82 tape
  recorder to power my TDD2, but whenever I save to the disk the low-power
  lamp comes on... any guesses???

(Sysop Tony) Probably the DC charger doesn't provide enough current.  The
  power supply used with the Model 100 drives the original TDD fine.

(Larry L) Yes..Larry.. It sounds like the charger doesn't supply enough
  current.  Most disk drives use a lot of current when writing.  You might want
  to find out the current and add about 50% to get the current output needed to
  be supplied by the charger.

(LARRY R.) The book gives a catalog number of TRS charger it recommends,
  however the clerk said and apparently was mistaken, that the one I use on the
  recorder would work... I'll swing by RS today and buy the one listed in the
  book!  Thanx!

(Sysop Tony) Yes... Apparently the clerk was misinformed (grin).

(Larry L) The charger for the M100 is the highest output 6V charger they
  sell.  That should do it.

(LARRY R.) Is there a danger of too much power on 6 volt charger into drive?

(Larry L) No Larry,  the rating is the most current that the unit can supply. 
  Each load will only draw the current it needs.

(Sysop Tony) OK for now, Larry?

(LARRY R.) Back to basic E for me!  Thanx!!!

(Leonard) I've got a couple simple questions for you first off, was the
  filename you suggested phntip.005?  second, do we have a dvi tip series?

(Sysop Tony) Don't recall which phone tip number I suggested.  I'd have to go
  look how many are already there.... and Yes, there is a DVITIP series.

(Leonard) ok..  thanks, (I'm writing the file even as we 'speak')

(Sysop Tony) "Even as we speak"???

(Leonard) sure, I'm using a terminal... and writing on one of the 100's.

(Sysop Tony) Ah ha!  OK.  Anything more, Leonard?

(Leonard) oh yeah...  I heard from an rs sales rep that the 600 is on 'sold out
  when gone' status. Also saw a TD2.

(Sysop Tony) Yes... that was reported on the message board.  Don't know if it's
  true or not.  Usually they go on a where is as is sale, but I saw an ad
  in the paper this week advertising the 600's for $799.  So I'd not be
  surprised to see them vanish.

(STUART R.) HI-I GOTTA GO BACK TO EUROPE. CAN I USE MY BUILT IN MODEM
  OVER THERE ?

(Sysop Tony) Yes and no....  There is one communication service over there
  that accepts 300 baud US signals, and the Model 100 will work with that. 
  GO CSCNET for info from CompuServe on that.  But for most locations, you will
  need a CCITT standard modem which is not compatible at 300 baud, but IS at
  1200 baud.  Best bet is to buy a 300/1200 baud modem, as an upgrade here,
  and use the 1200 baud capability over there.

(Larry L)  There is an untried and undocumented method of converting the
  M100 to CCITT use.  By changing the pins on the modem chip you can
  convert to CCITT frequencies.  It would entail lifting two pins on the
  modem chip and soldering two wires.

(Sysop Tony) Yes... reportedly that has been done by several Australian
  members... but it does require a hardware modification and would have to
  be changed back again, when coming back to the US.  There was a company
  in Germany who had a conversion kit for sale.  We had a file in DL13 with
  their address but their modification was switchable so you could use either.

(Larry L) Yes... All that is being done is alternately tying one of two pins
  to 5V or ground.  Putting in a switch would be VERY easy and VERY cheap.

(Leonard) there is more than just adding a switch. You have to change an
  *external* (to the modem chip) filter network too... otherwise performance
  is *lousy*.

(Sysop Tony) OK...
  Any follow up, Stuart?

(STUART R.) I probably will just buy an external modem when i get there

(GENE NESTRO) Tony, is there any info on replacing Nicads on the M100?  DL1
  maybe?

(Sysop Tony) Well... if you mean on the "care and feeding of nicads", there is
  a file called NICADS.ART in DL7. Or on installing them in a 100, RECHRG.100
  or RECHRG.200, or RECHRG.102,too...  what exactly did you need to know?

(GENE NESTRO) My 100 won't recharge

(Sysop Tony) OK,  it's not clear if you are talking about nicads you put into
  the computer or the internal nicads that hold the memory content.  Clarify?

(GENE NESTRO) The 100 will not recharge & I can't use it as a port.

(Sysop Tony) That didn't respond to the question...  Are you saying your 100
  will not recharge nicads?  The computer never did recharge nicads unless
  you modified it.

(GENE NESTRO) Memory content is OK. The 100 won't
  maybe I need new Nicads???

(Sysop Tony) Possibly....
  but also, it could be that they are not making good contact in the battery
  compartment.  Check the springs, and test each battery out of the computer
  with a meter.

(GENE NESTRO) Will do thanks...I'm currently setting local Police Depts
  with Cellular Phones & the 102 for instant "original reports" etc

(Sysop Tony) OK... interesting project.
  Did you know about Lenny Leedy and the Florida police groups using the 100?
  He has posted some files here.

(GENE NESTRO) Yes , I worked with St. Peterrburg, Tampa, Ft. Laureldale & L.A.
  depts.  How do I search (command) for m for Lenny's programs?

(Sysop Tony) I don't have his PPN handy, but I'd guess that S/KEY POLICE might
  find it/them in DL4.

(R Caley)   ok...  quick question...
  what is fastest way to send files from one m-100 to another without cassette?

(Sysop Tony) Reliably, at 9600 baud through the RS-232 port.  Know how?

(R Caley) do you have to have a special cable?

(Sysop Tony) Well, Either a null modem cable, or a regular cable with a null
  modem adapter.  There is a file in DL9 which tells how to build one yourself.

(R Caley) thanx...I can use my Disk+ cables.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Then you simply go into text on both machines, and on the one
  you want to receive the file, you press F2, and type COM:87I1E (ENTER)....
  and on the one you are sending from, press F3, and type COM:87I1E, and press
  ENTER.

(GENE NESTRO) I use 98N1E (com:98N1E) is your stat setting better?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, Gene it is, 87 doesn't affect the calendar, whereas 98 will.
  However, 87 will also allow you to transfer BASIC files from machine to
  machine.

(GENE NESTRO) thnkx really appreciate that !!!

(Leonard) I was just going to ask about the 87 & mention Basic.  I *would*
  suggest 88 not 87 for transfers between 100's, that way you don't lose any
  grphics/foriegn/whatever characters.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, the 87 does work in BASIC, because the transfer is in
  ASCII, not tokens.  But you are correct about the graphic and foreign
  characters.  Seldom think about those, since we seldom use them here. But for
  that, 88 would be better.

(Sysop Tony)  Did you have something else, Leonard?

(Leonard) Yeah, just got a weird msg on the other line (I had to log with the
  100 to check a msg). Just for the heck of it after checking the msg, I tried
  to enter the CO (would have made me 'twins'). Got a  "job limit exceeded"
  msg???

(Sysop Tony) Yes...  Users are only allowed to have one job number in CO
  under the same PPN. .... Sysops are excepted from that since we need to make transcripts.

(Leonard) Aha! Special privileges!  I guess you guys work hard enough to
  justify them <grin>

(Sysop Tony) Yes... well, ...  you don't notice it now, but I have two jobs
  running now, one for the transcript.  You can't see that.

(Leonard) ok, I kinda figured it was something like that.

(Sysop Tony) OK... take a look at the UST 18 now, and you can see the
  transcript being made.

(Leonard) yep..

(Sysop Tony) And now it's gone.

(Leonard) in fact I'd *just* done a ust to check on don's ppn!

(Sysop Tony) Well, it looks like we have lots of new folks here. How do you
  folks like the later starting time?

(Larry L) 12 is a little late for us on the East coast, but I guess if it could
  bring in more Left coasters it's fine with me.

(Sysop Tony) (LEFT??) Problem was, 8 am was too early on the West Coast.
  would an evening CO be better?  If so when?

(Larry L)  I have to get up very early so evening (9PM) are too late for me.

(john k) well... eve would be rough for  either west or east depending...
  this new time is great!

(Sysop Tony) one suggstion was that we start at 8 AM on the East coast....
  and let it run til 10 on the West!  (gag)....

(Leonard) I was just a bit surprised this morning, I got up at 8:30 and
  expected to have missed 1/2 hour of the CO. Then I get here and found
  *nobody*. (then I saw the notice...). I do like the later time though. Dunno
  about evening.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah... Saturday nite in Oregon is real tough!  (grin)  8:30
  indeed! ... 

(Larry L) Is this new time permanant?

(Sysop Tony) Well... not really. ....  If we find most folks would prefer an
  evening CO, we'd probably change.  But it won't be set back to the old time
  for a while.  That time was for Dave's convenience, and I'll be doing the
  CO's from now on.

(Larry L) [where is dave]

(Sysop Tony) Dave has accepted a contract with another service, and will no
  longer be sysoping here. We expect to see him from time to time, but not
  in an official capacity.

(Larry L) [we'll miss him]

(Jon Payne) What! sysop ^Dave^ is gone? Say it ain't so!

(Sysop Tony) Yes, he's gone.  Hasn't been here since last Sunday.

(FALCETTA) AM NEW TO FORUM...NEW TO COMPUSERVE..
  NEW TO COMPUTERS...SO NEW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK ANYTHING

(Sysop Tony) OK... First off, you're typing in all capital letters....
  Do you have your CAPS LOCK key down?

(FALCETTA) YES off now. i assume ga is like radio command for "over"

(Sysop Tony) Yes... That's better.  Yes, "ga" means, "I am done, you can go
  ahead". ga Falcetta, you have the floor. ga

(FALCETTA) tnx  what hardware do i need to dowload from Forum files pls.

(Sysop Tony) You can download with nothing more than your computer
  To capture anything that you are receiving all you have to do is press the
  F2 button, and give a file name. But... We have prepared a file on that
  subject, which provides greater detail than we can in this conference
  situation. To read the file, type the letter B at the main menu function
  prompt (where you can read or leave messages) and press the ENTER key. At
  the next menu, type the number 4 and press ENTER to read the file. Suggest
  you echo a copy to your printer for later review. (Turn on Printer and
  press F5 button)  OK?

(FALCETTA) have printer on now, thank you. i don't know what Protocol with
  which to respond

(Sysop Tony) The Model 100 group uses the "Capture" protocol, Also called
  DC2/DC4.  OK?

(FALCETTA) tnx. will try

(David H. Hawes) Tony, How do I unprompt press <cr>for more

(Sysop Tony) GO DEFAULT, and set your page length to zero.  That should stop
  the prompts. However, some things are interlinked, so check the file
  DEFALT.HLP in DL1.

(David H. Hawes) thanks

(john k) ok....  just out of interest, Tony, do you sign a "contract"
  with Compuserve?

(Sysop Tony) If you mean me, specifically, no. There is a contract holder,
  who provides the forum service to CompuServe, and who does have a contract
  with them.  In our case, it's Wayne Day, who is the primary sysop.   Each
  Primary can contract for services as needed.  Wayne and I do not have a
  contract, only a mutual agreement.

(john k) interesting, tnx.

(Leonard) What's "the life of a sysop" like?

(Sysop Tony) Lots of behind-the-scenes work to supporting a forum. ...
  Most members don't see, or are aware of the hours we put in researching
  answers, writing files, updating index and catalog files, reviewing, testing, and merging new files; it's virtually a full-time 
job.

(Leonard) that's about what I figured...  I've done some asst sysop work on a
  couple of local boards. Extrapolating from that, I can guess what it must be
  like. Thought it would be nice to have it 'on the record' as it were.

(Sysop Tony) Thanks for that! Working on an International BBS (essentially), is
  much more work than local BBS's, just by the sheer scope of it.  Most BBS's
  deal with one person at a time, and have maybe 50 or 60 signons.... a day. 
  We have that in ten minutes or so, on a busy day.

(Leonard) [try 100-200!]

(Sysop Tony) Another difference is the number of simultaneous users we can
  have on at the same time. And the size of the database is another point.
  I consider local BBS's as a "small world" CompuServe, and good training
  for moving up.  (grin)

(Leonard) At least you don't have problems with "anonymous twits"! That is
  a major problem on local boards. That and would be "hackers" (proper term is
  "cracker"!)

(Sysop Tony) Well here, they "twit" once, and get a warning... "twit" twice,
  and they're history!  I'm glad to see you differentiate between hackers and
  crackers.  I'm a long-time hacker, from back in the early days of personal
  computers and resent the press's use of the word "hacker" to describe
  irresponsible twits!  Fortunately, we don't have many on CompuServe.
  ...for very long, anyway.

(Leonard) Well, *knowing* for CERTAIN the identities of users helps a lot. And
  paying money tends to increase the proportion of responsible users.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I agree...

(David H. Hawes) For DBNEW... how do you use 10k files?  I have dp100

(Sysop Tony) I'm not familiar with DBNEW, so can't offer much advice. ....
  but it's likely that the program wasn't designed for use with very large
  files, since the Model 100 group doesn't have that much RAM space to begin
  with.  It's possible the program could be converted for use with one of the
  disk drives, but that's beyond me. ... Have you tried sending a message to
  the author of the program yet?

(David H. Hawes) yes. It was originally for the DVI and he didnt have any ideas

(Sysop Tony) Well... If it worked with the DVI, then it would work with the
  Chipmunk, since that uses the same commands.   And it should work with the
  TDD, if the program accesses the file data sequentially.  None of the TDD
  DOS's can open more than one file, though. ... don't know if that's a
  problem or not.  Also, only TS-RANDOM from Traveling Software supports random
  access. ... don't know if THAT's a problem either.

(David H. Hawes) thats probably it! thanks!

(PETER) I can not get the Model 600 to hook up with the phone.  It gets the
  carrier tone and then nothing.

(Sysop Tony) OK... the 600 is not a user friendly computer at all!  the TELCOM program is very, very complex, and
  difficult to use correctly. ....  the manual is wrong on several points.
  We have five files in DL11 that detail, step by step, how to get TELCOM
  working. Have you read those?

(PETER) yes... I've been thru the script file redoing the set-up many times.

(Sysop Tony) OK... if you follow those steps exactly, it should work for
  you.... If it doesn't, then there's something wrong, and I can't divine what
  it is... You should take it to the store, and see if they can help you set it
  up.

(PETER) - thank you for this & prior help

(David Edwards) I once asked if anyone had had any problems with the spell
  checker, using Powr-Dos. I had to do  a cold start twice and am wondering
  what is happenning.

(Sysop Tony) Although I was actively involved in creating the spelling checker
  programs... I have the impression that relatively few people are actually
  using it.  And must admit, that I don't use it much, either.

(David Edwards) [it is time comsuming]

(Sysop Tony) There seem to be even fewer users of POWR-DOS, since it's only
  been available for a few months.  No one has connected the two, that I
  know of... except you.  It has been mentioned that POWR-DOS is different than
  POWR-DISK,.. which does work, fine.  (I have POWR-DISK and TS-DOS myself).
  But I can't figure out what doesn't work with your combination, without
  having POWR-DOS to test it.  Sorry. ...
  I don't even know what to recommend, other than posting a "Help" message on
  the bulletin board.

(David Edwards) Insperation!!!!!!!! Spell checker has a programm that uses
  machine languge I bet that is the problem. it is used to convert the data
  file into a file that the program can use.

(Sysop Tony) Possible. ... You may have to reload or reactivate POWR-DOS after
  running DCPREP.  Although I had the impression that DCPREP relocated in
  high memory under HIMEM. I thought POWR-DOS loaded in low memory, so HIMEM
  wasn't involved.  But DCPREP may destroy some hooks that POWR-DOS uses.

(David Edwards) When I go to Powr-dos after DCPREP is when I get the errors so
  it must be the hooks as you say.  Also what you said about mem locations is
  as I understand it also... I will have to study what is happening... now that
  I think I know where it is.

(Sysop Tony) OK... good.  Let me know what you find. We may need a tip file
  on that one.

(Sysop Tony) OK folks, that about does it for this week. .... Thanks for
  coming. Stick around and talk if you like.  END OF CO
