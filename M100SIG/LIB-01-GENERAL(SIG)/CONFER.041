(Sysop .^Dave^.) Flint?? What is Hard Engineering ??
(FLINT) I thought they were the company that put out the chipmunk disk drive.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) You want PCSG that sells it, Holmes Engineering makes it.
  PCSG representative here is Mike Anders 70526,1715 but he cannot accept
  orders. PCSG telephone number 214-351-0564 in Dallas, Texas

(Doug M.) I have a question about Powr-D. Which I am enjoying immensely,
 But am wondering about the "insert" Function of loading directly to text.
 With my version it always APPENDS rather than inserting at the cirsor.
 Is this the case with others?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I don't have P-D program because I don't have the Tandy disk
  drive, but there are supporting files for you in DL 2 that may address the
  problem. Also in DL 5 there is a LOT of TDD stuff, some of which is directly
  related to POWR-DISK and FINALLY, do you have Acroatix User ID to ask them?
(Doug M.) Yes, I asked, but I went away on a trip and by the time I got back
 I think their reply had scrolled off. Will have to try them again.
 I just though somenone here today might have the same "problem" though it can
 hardly be called that.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, someone may pick up on your question from the transcipt
 and help you out. Phil Wheeler is pretty savvy on that stuff.

(john k) "FENIX", my favorite game, scrolls uncontrollably after first game.
 anybody fixed it yet?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, Seem to bermember some sort of problem. My copy works
  just fine, but I don't bermember what I did. Have you looked to see if
  current copy has a date more recent than what you downloaded? Patch?
(john k) downloaded anew just last week and the bug is still there.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) know that it is a simple fix, I'll see if I can look at the
  code and bermember what is involved. Leave a message on the board to
  'All' and maybe sumbaudee else will help first.


(Mel S.) Thanks... some questions re SuperRom and Powr-D. Has anybody figured
 out how to save formatted files driectly from the M200/100 to the TDD?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mel, have neither SuperRom nor the POWR-D so I can't help,
  but perhaps a transcript reader will be able to and the message board might
  be a good place to leave a call for help too.
(Mel S.) Yes. I appreciate your help. The two roms (UR2 and Super) are really
 great products -- wish the two designers had collaborated, because each..
 has some very fine points. One is not better than the other. Different.


(DAVID E) I JUST TRIED MY VERSION OF POWER-D FOR THE EARLYEIR PROBLEM AND HAD
 THE SAMETHING HAPPEN.  SO I AM ALSO INTERESRESTED IN THE SOLUTION WHEN ON
 COMES. PLEASE PUT IT ON THE MESS BOARDS.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) David, thanks for report but, unless you are vision impaired
  could you please use lower case?? On the message board too, your all capital
  letters hurts my eyes, and many others too.
(DAVID E) agreed sorry
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Whew!! Thankee muchee !!


(JeffG) Just received Carl Oppendahl's book "Inside the Model 100"
 I think it's superb, and I recommend it to anyone who really wants to learn
 more about their Model 100.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Thanks Jeff, from publisher or did you get at a store?
(JeffG) Ordered from the publisher-- Weber Systems, Inc.  8437 Mayfield rd.
 Chesterland, Ohio 44026
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, and their phone number is 800-851-6018
  my copy came direct from Carl a few weeks ago. Been so busy programming
  Mortie 600 that I've not had time to test some of Carl's routines.
  Interesting ...


(Mel S.) Next question: anyone found a good, highly regulated 6-volt supply
 that we could run ALL our toys from at once -- eg, TDD, M200, printer --
 without overload? The big 1.1 amp type 6-volt wall units bother me because
 I have measured them at 8-9 volts output with no load...and the M100/200
 don't draw very much in the compute/type modes...so theoretically, we're
 probably pushing our luck to power off them. Any ideas?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mel, that sounds like the kinda stuff that is right down the
  alleys of Tony Anderson, rowlfe, and Denny Thomas none of whom are here right
  now!! That hardware clunking is beyond me. I'm lucky to find the on/off
  switches on my silicon family!!
(Mel S.) In theory, all that should be necessary is one of those 3-legged
 regulator chips, with a resistor in series with the ground lead to change the
 output from 5 to 6 volts...but I don't know how to compute the right
 resistance. Then, all you would do is plug a big wall-pack into one side,
 and power everything off that. It's very do-able -- and would make a fine
 project for the SIG...before someone blows something. I'm leaving for Rome and
 Vienna this Pm with 2 220 wall units because of being afraid of powering off
 the 1 amp unit.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Please say hello to the Ringestrasse for me; my favourite
  city, Vienna. And with any luck, Tony will pick up on your questions and
  prepare one of his tip files on how to make what you need with a box of tooth
  picks and paper clips. enjoy ...
  Europing the 100 way  ....


(JeffG) I just wanted to thank you, Dave. Last week you tried to give me some
 advice about accessing the Chipmunk via machine language.  Well, upon
 browsing the data library I found a very good piece written by a fellow from
 PCSG. So, thanks for steering me to the DL. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yea, gnu there was a M/L reference there but couldn't remember
  or find the filename. Did you find CHIPMK.CAT in the DL 5?
(JeffG) yes... It was helpful.


(PETER T) Tnx Dave, I am looking for a M/L routine in the 100 that switches to
 the option ROM. I guess it obviously is copyed into ram before execution.
 Does anybody know where and also the code to switch back again to the regular
 ROM?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks you misunderstand. Though it depends on the ROM,
  generally it is not copied into RAM and NONE of them replace the ROM that is
  in the 100 but regularly make use of the 100 ROM. Turning on the optional ROM
  is by different methods. Many of us thought, at first, that CALL 63012 was
  the only way to activate the additional ROM chips, but have since found that
  there are other addresses used too. Some are turned off with  CALL 63012,0,1
  but not all.
(PETER T) Yeah ... I am programming my own ROM. I need to trnsfer to it then
 execute it and transfer back to the regular ROM. will that second call do the
 trick?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That depends entirely on how you program the ROM, that second
  CALL is used by PCSG but I don't believe it is used by Traveling or Polar,
  but I'm not sure.
(JeffG) I think that the first call you gave, Dave, causes the cpu to use the
 optional ROM socket (M11) for addresses 0000 - 7FFF.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks (still) that it depends on the programming. Just used
  CALL 63012 with Ultimate II ROM installed and was bounced from Basic to the
  Menu; thats all. (I hope!)
(PETER T) YEAH... WELL IF I USE A JUMP TO 63012 TO BRING IN THE OPTION ROM
 THATS FINE. IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING BACK THEN THERE MUST BE
 CODE COPYED INTO HIMEM SOMEWHERE FOR THE RETURN JUMP. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU
 WOULD know what or where the return code is. Just any information would help!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I just don't know NUTT'N except that 63012 turns the Write ROM
  on and that 63012 has no effect on Ultimate II ROM.
  that 63012,0,1 turns Write ROM off and has no effect on Ultimate II ROM.
  I know NUTT'N about ROM programming.
(JeffG) Peter, resetting the machine with a cold start will restore the
 original ROM. <not a good solution, I know..>
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't understand "restore original ROM" It ain't turned off!!
  Is it?
(JeffG) No, but the CPU expects ROM from address 0000 to 7FFF.
(PETER T) It is switched out Dave.... It is not addressed the option rom is addressed instead. .
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, you are telling me that when Write ROM is in use the 8K
  there replaces the 32K ROM in the Model 100; very interesting trick.
(JeffG) I may be getting in over my head, but I believe that write ROM must be
 a full 32k of ROM. I suppose it mimicks much of what is in the M100 ROM
  provided by Microsoft.
(PETER T) code at 63012... performs a DI,MVIa-01,OUT232, and a restart0...
 a call 63012 again will do the trick...

(clay davis) I have been away from the sig for a while and have lost touch.
 Did the Sig reorganioze?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) How so do you mean "reorganize" ?
  Subjects?? Personnel?? Data Library??  Huh? Huh??
(clay davis) Well when I logged in i had to go back and rejoin the sig
(Sysop .^Dave^.) clay, folks that don't access the SIG for three consecutive
  months get dropped. Just a housekeeping process, that is all otherwise we'd
  have 50,000 names cluttering the memory banks.


(Curtis G) HOW MANY ACTIVE MEBERS ARE IN THE SIG?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Depends on how you define "active"
(Curtis G) That have signed on in the last month..
(Sysop .^Dave^.) we carry around 5,000 on a regular basis.


(Fred S.) I have a q. about the RAMs for 100/200. Are they really worth the
 cost of about 89 or so, or could you make your own with cheaper chips??
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, I gather you mean the regular 8K for the 100 and such,
  not the 96K or 64K expansion. The 8K for the 100 commonly sell for $25 or so,
  with 3 for $70 or so and I'm certain that do it yourself wouldn't be worth it
  because the chip needs a mounting board too ...
(JeffG) Purple Computing has an ad in the latest Portable 100/200/300
 8K modules-- $29; 3 8K modules for $79.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Right Jeff, but there are less expensive vendors too
(Fred S.) I was talking bout the 89 ones for the model 200. the chips only cost
 about 2.50 or so. I have purchsed them for the 100, but the 200 price is
 rediculous and it makes me mad to not have an alternative to the Node price
 even.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sorry Fred, know of no do-it-yourself for those,
  only for 32k expansion for the 100.


(Robert Woeger) I'm using a 100, but am very interested in the 600
 Does anyone out there know much about BASIC ROM for 600?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) believe that there are few people that know more (other than
  Tandy/Microsoft) about the 600 Basic programming other than myself. there are
  over two dozen progrms for the 600 in the Data Library, most of which were
  written by me or adapted by me for the 600. Suggest that you use the command:
  RS;S;600;0 to see what has been said lately on the message board 
  and then in the databases use the command:
  BRO/KEY 600 for file descriptions.
(Robert Woeger) I am really interested in the 600s lack of Random file I/O
 and the problem of using WORD to send control characters to an EPSON prtr.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Huh??? Whacha mean by no random file I/O ???
(Robert Woeger) THey said NO! No random file support says R/S.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, I'm an amateur programmer at very best and I'm working
  my programs without accessing the disk since that seems like a waste of time
  when you've got 118K RAM on board. Using DBCALLS.LIB to access the FILE
  program is most certainly random access [I think].
(Robert Woeger) You might be right. All I know is what they told me
 on the R/S hotline in Fort Worth.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I'm sitting here with the 600 Basic Manual with explanations
  of use of GET "Reads a record from a random file into a random buffer."
  My experience with Tandy and the 600 is that they don't know. anything.
(Robert Woeger) That's really encouraging news! The main reason I didn't buy
 a 600 was that fact. I can't believe that the hotline told me wrong.
(JeffG) <I can>
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Robert, if you want to voice me in 30 minutes, I can do
  better. Ok?
(Robert Woeger) I wished that the store had the 600 BASIC in stock, but they
 didn't.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not a stock item. I've programmmed the 600, Tandy hasn't.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Want my phone number Robert?
(Robert Woeger) Yes, please.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) 301-252-5379 and I'll be available in 30 minutes.
(Robert Woeger) I'll give you a call


(JeffG) Re the 600. What CPU does it use? (not 80C85?) 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, 80C88 but at only 3.07 MHz.
(JeffG) That's interesting. Thanks. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Someone has suggested sticking a Z-20 into it for speed and
  improved performance. Beyond me!!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hello dere Tony, see that Denny has put out the first PR on
  the next LAUGH meeting. Is the Goodyear blimp rented yet?
(Sysop Tony) A little premature, I think. Blimp not available.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [sulk]
(Sysop Tony) But NBC will cover it.  (grin)
 Wavering between Hollywood and Shermaks locations; not firm yet.
 Still 6 weeks away.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Where will ABC and CBS get in?? What's a Shermak?
(Sysop Tony) ABC and CBS refused to meet our price.
 Shermak = Sherman Oaks + line noise
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Be advised that I've accepted Rick Mendosa's invitation and
  will be attending Santa Barbara re-timed meeting since very few of them will
  be able to go south. Phil and I will drive up and I'll fly out of Santa
  Barbara Sunday afternoon.
(JeffG) <sounds really gnarly!>
(Sysop .^Dave^.) What's a "gnarly" ? Talking 'bout my trip west from Maryland.
(Sysop Tony) uh huh... they wouldn't drive 100 miles to see you or the LA group
(Dana Ross) I'm from L.A., tell me about this trip.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) On 16-May I'm out to L.A. and will be attending L.A. meeting
  on 17th and Santa Barbara meeting on 18th then off to Seattle, Bremerton,
  Tacoma area.
(Dana Ross) Where are these meetings? I have my appt. book out.
 Addresses? I'm interested.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony!! Get that PPN !!!
(Sysop Tony) Yes, I'll pass it on to Denny.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony, he's coming in from Long Beach.
  and Dick Brumley is coming in from Torrance!!  GET 'M !!
(Sysop Tony) We'll advise them both.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Watch out, we may need the coliseum [or whatever ya call it
  out there.]
(Sysop Tony) Well, we would have if Santa Barbara had decided to come down and
 join us. San Diego group will be coming up.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Was just about to ask about the San Diego crowd.
  You get hold of Steve Zimmerman and his ZP-150?
(Sysop Tony) The SB folks are such snobs. Steve is arranging a carpool.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) How much of your SB comments do I edit out?
(Sysop Tony) None. There has always been a Santa Barbara- L:A rivalry.
 They disdain LA.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oh, ho! Glad to hear that; thought Tony was sulking.
  Steve, by the way, likes my CHECKS.600 very much indeed.
  Nice to know someone does!
(Dana Ross) Excuse my intrusion, but, Where will this L.A. meeting be held?
 And can I come? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Dana!! You'll hurt my feelings if you don't show up!!
(Sysop Tony) Dana, you will receive invitation, telling you where, and how to
 get there. LA meeting will start at 2 PM, and go into a dinner at a
 nearby restaurant.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay folks; end of this chattering.
  all go to Yak-yak mode which = free for all.
  Thankee for coming along.
