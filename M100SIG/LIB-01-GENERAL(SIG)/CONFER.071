(TEX ALDREDGE) I GOT ME A 100 LAST WEEK AND LOVE IT ANLONG WITH MY 4 COCO'S
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, you'll find there is a LOT of super programs available
  here on the SIG for your Model 100.
(TEX ALDREDGE) I ALREADY DONLOADED TPIX AND IT MAKIES THE 100 DOWNOD WEA MPS
BETTE THAN THE COCO
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good, glad you're finding your way around.


(LARRY L) are the m100 and nec made by the same manuf?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes Larry; they are both, and the Olivetti M-10 too, made by
Kyocera Ltd. of Japan.


(TEX ALDREDGE) how do you set m100 to insert lf a end of line
(Sysop .^Dave^.) For your line feed problems see LFUTL.PW1 in DL 4 with
  documentation in LFUTL.DES and LFUTL.INF ....


(LARRY L) [where is everyone?]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I think that too many people are off to the beaches and
  mountains without their Model 100 et alia. It was very quite last week too.
(LARRY L) No, they are all here in Manhatten
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The poor things!


(TEX ALDREDGE) dave i could not find file
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Which one Tex?? the LFUTL files??
(TEX ALDREDGE) lfutl.pw1
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmm,,,, they are in DL 4.
  What command did you use to find them?
(TEX ALDREDGE) down
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Down is not correct and needs paramenters anyway.
(TEX ALDREDGE) then when it ask for file name lfutl.pw1
(Sysop .^Dave^.) In DL 4 use the command R LFUTL.PW1 and set your computer up
  for downloading BEFORE pressing the ENTER key. Bulletin #4 contains ESSENTIAL
  information on downloading with the Model 100 and should be read by even the
  most experienced computer folks using the Model 100 for the first time.


(Gary D.) Back in my phone booth in Syracuse. Downloaded new TICTAC.100 from
 DL3; seems to be a bunch of data "missing" from lines 910 and 920.
 Anybody else notice this?
(LARRY L) yes; downloaded it a little while ago and there seems to be about 15
 data groups missing from those lines.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oh me &*%$#@ sysops around here!!!!
  Guess I'll have to pull it until I can track down that Quebecois that
  uploaded it. No checksum was provided and I broke my rules and merged it even
  so because it LOOKED okay. If'n ya follow me.
(LARRY L) [yup]
(Gary D.) Sho does.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not in the habit of counting DATA statements!!
(Gary D.) I thought my download was somehow wrong!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, if you did the checksum you gawt what I gawt but we
  don't have the author's report on that. Francois Demers; don't know how much
  English in hand.
(Sysop Tony) Seems I recall there was already a tic-tac-toe type of game in the
 database, but for some reason, it had a very obscure file name... might be
 worth a look for keywords. [Editor: NTCRS.BA]
(Gary D.) I already just happened to have it with me on disk and checked it,
 but it's an entirely different program; uses no data statements, so no way to
 cross reference.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gary, you just get that DATA statements figgered out and let
  us know!!
(Gary D.) I'll try....already have 910 done but 920 is a real problem and,
 remember, I'm supposed to be on vacation fishing!.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Might as well fish for tics and toes!
(Sysop Tony) (Getting any bytes?)  (groan)
(LARRY L) aarrgghh
(Gary D.) Yes, fish are biting so well it's like being in a "forever" for-next
 loop!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) In that case you need to relax and compute tac DATA anyway !
(Sysop Tony) (tackey!)
(LARRY L) gary..what are those two lines for?
(Gary D.) 910 is the one that figures out if someone won and "draws" the proper
 line. Missing segment is for squares 3,5, and 7.
 920 is the one that "tells" the computer what move to make with so much
 missing you can always beat it, of course!
(LARRY L) sounds like a good problem.
(Gary D.) For you..... not for me......
(Sysop .^Dave^.) maybe with those pointers sumbaudee can figure it out before
  we get hold of Francois.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, have you heard of any ROM testing of the Model 102 as
  yet? that is, LUCID or SUPER running in the Model 102?
(Mike A.) I've just heard that 5 Model 102's came in to the office and that
 Micheal Stanford and other programmers have been playing with 'em. I've been
 told the ROMs work fine and they even got a Chipmunk working.
 Now, it's onto the hardware mods for the ROM Bank and the 128K RAM board.  
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, thanks for the report and gnus. My local RSCC is to let
  me know pronto and I'll do thorough testing of various programs that include
  machine code as well as simple INP and OUT  Basic stuff.


(Rich W.) Mikle essentially answered by question on what is likelyhood of
 extended ram banks for 102?
(Mike A.) Seems inevitable since Tandy's stopped making 100's, so we'll just
 have to go with the outboard buss. it may be a side benefit for 200 owners,
 but I'm not sure on that.
(Rich W.) Might that mean 96k ram in the 6 rom bank?
(Mike A.) Sounds good to me ! but I really don't think they've settled on a
 final design yet.
(LARRY L) if I may suggest...a module that would go on the back. like the rom
 bank but without legs.
(Mike A.) Right. I've described it as sort of a NEC sidecar lookalike.
 we're thinkin' on the same wavelength here.
(LARRY L) keep the shape of the computer..right.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good luck on coming up with sump'n that doesn't look all
  glujjed up and pasted together!!
(Mike A.) It gives the ROM Bank Character, Dave..


(Rich W.) As long as no one has anythiong pressing, just wonder if anyone has
 thoughts on why all other manufacturers seem to have abandoned lightwieght
 portable market to Tandy, when they are only ones making $$ on it??
 Seems crazy!
(LARRY L) i think that the "big boys" feel that if they cant make multi
 millions on a product it isnt worth making. the number of people who really
 need to use their computer on the run is limited. until the concept of the
 electronic notebook really takes off.
(Sysop Tony) One of the software companies that supports both the Model 100
 group and the IBM market has stated that they make more $$$ in a week from the
 IBM compatible market than they do all year from the portable market.
(Rich W.) what dopesn't make sense is they are all in the portable market,
 but with portables that don't make sense. they cost too much for an 'extra'
 machine and are too limited for an 'only machione.
 that's what makes the 100 great.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, and many folks definition of "portable" is way off of
  mine, and I think that of most of us here.
(LARRY L) the people in large comps that buy computers tend to have the same
 requirements of a portable that they have of a desktop.
(Rich W.) Is that really true? Or is it a misyunderstanding of the
 possibilities of a 100-like machine?
(LARRY L) both..they usually want the machine to do too much.  also they must
 do MSDOS and have large memory. They really want a desktop unit on their laps.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Any portable computer MUST have non-volatile RAM like the 100,
  200 and 600 as the absolute minimum starting place.
(Rich W.) If PIC can do CPM, why can't they (or someone) do MS-DOS?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Probably a matter of "Patience else patients"
  Mike?? comments??
(Mike A.) Huh ?  you mean a 100 doing MS DOS ?
(Rich W.) There is actually very little need for the 100 to do MS-Dos.
(LARRY L) [righton!]
(Rich W.) for most work, if you can transfer easily (like xtel, disk++...
 my only complaint is not being to transfer lucid files into lotus which i
 assume would bug corporate types.
(Mike A.) Well, I see the IBM and true laptop worlds coming together and the
 next "breakthru" will be someone who makes MSDOS laptops behave like
 Model 100's with their main menu, etc.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Isn't the next breakthrough for portables REALLY needed in the
  power area now???
(Mike A.) Batteries ?  Aboslutely !!
 At least some kind of quick change cartridge thing like camcorders.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Wazza "camcorder" please??
(LARRY L) [dave...mini video recorder-camera]


(Mike A.) Rich, have you called PCSG for help on 1-2-3- conversions ?
(Rich W.) no..just dropped notes on the m100 bull board, without success.
(Mike A.) Oh, okay...maybe a call would be in order since I believe you're
 gonna need Disk+ to do it thr easiest.
(Rich W.) I can transfer files to PC ok. They just need some kind of conversion
 utility to be useable on 1-2-3.
(Mike A.) Right, that's where D+ takes over; might be worth a try at least.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Do I gather that the Disk+ you are speaking of isn't the same
  as the Disk+ of two years ago?? Wazza diff?
(Mike A.) Right...new one's on ROM and much improved speed/error wise.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Is that all the difference?
(Mike A.) Well, Lucid conversions and for IBM, operation over auto-answer
 modem.
(Rich W.) That sounds exciting. Strange its never been advertised as 123
 compatable
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If there is no diff in performance features I don't see how
  it could possibly help in 1-2-3 conversion etc.
  Ummmm,,, Disk+ that I know will do no more than file stuff on a PC disk for
  you ... or CoCo, or Model 4, or whatever.
(Mike A.) Maybe I'm wrong, but the technical rep, Dave Oldham, told me Disk+
 was now the only way to go on Lucid to 1-2-3 conversions. the old
 cassette-based software just never quite was up to par.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, must be a major change then because the Disk+ that I
  knew did not allow the PC to access the Model 100 files in ANY way at all.
  The PC diskette was addresssable by the Disk+ only and the stuff was unusable
  by the desktop computer. Must be different now.
(Mike A.) Only one way to find out.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No Lucidity about me, and you know that spreadsheets and I
  have no intention of shaking hands.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony, you are the power man around here. Where is the next
  major breakthrough coming in power for the portables? Do we drop one drop of
  ZylXicphas on the screen of the computer once every month?? or what??
(Sysop Tony) I think the crop of "desktop/laptops" currently on the market
 are the result of companies trying to create laptops with the same power
 and capability as the desktops; but unsuccessfully. I'd guess the next major
 step for the laptop market in general would be in the area of increased RAM
 space, since that is so CRITICAL in attempting to run any of the big buck
 programs, such as Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, etc. But closer to home, I think the
 next thing we're likely to see is the Holmes RAM bank for the Tandy 200, which
 will give the 200 users a 32K bank capability, and allow them to switch in
 MSPLAN when needed.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Holmes going to beat P.G. Designs to the punch??
(Sysop Tony) Depends. He turned the software part of the project over to PCSG,
 and they apparently put it on the back burner.
(Rob D) I think all of the mfg's have to step back and take a hard look at what
 they're trying to accomplish with portables.  There was an article some time
 ago in PICO.  An interview with David Kay of Apple and he was talking about a
 "flat Mac".  now that comes a lot closer to replacing paper in a functional
 sense than any of the current genre of mega lap portables.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks that Tony is telling me that there is no hope to be
  found in ZylXicphas after all. Wayne Green may not be perfect but he sure has
  made some portable sense.
  As much as he can't stand Tandy, he sure loves his Model 100 !!
(Sysop Tony) Yes, outrageous as some of his editorials are he certainly
 believes laptops are the best thing since hot biscuits!
 Regarding PG Design's RAM expansion, I think Peter has run into insurmountable
 problems that have contributed to continued delays in releasing his product
 and without outside help, something which he is not know to solicit, that
 expansion unit may never come to market.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) my my,  hate to do this but in fairness to paying folks ...
methinks should close the CO for today. [Closed early with four present.]
