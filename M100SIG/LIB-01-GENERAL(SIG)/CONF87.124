(Sysop Tony) Hi dere.

(Sysop Denny) Hi Tony

(Sysop Tony) Gad... sudden interest in one of my programs, CRDFIL.
  Interesting.

(Sysop Denny) Reading the message board, it looks like you got  C. Davey fired
  up.  There has long been interest in a dbase program that can work with any
   peripheral.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, but CRDFIL isn't much of a dbase-type program. ... Too
  limited.

(Sysop Denny) Well, if it even comes close, it's a major improvement
  if it can be used with the TDD or other  mass storage devices. There just
  isn't anything commercially available that works with external devices.
  Really a pain.  If Lucid Data could use 0:, it would be the best.  Very
  fast, but limited to ram available.  (not as easy to use though) The ideas
  that you have so far are very close to the  existing dbase programs.

(Phil) Hi, Tony Brry cold there, huh!

(Sysop Tony) Oh, there probably is, we just aren't familiar with it.  PCSG has
  PBASE for the Chipmunk... that could be converted but only by those who have
  a Chipmunk... then, what's the point in converting?

(Sysop Denny) That program didn't work well at all and it was amazingly slow.
  I tried using it for real work a couple of times and gave up when it would
  bomb its index file and you'd have to recreate the data files every other
  time you worked with them.

(Sysop Tony) Well as we found with the spelling programs, disk access time is
  a real limitation. Not like with big systems.

(Phil) Neat way to do the data base stuff appears  to be with TS-RANDOM.  very
  powerful and fast with TDD.  But no one uses it and it will not work with
  TDD2 as best I understand.

(Sysop Denny) Yeah, I tried that

(Eiji) [Good morning]

(Sysop Denny) and found it to be faster than the Chipmunk program  Hi Eiji!

(Phil) [Eiji, XMDPW5.200 lives!]

(Eiji) [nice to hear that, Phil]

(Phil) Yes, TS-RANDOM is nice, and I think they used it to do the disk access
  part of Sardine, which is a really fast DB program of course, the key is to
  make the driver all in M/l.  Good morning, Eiji it's really cold where Tony
  is.  How is Tokyo (assuming you are still there)

(Sysop Tony) Hmmm... Lost Denny.

(Phil) [Eiji did a C]

(Eiji) Yes, I'm in Tokyo  It's been a little warmer for last two days.  Not
  bad for winter time. ga

(Sysop Tony) (I'll bet the kid pulled his plug! grin)

(Sysop Denny) [back, got dumped]

(Phil) [wife, maybe!]

(Sysop Tony) Gene's up next, Denny.

(gene) Is there still a file on ROM calls, Peeks, & Pokes in a DL?

(Sysop Tony) (Half a dozen of them)

(Sysop Denny) Right, quite a few.  You could look at the reference cat in DL
  8 or BRO with an appropriate key to get a list.

(Sysop Tony) There are also some in DL3, and DL10.  POKES.100, POKES.200,
  TELTIP.001 (I think), CALLS.ROM, CALLS.MNU.

(gene) I thought there was a M100 MAP file

(Sysop Denny) Yep, there are 8 files concerned with the ROM map.

(Sysop Tony) (Plus those conversion tables that Phil has done)

(Sysop Denny) Check out 100ROM.RC* in DL 8

(WAYNE S.) I bought a dvi that was a display model in the store and they
  couldn't find the operating disk. How can I get one.

(Ron) Wayne. Have the dealer order you a disk from Tandy Software Assembly.
  Make sure that you specify what computer you are using. The DVI DOS for the
  100/102 is different from the 200.

(Sysop Tony) (One disk contains the programs for both the 100/102 and 200
  versions)

(WAYNE S.) ok...the salesman was suppose to send me one but he hasn't. thanks.

(R Caley) [ALRIGHT...ANOTHER DV/I FAN]

(Sysop Denny) Wayne, I would stay on top of that salesman

(WAYNE S.) (it was on sale for 199.00

(Ron) No sir! The DVI DOS for the 100/102 IS DIFFERENT from the 200

(Sysop Tony) (Different, yes. But both on the same disk)

(Ron) No sir!

(Sysop Denny) They aren't supposed to sell that stuff incomplete.

(Ron) They are on DIFFERENT disks

(Sysop Tony) Sorry Ron.  That doesn't jive with what I bought.  I have both
  machines, and the DOS for both is on the same disk.

(Ron) A 100 DVI DOS on a 200 will send you to the North Pole.

(Sysop Tony) Of course  But the machine can tell which computer it's hooked
  to,  and load the correct DOS from the disk into the machine.

(R Caley) Probably behind the times  but Greg Susong sold me one of his
  DV/I's  because Tandy had not completed the promised DOS at least at that
  time....but they WOULD be different.

(Sysop Tony) Of course they are different
  That's not the point.  The point is, that the DVI comes with connecting
  cables for both the 100 and 200.  I don't know about the 102.  But there is
  one disk, and it contains the DOS for BOTH machines.  Two versions of
  everything are on the disk.

(Ron) Believe me when I say that the DVI DOS for the 100/102 IS DIFFERENT from
  the 200. They carry different part #'s from Tandy  and they will work on only
  one machine or the other, not both the cable for the 100 works only with the
  100 and the cable for the 102 will work with the 200.

(Sysop Tony) Of course the DOS is different.  There are TWO DOS's on the disk!
  One for the 100/102 and one for the 200.  The DVI is a "Universal disk drive
  for the portables.  It does not come in two versions.  And there are not two
  disks in the package.  And you don't have to special order a different disk
  if you have a 200.  There is one disk, and it contains both DOS's.  If you
  have something different, then you have something that is non-standard.
  There's no point in arguing the point. You have what you have, and I have
  what i have.  Apparently it is different.  OK?

(Sysop Denny) I think a call to National Parts is in order.  It would clear
  this up 

(Ron) Correction...Software Assembly

(Sysop Tony) Correction, Tandy Marketing.

(Sysop Denny) We aren't talking about the assembler  But the DOS, Ron.

(Ron) They'll refer you to Software Assembly

(Sysop Tony) They won't refer ME to Software Assembly!!!

(Joshua) The land of thick fingered elves?

(Ron) They'd refer JOHN ROACH to SA!!!

(Sysop Denny) Anyway, I think we need to move on.

(Phil) Curious how many splitscreen users there are here today.

(gene) me

(Ron) me too!

(Eiji) X-TEL here

(Phil) [Booo!]

(Joshua) How can you tell?

(Phil) Joshua

(Sysop Denny) Phil was taking a poll.

(Phil) gotta run special software.  If you don't, no split screen.

(gene) Eiji,  When in Japan, do you listen to  Country & Eastern music?  he-he

(Eiji) No, I don't listen music much  But when I do, I listen to classic
  music.

(gene) ok. just wanted to hear from you! Happy Holidays done

(Ron) Eiji. Any comments on the new Mitsubishi 286 and 386 machines?

(Eiji) I haven't seen them yet, Ron I'm planning to visit some computer
  stores in January.

(Ron) I will wait with bated breath till then. Thanks.  Phil,any plans for an
  OS'2 look-alike for the 100? <grin>

(Phil) Yeah, right!  Convert the TDD to a 1.4 Mb disk

(Joshua) Sorry I misunderstood you earlier. I'm rqather wary of machine code
  

(Ron) 0001000100100010001000011111111

(Joshua) software (though it sounds good). Another case when online is not as
  good as  face to face interface.

(Sysop Denny) Are you talking about XMDPW5 and split screen?

(Joshua) Rgiht

(Sysop Denny) Well, I wouldn't be too concerned about it  the program is
  pretty solid

(Joshua) When you said "Curious" I thought you meant "Isn't it curious"
  instead of "I am cur."

(Sysop Denny) and it does make quite a difference when  on line here.  There
  is no way for us to tell what type of software a person is using while
  online

(Sysop Tony) (another myth dispelled)

(Sysop Denny) but I bet some of the comercial companies would sure like to
  know!

(Curtis G) Speaking of companies is PCSG still in business and if so are
  they or will they be making a 

(Ron) VERY MUCH SO!

(Curtis G) SuperROM for the 102

(Sysop Denny) Curtis

(Curtis G) Yes

(Sysop Denny) SuperRom already works with the  T102, no problems.  But don't
  expect too much from them in the future for the Tandy laptops

(Curtis G) What about the Chipmunk?

(Sysop Denny) They are now called PERSONAL Computer Support Group  and have
  switched their focus to PC's.  The Chipmunk has been discontinued and can
  now only be purchased from Holmes Microsystems.
  The only thing they are selling for the Tandys is
  SuperROM and the Lucid/Write Roms.

(Phil) There was  a recent article in PC Magazine (I believe) that
  complimented PCSG (Lucid 3D) and TS (Laplink) on their successful
  "trasitions" from M100 world to PC laptop world.  I doubt if it was an
  accidient! <Grin>

(Ron) PCSG just won an award for technical excellence from PC Magazine for
  their new spreadsheet "LUCID 3D".

(Phil) [Musta bought lota ads!]

(Sysop Denny) Hopefully, TS will stick with the Tandys for a little longer
  than PCSG has.  We do need new goodies to keep up interest.

(Ron) Also, PC Magazine in an article written by Steve Manes (Neatness: it
  really counts) said that the M100 is not neat anymore  Little does he
  know!!!

(Phil) Mine isn't too neat any more.  Getting pretty messed up!

(Ron) Put a "safe-skin" on it,Phil

(Sysop Denny) Well, I just did a complete cleanup job on one of mine and it
  looks great now. (grin)

(Ron) Safe-skin protects the M100 from Coke and AIDS!(grin).

(Sysop Denny) Ok, do we have a new topic?  If not I'll get out the slides.
  your choice

(Curtis G) I am having a problem from time to time with the function keys
  double bouncing.  Do you know of a simple fix for this problem?

(Ron) New keyboard time!

(Curtis G) From Who?

(Ron) Radio Shack Service.

(Sysop Denny) No simple fix, because it's a little tough to tell if it's the
  actual keyboard or a possible chip problem.  If you don't have problems with
  ALL of the keys it's probably just the switch.  But if it's all of the
  function keys, that might suggest something different.

(Curtis G) Thanks Denny

(Sysop Denny) You can order a new keyboard from National Parts

(Sysop Tony) (or keys)

(Sysop Denny) but it is still rather expensive for the whole keyboard.

(Curtis G) Any knowledge of the price or part no.?

(Sysop Tony) Curtis, That question has come up on the message board several
  times.  It seems you can buy the keyswitch itself for a couple of bucks, and
  if you're handy, remove the old one and solder in the new one in about 10
  minutes.  Since the part number will have to be looked up, and it's not
  convenient to do so now,  suggest you leave a message on the board, and one
  of us will look it up and send you the info.  There is a minimum charge of
  about $10 though. 

(Curtis G) That I can do

(Ron) I'm looking

(Sysop Tony) You might need to buy several.

(Sysop Denny) Thanks Tony.

(Curtis G) Thanks Tony

(Sysop Denny) Seems though, that the most common failure for function keys is
  that they stop working altogether, or they have to be hit several times.
  (like mine) 

(gene) [and mine]

(Curtis G) and mine

(Sysop Denny) I haven't really heard of a debouncing problem  where they are
  double hitting. That would be heaven!

(Dana Hyde) How is the new 1400LT doing/ ?

(Ron) 1400 LT is backordered!  the part # for the function key  is AS-7570.

(Curtis G) Thanks Ron

(Sysop Denny) Dana, we don't handle the 1400LT here.  You can find support for
  it and other PC type Tandy computers on the TANDYPRO Fourm.  Since it is an
  MS-DOS machine, they are covering it there.

(Dana Hyde) I'll be happy with my 100 for a long time, especially if I can
  eventually get some of those nice goodies from Traveling Software.

(Ron) M100's forever!

(Sysop Denny) Yes, additional equipment sure does make these machines

(Ron) NEAT!

(Sysop Denny) much more fun.

(gene) Poll  If you were going to start over, what would be the 1st  extra you
  would buy. Excluding Disk Dr.? ga

(Ron) SuperROM

(Curtis G) SuperROM

(Sysop Denny) 8 bank Ram

(Sysop Tony) External 1200 baud modem.

(Phil) for 100, 8 rom bank  (RAM!)

(gene) ok thanx , just wondering as I never added on. done

(Phil) As a follow up to Ron's  mentioin of the Seve Manes article in PC Mag.
  They put the M100 in the same class with Lotus 1-2-3, 10 MB HD's and
  AT-class speed a s once neat but not so neat now.  Still not SHABBY company!

(Ron) AT-class speed OK but 10 Mb HD's (yuko!)

(Phil) [Spoiled kid speaking!]

(Ron) Also  Lotus 1-2-3 is rather passe'

(Phil) [compared to what, Ron?]

(Ron) I just got "Enable" and it is NEATO!  Sort of like SuperROM for the PC
  but incredibly powerful

(Phil) Ron, you should upload a reveiw of it to the IBMSW forum.

(Ron) I've got a Tandy 3000HL and I don't like IBM.

(Phil) [Tandy PRO forum, then]

(JOHN A) Thinking about adding some memory to my 102
  anything i should look out for

(Sysop Denny) There are several ways to go.  Node makes a variety of ram
  addons but it really depends on how much you are willing to  spend. You can
  add up to 2 meg of ram right now and another product comming out (haven't
  seen it yet) can take you up to 10 meg.  But this gets REALLY expensive.
  What did you have in mind.

(JOHN A) Something that can be added internally

(Sysop Denny) Do you have an M100 or T102 or T200?

(JOHN A) without to much fuss or surgury about 8k is all i really need  m 102

(Sysop Denny) Ok  Expanding RAM is a common interest of many users, so we have
  prepared files on the subject that cover much more than we can here.
  Depending on your interest, see EXPAND.RAM (100-200) or EXPAND.102, or if
  you want a LOT of RAM space, see BIGRAM.INF. (all in DL13)  For the 600,
  see EXPAND.600 in DL11.

(Ron) Check out the stuff from PJohn, do you have a 24K 102?  Repeater

(JOHN A) 16K 102

(Sysop Denny) You should be able to upgrade

(Ron) John, do you have a 24K 102?

(Sysop Denny) to 32K for about $28.  How did you get only 16K?

(Ron) No such animal as a 16K 102!

(JOHN A) My fault 24k 102 i have a DV/Iconnected  which takes up about 8k for
  dos

(Sysop Denny) Ok, then for $14 from Tandy you can  add an additional 8K.  See
  the file EXPAND.102 in DL 13 for details and an alternate source that runs
  about $8.  

(JOHN A)  OK i'll check it out. Thank you

(Ron) What does sending ";;C" do on the SIG?

(Sysop Denny) Nothing. But doing a /SEN (job#) does.  That will send a message
  to someone if you know their job number  which can be found by doing a /CO
  command.

(Ron) Even in private talk?

(Sysop Denny) Yep, actually, anywhere that you can list the job numbers, you
  can send from that point. On the message board, you don't need the slash in
  front of the command.  But you do a UST to find job numbers.  (can be used
  here also in the form /UST)

(Ron) ok.  The witching hour approaches!

(Sysop Denny) Well, if there is no new business  I'll close down the normal CO
  for now. Anything, guys?

(Ron) Bye,all.

(Sysop Denny) Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.
   *** END OF CONFERENCE ***

(Curtis G) Seasons Greetings to All Bye now

(Sysop Denny) Hope everyone had a nice Christmas.
