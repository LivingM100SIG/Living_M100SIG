(Sysop .^Dave^.) Next week we hope to have the BIGGEEE conference on Lucid,
  but today is chat about what is on your minds.
  So speak up ifn' ya gawts a question.


(Tom Whitworth) Dave on replying on a thread.
 If I read or download the message rather...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) we lost all after "If I read or download the message rather"
  but I guess you want to know how to REply after you have logged offf and
  read/printed the message. If the message # is known you can use the command:
  RE nnnnn
  at the Function menu, or prompt, where "nnnnn" is the message number
  and your reply will be fully addressed with no more effort on your part.
  See MESSAG.HLP and SAVMON.HLP in DL 0 for details.
(Tom Whitworth) I thought that qould give me a read message.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) RE is "Reply"
  RR, RI, RT, RF, RM, and RN are all Read commands.
  Let me suggest you use the "I" command at the function menu to download an
  excellent six page command description.
  That is "I" alone, the "IN" gives 29 pages.


(Eric S.) Wondering about being able to interface the M-100 into a Vianet
 network?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) MMMMmmmmmmm, SERIOUSLY doubt that it is possible but maybe I
  don't know enough about ViaNet; the Model 100 is capable of commmunicating
  with just about anything, but Vianet is rather specialized. Let us see if
  transcript readers have response. And/or you can leave query on message board
  in Section 1.
(Eric S.) What about NEC's portable.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) What about it? Has less com capability than the 100 if that is
  what you mean.
(Eric S.) Exactly what I mean.  Got Vianet running on a bunch Of NEC's and have
 one M-100 that would be nice to get in there.  That's why I asked.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good grief !!! You have a LOT more experience in that than
  I then. If the NEC 8201 can Vianet then it should be NO problem to get the
  Model 100 in there. Basically the same Telcom software except the NEC doesn't
  have built in modem. 100 can use external if needed.
(Eric S.) Hope you didn't think I had NEC portables Networked.  Have NEC
 APCIII's networked. Thought there might be an OMNINET brd for the M-100 that
 I hadn't seen.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oof! Sorry, all we think of here is portables. Have NEC
  database here. Can't help you Eric. Try message board or wait to see if
  sumwun responds to transcript.


(Eric S.) Yea, need a cheep drive for the M-100. Any Suggestions???
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Very best is the Chipmunk now going for $399; next best is the
  Tandy portable disk drive at $199 but it has MUCH less capability.
(Eric S.) Heard the Tandy had a wierd way of finding files.  Almost like tape.
 Is that true??
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not quite that bad, but it doesn't have random access.
  we have a LOT of supporting files in DL5 for both drives; see TDD.CAT and
  CHIPMK.CAT files there for descriptions.


(Rob D) Two quick q's...
 1) Were you able to get something lined up on SUPER ROM for a Sunday Co
 and 2) The last couple time I've logged on, I've gotten a prompt which says
 Subtopics Selected [None]. Why is this?  Nothing works, not even read messages
 without going through the extra step of selecting subtopics.  Good Greif!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) "Super ROM Sunday" (c) Denny Thomas will be next Sunday with
  special guest Michael Stanford from PCSG.
  2) Use the OP command then SU then you may select the topics that you want to
  have access to just using the number.
  There should be [*] marking for each section you have access to.
  [ ] means no access. It is a toggle switch. If you are adventurous, from the
  Function prompt you may use the command
  OP;SU;1;2;3;4;5;6;8;P
  Which will give you access to those sections IF you don't already have access
  to them.
(Rob D) Many thanks!  That's just what I needed to know.


(JON) How about portable printers; which is best?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) See the file PRNTRS.INF in the DL 6 database for information
  on some. The only one that I have any experience with is the TTX printer.
  Satisfys my needs when there is nothing else available. Consider ANY portable
  printer a stop gap measure.
(Rich L) I have the TRP-100; it's very nice and can use any type paper.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That paper bit is indeed a definite advantage.
(Rich L) also they are on sale now.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Another good point there!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) If there are no other questions at the moment, I'd like to
  make some comments about the new sig software for the benefit of all and
  those that will read the transcipt.
  One of the MAIN problems folks have been having is receiving the prompt
  "MORE!" or "Press ENTER for more" or some such thing depending on mode of
  operation after anywhere from 3 to 24 lines of text has been sent by
  CompuServe. Noticeable in Data Library especially.
  Solution: GO DEFALT and select Option 6. Then change the ENABLE to DISABLE
  and you should have no more problems.
  Temporary solution: use SET PAG command at most prompts.


(Mike A.) How do I get the message board back to 40 width 'sted 80 ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Temporary command is the SET WID command.
  Permanent fix is to GO DEFALT and change Option 5 [I think] which has a menu
  of six things or so.


(Mike A.) Still firm on next Sunday ?  seems kinda sparse today
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Still firm on next Sunday. Should have notice in Online Today
  by Monday night. This is a CROWD compared to what it has been. Have so far
  notified four folks by special message that have particular interest and will
  continue to grab more.
(Mike A.) Right, I've sent msg. to Bill Templeton, so he'll gab it up on the
 westcoast and Micheal Stanford will be up and ready by 11am EDT !
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good oh! Already made mention today of the special Lucid
  conference next week earlier in the transcript before you gawt here. Now we
  have it again.


(Gerald L. Gollinger) When I loged on this morning an accumulation of email
 messages were wiped out. any one have a similiar experience?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Assuming that you mean messages that you had filed in your
  Personal File Area ...
(Gerald L. Gollinger) yes
(Sysop .^Dave^.) those files must be accessed once every 30 days or they are
  deleted. EVERY file in PER must be used once a month or ZAP!
(Gerald L. Gollinger) Tthank you.  I did not realized i was off so long
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Gerald, but keep in mind that coming on to CompuServe
  without using the files in PER will not preserve them. You must go to PER or
  PRO and access them if only by opening and closing them.


(Ross_R) First, Dave thanks for hint about getting full charge on my 600;
 everything seems to work perfectly uncluding the once funky clock that
 wouldn't keep track of elapsed time while I was online last week!
 Secondly; Is there an appropriate place on the SIG to list used equipment for
 sale? i.e. my Model 100
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Post a brief message on the board being sure to include the
  word 'SALE' in the subject line; folks use 0 or 6 for such stuff. One section
  only.
  As to the 600: Now keep in mind the possiblility of OVER CHARGING the l'il
  fella!. The Tandy Newsletter has a tip about that permitting a 13 hour charge
  without overcharge beyond that time; uses the "Wake" option.
(Ross_R) Can > than 13 hour charge do damage? or just pass the point of
 dimishing returns?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Methinks that "damage" can occur, but may be just flakey
  performance as compared with immolation.
(Ross_R) Gotcha.. thanx! 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just whipped out the Tandy 600 Manual inre charging.
  See page 19.


(DOUG M.) Say Dave, I was talking to Tony about hooking a 200 up to a
 Macintosh.  I've been trying without success. Any hints?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sorry Doug, but I've no experience with either the 200 or Mac;
  s'poz Tony steered you to CABLE.MAC and such in DL 1 database??
(DOUG M.) Yes he did and yes, I made the cable and followed the other DLs,
 but to no avail.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Guess you'll have to bug him again or, HORRORS!, pop over to
  MACUS for ideas.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Let me share another CO tip before taking Elisa's question;
  when typing of others breaks up what you are typing, use CTRL-V to see what
  you've typed without sending it. CTRL-U will erase what you have typed
  without sending it.


(Elisa Leonelli) which is better super rom or ultimate rom?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Depends upon your needs; Super is definitely the ROM of choice
  if'n a spreadsheet is needed. Ultimate has what many consider to be the
  superior printing program but others think that Super's Write is better .
  Let's see what Mike has to say.
(Mike A.) I'd agree with what you just said...Super's the number-cruncher and
  really has no competition.   The Super/Ultimate word processors are very
  close indeed and more a style/operating preference; both have "outliner" type
  programs that prompt you into thinking if you will and Write sends documents
  thru Telcom, BTW.   Cost is just about same, 200 bucks or thereabouts.
  Databases, too, although not my forte'. Thazzaboutit.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) For the record: Mike represents Portable Computer Support
  Group. VITAL point Elisa: Both companies sell on 30 day money back guarantee.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, any chance of you showing up at the Maryland 100 Picnic
  if we ever get it off the ground, located, and dated? Shooting for south of
  Baltimore. Need organizers.
(Mike A.) Hey, you name the place and I'll BE THERE, techno gadgets in tow.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Good O!
(Mike A.) Maybe after the Heat/Haze/Humidity though?


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hi Maddi!
  Speak the speech I pray you as you pronounced it to you.
(Maddi) [BAWLMERese??]
 Last night my monitor died for a while, as I was reading Help files in another
 SIG's CO. I don't know wha hoppened. Comment?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) very clearly that should be a lesson to you NOT to use another
  SIG !!!  [tee hee]
  Howsomeverwhichway, I've no monitor experience such as you have ...
(Maddi) Gotta! I'm their guest today! Work at home SIG at 7:00pm. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) and have no bright ideas at all, at all, at all.
  Does anybody else have a monitor to help Maddi?
(DavidB) What kind of monitors are you looking for?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Frankly, methinks probably your DVI DOS was the problem Maddi.
  David, not looking for one. Maddi's barfed on her.
(Maddi) I hope not; gonna do more testing; may go to another disk that I have
 "just in case".
(DavidB) Sound's like Maddi's monitor is disgusting; what happened?
(Maddi) David- I was in another SIG's CO, reading a help file, when my Taxon
 monitor flickered & went blank. I was able to get out of it all log off,
 & after a bit all seemed to work well again, including that CO area of the
 other SIG.
(DavidB) Maddi, sounds like a real dependability problem. Do you have it
 working now? What are you now using?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Could it have been temporary low power Maddi?
(Maddi) Never happened before in over 2 years! I am using my DVI, but not
 (except for being in monitor mode) of course when this happened.
 So far no trouble today yet.
 ^Dave^, that is exactly what I suspect- the A/C in the next room may have
 cycled on, & caused the low power because the monitor may be connected to its
 circuit - no other components of my system are.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, bestesterer of luck on your CO!


(DavidB) What does "Send Q or C..."  mean?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just what it means David ...
  Send a Q if you have a question ...
  send a C if you have a comment on current topic
  in order to get into the lineup.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, we try to help folks as best we can on these Sunday
  morning chats. Next week will be a SPECIAL conference on the Lucid program in
  Super ROM.


(gmd) are these morning chats regular??
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, every Sunday morning from 11:00 to 13:00 Eastern time.
  We also have ...
(gmd) What types of things are discussed
(Sysop .^Dave^.) a less formal yak-yak Wednesday evenings from 10 to midnight
  Eastern. gmd, we generally discuss whatever folks have on their minds.
  However, on occasion we have a guest for a special topic.
(gmd) sounds good will see you next week
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Come earlier next week gmd!!


(Jeff Streutker) What is POWR DISK... I've read about it in the DL section.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) it is a program to replace FLOPPY.CO for use of the Tandy
  portable disk drive. See POWR-D.PRD and POWR-D.REV in the DL6 database.
(Jeff Streutker) Those are the actual programs then?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No. "PRD" means product description and "REV" stands for
  review. The program is a commercial product and not available here.
  If you have the TDD, see the DSKMGR.* files in DL 5 and be sure to inspect
  TDD.CAT which has descriptions of the TDD files in DL5.
  DL 6 is for commercial product information.
(Jeff Streutker) Thanks... would you know about it's availability in Canada?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mail order only, everywhere to the best of my knowledge.
(Jeff Streutker) That's great!  tnx very much!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) grabbeee fileees in DL 6 Jeff!


(Craig Merwitzer) where in the USA is U at?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Craig ....
  You are from Miami area ...
  Wayne is from Fort Worth area ...
  and I'm from Baltimore area ...
(Craig Merwitzer) yepper, how can ya tell?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is determined by the "Nod" part of the list you get with
  the /ust 30 command here and UST at the Function: prompt.
(Craig Merwitzer) I see U R node 30
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, 30 is the channel we are in.
(Craig Merwitzer) gotcha
 Just testing to make sure you were paying attention
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Try /UST 30 against left margin.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) He gawn!
Conference ended!
