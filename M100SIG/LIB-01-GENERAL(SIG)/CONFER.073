(larry l) just wondering what sorts of changes you have to make to a program
 to make it 200 compatible.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) it depends upon whether or not it is "straight" Basic with no
  CALL, PEEK, POKE statements involved or not. If there are machine code
  addresses needed, then you need to convert with help of the various files in
  DL 4 that have the comparisons. If NO such calls, then a Model 100 program
  will run fine except it'll use only the top half of the screeen. That may be
  changed with some changes to the PRINT and PRINT@ statements.
  Tony? Which POKE or RAMCALL files? Which files help for converting 100
  addresses for 200 use?
(Sysop tony) well CALLS.ROM will help with comparative CALL addresses listing
 both the 100 and 200 versions of many useful ones but not all of them.
 Also, ROM.200 will help most; POKES.100 and POKES.200 can be compared for many
 of the poke addresses and that's about all.... except that I try to keep on
 top of them and respond on the message board to such changes.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Any specifics larry??
(larry l) nope...just wondering how compatible the two machine are.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just fine UP TO the point of a ML address call in any way at
  all. CALL and POKE are the two that COULD be dangerous.


(Ross_R) Question regards my new 600. Is there a way to use imbedded printer
 control codes with the WORD application on the 600 ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, not unless you have a printer that will only take 7 bits
  There is some hanky-panky that allows using codes >128 to fool the 600 and
  printer into doing what you want. We have a file in the DL 0 on that.
(Ross_R) Y did dey do dat?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ross, try the BRO/KEY 600 commmand in DL 0. Have you found all
  the main 600 programs here or don't you have Basic as yet?
(Ross_R) Nope haven't found main 600 prgs yet, but yes do have basic ROM as of
 yesterday
(Sysop .^Dave^.) DL 2 has best applications programs and DL 1 has important TIP
  files for Telcom use; the DL 4 has utilities that include adding the
  capability to PEEK, POKE, VARPTR and other stuff by replacing DBASES.LIB with
  UTILITY.LIB, so if'n you want get into the insides of the 600., there it is!!
(Ross_R) Egg salad! thanks as always
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ross, every 600 file DOES have 600 among the keywords, so you
  may reliably use S/KEY 600 or BRO/KEY 600 in the databases 0 to 4 plus 6.


(Denny T) I've been having a problem finding a file that explains the procedure
 used in TELUTL.100. do you know the name of the associated help file?
 it has to do with disabling the screen scroll
(Sysop tony) The TELUTL file came to us from Bill Templeton's group and there
 is no supporting documentation. however, I expanded the information somewhat
 in the file TELTIP.001 in DL1 adding many more functions to the concept and
 delving a little into how it works; may be helpful for you.
(Denny T) I must not have read into the file far enough before giving up.
 I'll check it out again
(Sysop tony) Also see CALLS.ROM as many of those functions can be used, too.


(Rob D) Are there any Lucid Data users among us today?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I'm the most un-lucid person I know!
(CURT) AN OWNER not a user
(Sysop tony) I've never been accused of being lucid.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rob, you wanna ask about WUMPUS.100 instead? 
(Rob D) Sorry! I've been waiting for some users of SUPER  ROM Lucid Data to
 discuss the complexities of the program.  Prensky, myself, and a few others
 have been having a lot of problems with the application side of that piece
 of the software and perhaps its just too soon for many users.
(Denny T) Bill Templeton is very involved with DATA  he might be able to help.
 also Phil Wheeler is just starting on it.
(Rob D) Templeton is one of the "others" experiencing problems.
(Denny T) oops!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rob, let me see if we can get a Lucid conference next Sunday
  or the Sunday following with Mike Anders and a teko from PCSG here to talk to
  all of you at once. Is that a good idea Rob?
(Denny T) [Super ROM Sunday]
(Rob D) Not only a good idea, a GREAT one!
(CURT) super idea
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, watch the message board and Short bulletin for
  developments. I'll shoot for the 27th but we'll see.
(Rob D) Thanks .^Dave^. I gotta go!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) EVERYBODY keep in mind that if'n it seems practical to have a
  CO on a particular topic we can try to get it going.
  We need FEEDBACK much, much more than we receive.
  On everything!


(ROSS RAYMOND) [back lurking]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Lurkers learn lots listening ....
  but MORE by asking!!
(Ross_R) [yeah like remembering to shorten their handle!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh, did you find anything in DL land?? 
(Ross_R) Didn't get there Dave, was disconnected by my own clumsiness on the
 power button! 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) On the 600? Don't like the key lay out!
(Ross_R) regards status line (last one) in Telcom. Looks like there is a clock
 that should show elapsed time for on-line sessions but mine is stuck on
 00:04:00. Any thoughts?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, how about regular clock? Suggest you may need a heavier
  power up. Have you given it a FULL overnight charge since you got it?
(Ross_R) Regular clock is OK -- 8 hours last night
(Sysop .^Dave^.) and you DO know that the 600 does NOT charge whilst in use?
(Ross_R) Huh uh!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, maybe you better pop back to Shack, especially if its
  still within the 30 days.
(Ross_R) I'll try your suggestion tonight.. if I can leave it alone that long
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, if you haven't given it at least 12 hours charge without
  using it, do so.
(CURT) Ross, do you have the Basic Rom?
(Ross_R) Yes
(CURT) is it similar to 1oo basic?
(Ross_R) Yeah .. minus some and plus others. But particularly minus things like
 INSTR, Peek Poke etc.
(CURT) i find it would be less useful without 2 rom slots like the 100
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I didn't find any further help on the time connected stuff,
  but wondered if you were aware that Basic or Plan can be copied from ROM to
  disk or RAM so that you don't have to keep popping ROM chip in or out.
  Since I have 224K RAM installed my BASIC is normally in RAM.
(Ross_R) Yes ! I did find that little gem and called Purple Computing
 post haste. Am now experimenting with the DBCALLS whieo using BASIC from RAM.
 But didn't know you could choose bwetween BASIC or PLAN to have loaded from
 ROM to disk to RAM. Very nice!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ross, I never use Plan except to test such as the *.PLN files
  that I've uploaded here from MSOFT but I keep PLAN chip installed and Basic
  in RAM so that I have access to both. Both are on System menu.
  Note that DBASES.600 in DL 2 contains the most thorough and advanced use of
  DBCALLS.LIB that I'm aware of. CHECK.600 to a lesser degree.
(Ross_R) OK.. am going to browse those after this session. can't wait.
 Can see my MC bill next month will be outrageous. But the excitemnet is wel
 worth i ! 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Ross, be SURE to get DBASES.DOC and note that it is
  CHECKS.600 not CHECK.600; both of those programs have supporting .FIL and
 .DAT files to be downloaded too, so be sure to BRO for the file descriptions.
  Have a BALL, but be sure to power up!!
(Ross_R) [gotta go.. thanks all]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Lotza luck ...
  600ing the 100 way Ross!


(Dana) I finally saw a 102 this week also
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ah So! How do you like it? Found any incompatibilities other
  than the 40 pin buss as yet??
(Dana) Not that I could see. I'm really amazed at the slim-down job they did,
 though.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Dana, methinks one of the things that I'd have trouble getting
  used to is the relocated F keys and cursor key position switches.
(Dana) I was about to say that 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Probably no problem for the person that never used a 100
  before but methinks t'would drive me NUTS!!


(Denny T) I just got the screen scrolling function working while online.
 just wrote a little program that interfaces with X-Tel. works perfectly!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, but don't blame Sigea if your Model 100 melts!!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Still using Mickey for the Bubble machine
  and Minnie with the Chipmunk?? 
(Jon O) you're right on both counts, and I've got another M100(299.00) using
 the DVORAK system.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, I saw your messages to the author about that, didn't know
  you were using a third 100 for it though.
  Has SoundSight done any enhancements to your Bubble since I saw it a bit over
  a year ago??
(Jon O) Soundsight has come up with it's operating system on a ROM chip.
 Also they have some software (spreadsheet and database) that will be ready
 soon. don't have either. Also they have a new design for the bubble which I'll
 be getting soon; made of plastic rather than the metal case I have now.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Can you tell us more about the "new design" other than change
  to plastic which must mean, in part, lighter weight. Any other hardware
  changes for connection to 100 et cetera?
(Jon O) The case will allow you to have access to the battery case like the
 M100 rather than having to open it up. hopefully it might be lighter also.
 They are also comming up with an interface for the Chipmunk.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) My, my, they must be doing better than one would have noticed
  based on folks that visit the SIG. You are the only Bubble man I know!!


(LARRY R.) WOULD 1200 BAUD BE FASTER?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) 1200 baud is a terrible waste of money for use in CO because
  the typing speed is the determining factor for speed of the yakking.
  1200 baud saves a lot of money for up/downloading of programs and files.
  That make sense?
(LARRY R.) i would agree
(Sysop .^Dave^.) One other thing about 1200 baud for the Model 100 and
  Tandy 200 family though. It is necessary to use a program that doesn't
  display download to screen or you won't be able to have an effective rate
  more than about 500 or so.


(Allan Green) A COUPLE OF ?'S ABOUT TRP-100
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I know zilch about the TRP, but ask anyway. Maybe we can help.
(Allan Green) Codes to turn off "top of form"; ie: with MULTIPLAN I don't want
 to go to top of form when only using a section.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, can't help you there but maybe someone reading the
  transcript can help. Also, you might want to leave a message in Section 5 on
  the message board. P'raps sumbaudee will chip in with the help.
  I've just not played with the TRP at all, at all, at all.


(Allan Green) I am very interested in the portable disk .  Is it worth the $$?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Which one Allan?? The Tandy or the Chipmunk are both worth the
  money. The Chipmunk costs more but delivers a lot more too. The Tandy is far,
  far better than a cassette recorder.
  See DRIVE.* files in DL 6.
  We have a lot of support for both drives here on the SIG.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well time to call the conference to a close ...
  bye bye all.
