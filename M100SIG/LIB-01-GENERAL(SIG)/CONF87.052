(Larry L) morning  Hi there

(Sysop Denny) Hi Larry

(Larry L) hello  hiya Denny..you head honcho today?

(Sysop Denny) Well, I'm hosting, if that's what you mean.

(Larry L) yup...I've been away for the last 2 weeks..anything new?..

(R Caley) Good morning all

(Larry L) hi rush

(Sysop Denny) Geez, big question!

(Dave M., UltraSoft) G'mornin'

(Larry L) denny...no pressure

(Sysop Denny) Seems we have a new Rep from U-soft, grin.

(Phil W) [hi, all]

(Dave M., UltraSoft) richard's getting boggeled down with paperwork!  How
  about Tony's slides that I keep hearing about?

(Phil W) [awfully early for the slides!]

(Sysop Denny) We'll get to those later.

(R Caley) OK  This may be a silly question..but  I own 3 or 4 very good word
  processors for M-100 - What would be a good reason to elect to purchase
  Ultrasoft's Text power as well?  are there any Special features I might
  covet?

(Dave M.) Well, Text Power is not a Word Processor.  It inhances the already
  existing TEXT. It gives you a graphic drawing of your letter on your LCD.
  You can Embed special Print Codes for your printer (ex. Bold, superscript,
  etc.)

(R Caley) OK..thanks...that's it..

(Phil W) Dave,

(Dave M.) yes?

(Phil W) there is at least one very good program, PRN100, in DL2  that has
  similar features.  What are the special and unique aspects of Text Power
  100?

(Dave M.) Well, I'll have to look at PRN100 to be able to answer that, Is it
  ML or basic?

(Phil W) Machine language loader form.

(Dave M.) Like I said I'll Have to look at PRN100.  ga.. sorry!

(Sysop Denny) Well, any more on that RC?

(R Caley) Nope..

(Sysop Denny) Ok, looks like we might be getting the slides out early
  after all! 

(Dave M.) Yes, I was looking thru the Data libraries a while back  And found a
  file that tells you how to put a double drive in the DVI. I'm thinking of
  doing this for mine, but I'd like to use the system bus to control which
  side is accessed. Any one know how to send a 6-volt signal thru one of the
  unused ports?

(R Caley) I have a two drive DV/I  and it works great..I'm not exactly sure
  what Dave means by "which side"...they are single sided drives..

(Sysop Denny) Well, you can put a double sided drive ...

(Dave M.) well, this file tells you how to put a double sided drive in the
  bottom slot ...

(Phil W) [double drive, or double-sided drive, Dave?]

(Dave M.) 1/2 meg total memory!  double-sided Drive ...

(Sysop Denny) Dave, I think you access ...

(Dave M.) replace second drive with a double sided drive! ...

(Sysop Denny) the other drives by using 1:  as a prefix ...

(Dave M.) or in my case , add a drive.

(Sysop Denny) I'm not sure that 2: or 3: is valid  Did the file describe that?

(R Caley) [this is confusing]

(Dave M.) yes, the second drive can be controled by the motor relay (all you
  need is a small switch).  sorry (cassette MOTOR)

(R Caley) Ok  There is NO way you can access a 2: or 3: unless  you have
  written some type of alternate DOS to overlay the DV/I's Rom..

(Sysop Denny) Well, it seems you have 0: and 1: time two ...

(Dave M.) well the way this works. you still use 1: but, ...

(Sysop Denny) On a switch, you move to the backside of each drive.

(Dave M.) you flick a switch to access the other side of the second drive. I
  wanted to make this controled by software! phew confusing subject!

(R Caley) [where's the file?]

(Sysop Denny) Ok, not sure about that one, Dave ...

(Dave M.) DV/I data library. ...

(Sysop Denny) But our resident DVI guru ...

(Dave M.) can't remeber the name.

(R Caley) I'll get a hardware man on it

(Sysop Denny) Leonard Erickson  should have something to say about that.
  PPN=70465,203 If you'd like to leave a message.

(Dave M.) I'll drop him a line, thanx.

(Sysop Denny) Ah, we have the name of the file:  DVI2ND.INF. (DL9)

(Dave M.) That's IT!

(Larry L) ok  I was wondering if Tandy sells overseas....I just got back from
  Israel and they seem to be living on IBM clones and Apple clones  also Lots
  of Commodores.

(Dave M.) Well, I'm not sure if Tandy  Sells in Israel, but i do know that the
  sell in England.

(Sysop Denny) Yes...and they are pulling out of Germany, as it has been
  reported here.

(Larry L) I see....It seems a good place to sell a reliable less expensive
  computer.  Also  I was amazed by the amount of software piracy overseas.
  The motto "It's mine  and I'll do with it what I want" is  the norm.

(Sysop Denny) Well, I guess it cuts down expenses!

(Larry L) yes  Also the quality of software is markedly lower.

(DaveW.) Speaking of inexpensive,  I've run across a $79 128K print  buffer,
  anyone interested?

(Larry L) [Tell us Dave]

(Sysop Denny) That's a pretty good deal ga Dave.

(DaveW.) It's a no frills buffer made by  Practical Peripherals in  Westlake
  Village, Ca. I purchased one through PC Connection in  New Hampshire.

(Sysop Denny) Thanks Dave,  I bought one of their full featured ones  for
  work. It was quite a bit more expensive. The thing to remember with simple
  print buffers is that they usually don't allow you to reprint what is in the
  buffer, so it is just a simple print spooler.

(DaveW.) That's correct. All you can do  is reset the buffer by turning  the
  unit off and back on. I got it strickly to speed up  throughput to printer.

(Sysop Denny) That is a good deal though...can you upgrade to 256K?

(DaveW.) No, it is fully configured  at 128K.

(Sysop Denny) ok, any more on that?

(DaveW.) [Uses 4 41256 DRAMs.]

(Bill H.) ok  looks like slide time and  I just got back from a Motorcycle
  vacation to Northern Calif and Nevada and I took my 102 with me for
  checking the weather etc. also stopped by Node Computers in Nevada City calif
  but I must have got there on a fishing day  ha ha  or lunch time --
  very hot so I didn't stick around for  them to come back.

(Sysop Denny) Too bad. It would have been good to have a report on them...

(Dave M.) That's agood Idea. I'll be doing a Montreal, que. --->  Vancouver,
  B.C. trip this summer, by motrocycle I never thought of bringing my 100 to
  check on weather.

(Bill H.) works fantastic

(Dave M.) Using CIS, I presume

(Bill H.) yes

(Sysop Denny) If you make it to Vancouver, you could check in on Traveling
  Software, grin

(Bill H.) using the PP and EF along  with the Lf  lets  you know whats going
  on all around you and you tailor your trip  to the fine weaather.
  be sure and get the phone no.s from  csis before the trip. (GO PHONES)  I
  used an old list and sometimes was in a location that I knew  had a new node
  but couldn't find it.

(Sysop Denny) Bill, did you do any weather maps?

(Bill H.) negitive but you might be interested to know that the 102 was in
  the trunk of my Goldwing when I went thru Sacramento at 100+ degrees and no
  problems.

(Sysop Denny) Hearty little beastie ain't it.

(Dave M.) Bill. I'll trade you my SilverWing for youR GoldWing (grin)

(Bill H.) ha ha ha ha!!!

(DaveW.) [I'll keep my VMAX.]

(joshua) The user group lists in the libraries are pretty old.  Does
  anyone know of new ones in the Balt. Md area?

(Sysop Denny) Haven't heard of any, but you might try Dave Thomas [70526,1117]

(joshua) or new ones at all! considering that one of the lists is sponsored
  BY Portable 100 magazine.

(Sysop Denny) Well there is now a national user group being sponsored  by
  Laptop User magazine. If you are not a subscriber yet see MAG.100 in DL13 on
  info how to get a FREE subscription to the mag and info on how to join the
  user group.

(joshua) Enough national, I'd like a little regional stuff

(Sysop Denny) Well, like I said, Dave Thomas might be able to help you, he
  lives in that area.

(Sysop Denny) Do you have a question Gerald?

(Gerald G) Yes, but on another topic.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, If Joshua is thru  We may proceed. ga Gerald ga.

(joshua) yes

(Gerald G) There are over a half dozen companies manufacturing laptop ms dos
  equipment did Tandy make any forecasts on whether it would be  entering
  that market?

(Sysop Denny) There have been rumblings, but nothing "offical"  They have a
  pretty firm policy of not pre-announcing *anything* (Except the accoustic
  cups!)

(Bill H.) what would be  the advantage to ms dos and how would it enhance the
  laptop ?

(Sysop Denny) Bill, this would be a completely new machine.

(Gerald G) I would assume that data entered into a ms dos lapotop could be
  transferred to a desktop at home and the office.  Also, ms dos programs that
  were run on desktops might work on ms dos laptops and permit more people
  to transact business away from the home/office.

(Sysop Denny) Yes, and they would be in direct competition with Toshiba and NEC

(joshua) I would think they got a little burned on the 600 (brand new machine
  with expanded capability) and are going with low cost versions of IBM's
  products after all they don't have to create their rep. along with their
  machines.

(Gerald G) I believe that new users of ms dos laps tops are in at least five
  digit and perhaps 6 digits figures  There is definitely a market for this
  equipment and since it was mentioned here that the 102 has few enchancements
  over the m100 (except making the new version inompatible with existing third
  party accessories such as disk drives, etc) I am not in a capacity to speak
  for Tandy, but the public appears to be more and more interested in the new
  laptop models, and another entry into the market might spread everyone a
  little thin, there is business to be had.

(Sysop Denny) Well, if Tandy gets into it, they usually have done their
  marketing homework.

(J.D. (D.C.)) Hello?

(Sysop Denny) Hi JD

(J.D. (D.C.)) Hi Denny

(joshua) hi jd

(J.D. (D.C.)) Hi Joshua...u near Baltimore?

(Sysop Denny) Do you have a question, JD?

(Phil W) [slide time!]

(J.D. (D.C.)) Anyone know of a Tandy 200 for sale? ) Denny=> Been looking for
  a good deal on a 200

(Sysop Denny) JD, You can check out any ...

(J.D. (D.C.)) Denny=> I just purchased a NEC 8401....any comments about it?

(Sysop Denny) sale items by doing a RS;S;SALE;0 command. (on the message board)

(J.D. (D.C.)) Denny=> Thanks...I do every day!

(Sysop Denny) Ok, Phil

(Phil W) New topic -- checksums
  If any one here (or reading the transcript) is a user of QIKCHK, LDQQCK,
  CHECK.ASM, CHECK.PC or CHEC.COM please note that these pgms gave
  incorrect result for extended (8-bit) ASCII files.  They have now been
  fixed, and new versions are in DL7.

(J.D. (D.C.)) Anyone know anything about the NEC 8401 laptop?

(Sysop Denny) Yes, important announcement, especially  since we have our first
  8 bit file in the library, which has caused all of this in the first place.
  JD, I don't think anyone here is familiar with that NEC. Ok, another
  anouncement:  There is now a new version of EM8SIG.MMM in DL3 that handles
  the new changes to Easyplex so, if you are a user of this program, it would
  be wise to pick up a new copy.

(J.D. (D.C.)) Thanks Denny...see you all later....if I ever get a Tandy!

(Sysop Denny) Is it slide time?

  whew, saved again  ga Joshua

(joshua) Slide time? What, free for all?

(Sysop Denny) No, I hold up slides, and then describe them to you!

(joshua) No my real question is: Any third party soft/hardware to go with
  the ...

(Sysop Denny) (they are Tony's slides actually. grin)

(joshua) new Tandy PDD? and how useful are the old 3rd party DOS's?

(Sysop Denny) Well, Have you heard of Sardine?

(joshua) Now I have! I think I may have seen the ad in Laptop User.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, yes there is an ad there.  It is the newest ROM available
  and uses the TDD for a 30,000 word dictionary It also will boot (with a
  single key) any operating system that you name DOS100.CO  The newest OS for
  the TDD1 is Power-DOS by Acroatix and For the TDD2,  There will be a new
  version of Disk-Power by Ultrasoft.  Most of the commercial OS's are very
  useful, your only decision is which one suits your needs best.

(joshua) Thanks , thats about what i wondered  but the os's for TDD1 are not
  going to be automatically working on a TDD2. Right?

(Sysop Denny) Right, the current version of Disk-Power works with  the TDD2,
  but they are coming out with a new one that takes full advantage of the new
  system.  Other vendors will be coming out with new versions (hopefully) But
  Sardine works with both right now.

(Bill H.) [theres a good write up on  Sardine in one of the DL's]

(Sysop Denny) [hee, hee, Thanks, I wrote it!]

(Bill H.) congrats !!

(joshua)  is Sardine an OS itself or a loader?

(Sysop Denny) Well, it has a loader program for a normal OS  but it is also
  its own operating system ...

(Phil W) [one of Denny's major accomplishments this year! (tee-hee)]

(Sysop Denny) when it is using the dictionary disk  [Hey, lay off!]

(joshua) ok thanks.

(Bill H.) not you josh... the other guys he meant!

(Sysop Denny) Oh, yes! that was for Phil!

(Bill H.) ok

(joshua) oh quite understood!

(Bill H.) does anyone know where to get one of  those Franklin spelling
  checkers ?

(Sysop Denny) Franklin?

(Bill H.) yes  its a little hand held  job like a calculator that checks
  about 80,000 words

(Sysop Denny) Hmm  Nope, haven't heard of that one  but it sounds neat.

(Bill H.) I will find one and let you know ,  its about $90.00 but I would
  like to have one sitting next to my computer.

(Sysop Denny) Yes, I have a 30lb unabridged dictionary sitting here that
  gives me a hernia everytime I have to use it.

(Bill H.) This thing is pocket size but I don't know where to find it now.
  also, it uses wildcards.

(Sysop Denny) Sounds like it might be from the Franklin Mint company

(Bill H.) yeah...  the cost is for sure.

(Sysop Denny) You might try finding an ad from them (they're everywhere) to
  check it out.

(Bill H.) two minutes to go Denny and you're off the hook !  where's
  [everywhere]?

(Sysop Denny) In almost every mag I look at there is an ad of some kind for
  the Franklin mint. They sell all sorts of stuff.

(Bill H.) ahh so  I'll check   thanks.  just you and me Denny. they all left.

(Sysop Denny) Well, the clock in the computer says it's time so it looks like
  we're out of time for this morning's conference.  So I'll end the formal
  conference now.  Feel free to stick around and chat further, if you like.
  Thanks for coming this morning, we appreciate your input.   Bye.

    *** END OF CONFERENCE ***

(Bill H.) See you later Denny.

(Sysop Denny) Thanks for hanging in, Bill. bye.

(Bill H.) bye
