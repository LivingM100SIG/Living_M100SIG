(Tom Glovier) HI BOB

(Bob Harrison) Hi all!!

(Denny) Hi Tony

(Denny) Continuing with the messages on the board, about discontinuing the
  Chipmunk,  I talked to Glenn again and he discussed the T102 bus problem
  again.  The tech types that he was talking to were very interested in making
  the change, but when it got to the marketing dept. they said "Why should
  we do that? We don't use the bus!" (Sigh)

(Sysop Tony) Well  I think that's another demo of the prevailing attitude at
  the Tandy Tower, despite claims to the contrary.  It seems that some of the
  folks down there have lost touch with the folks that buy the products.
  Perhaps that's why they call it the "Ivory Tower"!  (grin)  Anyway, what
  interested me in that message exchange was the fact that PCSG has apparently
  decided to give up on the Chipmunk.  It was certainly obvious that they
  couldn't compete with 7000 Tandy stores all selling the TDD at a lower
  price, but they did have the Rolls-Royce of the disk drives.  Just didn't
  seem to know how to market it.  Their current ad campaign, comparing the
  Chipmunk to the TDD was a bit of uninspired thinking, in my opinion.  You
  should never compare your product to the competition that way.  But then, it
  seems as if PCSG never had a handle on the Chipmunk from the beginning, and
  constantly dropped the ball... or threw it away!  I can't imagine that they
  simply refused to give Holmes Engineering a copy of the source code for the
  DOS.   That just boggles the mind.

(Denny) Yes, it does.  I think the lack of co-operation with this bus problem
  was the deciding factor on the pullout. They wouldn't be able to get
  people to send their computers in to be modified very easily and there would
  be heavy market resistance to doing so.   Maybe when they finally drop it,
  they'll let loose of the source.

(Sysop Tony) Well of course Tandy states "officially" that they have been
  making every effort to cooperate with third-party suppliers to solve the buss
  problem.  But I can't think of anything they could have done  that would be
  more disruptive to that market than to change the buss.  And I get the
  feeling that somewhere,  someone HAD to know it would cause problems.  The
  apparent attempt to release a second version of the 102, with a different
  buss went from bad to worse.  Now you've got two non-compatible versions
  floating around out there.  (Shaking of head...)  Just looks like  a lot of
  poor planning.  But I'll be sorry to see the Chipmunk go.   There is no
  question it was a better drive for the 100.  Too bad it never worked right
  with the 200, and no viable reports from the 102 users.

({_Rush C.) Is PCSG dropping Chipmunk..and Holmes as well?

(Denny) Yes, PCSG is dropping it, as reported to me by the operator there,
  but Holmes is still interested in selling it  but they will have a {)ig
  problem if they can't get the DOS from PCSG to market it themselves.  BTW,
  The bus problem really only affects devices that use interrupts...
  the Chipmunk is about the only thing that will be affected. Ram devices will
  continue to work fine.

(Rush C.) Sounds like Holmes did a poor job  of setting up their "pre-marital"
  agreement with PCSG.

(Sysop Tony) At the time, Larry Holmes was scrambling, trying to bring the
  Chipmunk to market. The early version of the DOS just didn't work well
  enough.  He exchanged marketing rights for developing a new DOS. What bothers
  me about it is that there are virtually no reports of 102 users with
  Chipmunks although PCSG says it works.  They also say the 200 version works,
  and we have reports from users that it doesn't work very well.  Any more on
  this topic, Rush? Denny?

(Denny) no

(Rush C.) no

(Sysop Tony) OK.... Ron is up next.  ga Ron

(RON RIVERS) NEW USER WHAT IS BUSS PROBLEM

(Sysop Tony) Are you finished with your question, Ron?

(RON RIVERS) YEA

(Sysop Tony) Please type the letters "ga" when you are finished, so we know
  you are done.  Otherwise, we wait for you to continue.  The buss problem is
  a bit more than we can discuss here, but basically, when they discontinued
  the 100,  and brought out the 102, someone decided it would be a good idea
  to buffer the buss, and they did so.  Unfortunately, that meant that every
  buss-connected device would no }ilonger work.  So you couldn't take your Model
  100 peripherals, and attach them to the 102. You have a com{_ment Gerald?  ga Gerald

(Gerald G) Sort of, I will remain on this topic...
  The TDD would work with the 100 and 102, wouldn't it?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  The TDD is connected to the RS-232 port,  and has nothing
  to do with the system buss. 

(Bob H.)  what's someone who bought a 102 two days ago to do?

(Sysop Tony) Bob, I don't see how that will affect your decision at all.
  There's nothing wrong with the 102.  It works fine.  It's a good piece of
  gear.  You just will have to be selective in your choice of peripherals, and 
  always make sure that anything you buy to plug into it  will work with it,
  before purchase.

(Gerald G) Gee, I am still a novice at this  Will Tandy printers work with the
  new 102?

(Sysop Tony) OK  first off, the 102 is not "new".  It's been out since the
  first of the year.  Certainly Tandy printers will work with it.  The Tandy
  printer line is designed to work with the Tandy computers. .... Not with
  much of anything else,  but certainly with the Tandy computers.  That's part
  of their design philosophy.  Just like IBM, they want you to buy not only
  the computer from them,  but all the peripherals and software too.  So they
  build in these little quirks, so that their stuff is compatible, but you may
  have to bend over backwards to get anything else to work right.

(Gerald G) let me continue

(Sysop Tony) Does that answer the question, Gerald?

(Gerald G) No.  I assume that the ms dos tandy line such as the sx1000 will
  continue ...

(Phil) [That was a Yes, Gerald!]

(Gerald G) to work with the existing printers?

(Sysop Tony) I don't see any reason to dispute your assumption. ...

(Gerald G) You are right Phil, that is another sig?

(Sysop Tony) Tandy would certainly be stupid to do something to the MS-DOS
  machines that would prevent them from working with current model printers.
   Am I missing something here that you are trying to get to?

(Gerald G) 'I am looking for a yes no answer now.  Did Tandy recently come
  out with a ms dos laptop?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.

(Denny) [1400LT]

(Sysop Tony) Any more on that, Gerald?

(Gerald G) If there are no other questions on the 102 I have some on the 1400Lt.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... first off, the 1400LT is not going to be supported on this
  forum.  So unless someone happened to have an interest, you'll get little
  official support here.  It will be supported on the TRS80PRO forum however.

(Phil) Gerald,  has an interesting question, if I understand it.  The Tandy
  MS-DOS machines are billed as being IBM compatible which would imply a
  compatible printer interface but we know that with the M100 et al we need to
  add a linefeed to get to a compatible situation.  It may be that with the
  1000, 1400LT, et al the same is true or that they truly are IBM compatible
  in this interface.  Good question -- but I would ask it in TANDY PRO Forum
  where the Tandy DOS machines are all supported.

(Sysop Tony) OK - I always thought "IBM compatibble" meant that the computer
  would run IBM and PC compatible programs.  Did not consider that you would
  need a special printer or printer interface to be able to use the computer.
  My philosophy would say that would be  one more reason NOT to buy an IBM or
  PC compatible, because they don't seem to be compatible with much of anything
  else in the market. I don't like a company telling me I have to buy their
  printer to work with their machine.  Theirs may not always be best.  (and
  usually isn't!)

(Phil) All (non-Tandy ) compats have IBM printer interface.

(Gerald G) More of a question on this topic - Is there any compatibility with
  the 100 and 102 with any ms dos desk top computer whether Tandy, IBM on IBM
  clones?

(Sysop Tony) Not sure I understand that question. ...

(Gerald G) Let me rephrase ...

(Sysop Tony) The Tandy portables will not run IBM/compatible software,
  but they can transfer files to and from.

(Gerald G) Thank you, you answered my question that files can be transferred.
  Thank you 

(Sysop Tony) OK.  By the way,  Phil is the one to thank for that.  He works in
  the MS-DOS world, and developed FLTIBM to use on the IBM/compatible end  to
  transfer files in and out.  And he has probably researched every IBM-type
  telecommunications program, so knows the ins and outs of that. But, myself,
  having come to the personal computer world at the beginning, back in 1978,
   I don't consider *anything* "compatible" unless it can be plugged into any
  computer, and work.  The various schemes of the manufacturers, to make you
  buy everything from them, is self-defeating, I think,  and is a disservice
  to the public.  But then, that's *my* opinion.   Any more on this topic,
  Gerald?

(Gerald G) No, but my only comment is that I am annoyed that Tandy is
  constantly redesigning its existing line, making them incompatible with
  the previous versions.....the TRSdos 6 dos system is an example...but I will
  address that elsewhere.

(Sysop Tony) Tandy has a well-documented history of shooting itself in the
  foot!

(Phil) [Progress, Gerald, progress!!]

(Sysop Tony) OK.... Any new topic????

(Bob H.) Anyone have any comments on the question of  Ultimate Rom II vs.
  Super Rom [besides the $]?

(Sysop Tony) Well, It's generally thought that the UR-2 is superior for
  word-processing oriented users and that Super ROM is superior for
  spreadsheeters. -- You have both here this morning, did you have a specific
  question?

(Bob H.) Yes... in regards to maintaining a bar inventory, what should I use
  to track inventory, that is, daily bottles in and out?

(Sysop Tony) Well, UR-2 has a database program, but that seems like it would
  be a case of overkill just to track an inventory.  Seems like it would be
  best to write up an inventory program just for your application.

(Bob H.) Yeah, but I like overkill.  If I could get something to do it and
  enjoy the benefits of everything else so much the better.  frankly, I've been
  doing it by hand for 2 years  so even the 102 could be called overkill. But
  thanks!

(Phil) I agree with Tony's comments.  Adding (maybe), For spreadsheets, must
  have Super ROM; none in UR-2.  UR-2 has the best word processor/print
  processor for the M100  S-ROM has the best outliner. Both have Data base
  programs, the one in UR-2 is more powerful but slower.  The one in S-ROM
  is similar to the data base capabilities and approach of Lotus 1-2-3 (an
  extension of the spreadsheet system).

(Sysop Tony) Bob, you might consider bar-coding everything, and doing it like
  the big boys do. (grin)

(Bob H.) [too much work]

(RON RIVERS) Is it true that both ROMs discussed can  be easily installed
  without major surgery.

(Sysop Tony) Yep.  there's a little trap door in the bottom of your computer,
  you open it, and there's a socket just waiting for you to plug in one of the
  ROMs.   Just push it in, turn on the computer, issue the CALL to activate
  the program and it appears on your menu.

(RON RIVERS) Are both compatible with 100/102?.

(Sysop Tony) Yes.

(RON RIVERS) (done)

(Sysop Tony) OK  Then we're out of topics, and it's getting close to "Slide
  Time",  where I hold up the slides of my last vacation, and describe them to
  you, ...

(Phil) [Oh, oh]

(Sysop Tony) Ala Ollie North.  (grin)

(RON RIVERS) My name is Ron ...alias Sgt. Rivers  be careful...

(Sysop Tony) Oh oh!

(Phil) Northwest Mounted Police, Ron?  Sorry about that!!

(RON RIVERS) USMC act/status

(Sysop Tony) Shall we talk about the Corps? ???

(RON RIVERS) SERIOUSLY  WHAT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF DOWNLOADING  DIRECTLY TO
  TANDY PDD

(Sysop Tony) Zip!  Zero!  Nil!  Not a chance.  ----  Well, maybe.  It is not
  possible to download direct to the TDD disk. The computer has only one
  communications chip, and when it is being used for the modem, it cannot also
  connect to the RS-232 port, where the disk drive is connected. You can only
  _truly_ download to disk with a drive that is buss connected, like the
  Chipmunk or D/VI. You can, however "simulate" downloading to disk in a
  couple of ways. If you have an external modem, install a switch at the
  RS-232 port, and download a file into RAM, switch back to the modem, and do
  it again. For other approaches see the 3 DSKTRM files in DL3, several DPUSER
  and DPTIP files in DL9 and I also recommend the TDDTIP series of files in
  DL9 (TD2TIP if you have the new TDD-2).

(RON RIVERS) WHAT'S UP WITH NEW 102?...

(Sysop Tony) "Up" in what sense?

(RON RIVERS) DIFFENCE BTWN 102 I BOUGHT LAST YEAR ...

(Phil) [Not new!! one year old]

(RON RIVERS) AND THE ONE RELEASED THIS WEEK?.

(Sysop Tony) I think there is a misconception there...  They released a whole
  new series of computers but not a "new" 102.  Depending on when you bought
  your 102, you may have a buss that can't use certain peripherals. There are
  two versions floating around.  The first ones prevented any buss-connected
  peripherals from working, if they used the interrupt system.  The "new"
  portable .... if it can be called "portable",  the new "laptop", if you
 can call 11 pounds a "laptop" ...

(Phil) [13 pounds!!]

(Sysop Tony) is an MS-DOS machine, and is not compatible with any of the
  current 100/102/200 portables. ....  Oh, 13!  Must have missed that.

(RON RIVERS) ANY POSSIBILITIES FOR HARD  FOR 102/100

(Sysop Tony) ????? Hard?  You mean hard disk?

(RON RIVERS) YES

(Sysop Tony) There is a report of one man in the LA area that has a 10 M byte
   hard disk working on a Model 100.  Denny is trying to track him down,  but
  with several million folks there, it isn't the easiest to do.  Other  than
  that, no one has expressed an interest in hard disks for portables.  Well, I
  take that back... Commodore was supposedly working on one for the C64 line
  that doesn't seem to have come to market.  It would have had to be
  "intelligent", like the TDD, with it's own DOS, and there might have been a
  chance to convert it for the portables.

(Phil) Yes, Denny says one is rumored in North Hollywood.  And if you can find
  it, let's look for the Seven Cities of Gold next! Sure would be feasible --
  but the interface would have to be RS-232 for it to work with 100, 102 and
  200 (or special to each, I guess) Hard disk would be something else, but not
  quite in keeping with the "personality" of these machines!

(Sysop Tony) There are "RAM Disk" devices available now, up to 10 megabytes.
  But they cost an arm and a leg.  I've always been opposed to spending more
  for RAM or peripherals than I did for the computer.

(RON RIVERS) ANY WORD ON  NEW LAPTOP MAGAZINE  IN RECENT ONLINE TODAY...

(Sysop Tony) They are already out of business.  One issue.  Although some
  folks got a second issue,  and it is rumored that a third issue had been
  printed.   See the file LU.THD in DL13 for some comments.  Also, Portable
  100 is reportedly back in business, and some say that's the reason Laptop
  User folded so fast.

(RON RIVERS) NO COMMENT...

(Bob H.) as to magazines, I have the august issue of Portable 100, it was
  recently bought by CW Comm so they should be around for at least a while.
  I've got to run now Any words of advice for a brand new 102 user [not
  new to computing though]

(Sysop Tony) What can one say?  That's not the type of thing one can give
  advice for.  Like in buying a new car, "Any words of advice?" ...

(Bob H.) hah!

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, drive carefully.  What?  You'll either love it, or hate it.
  About 3 months down the road you'll know whether you like it enough to keep
  it.  And if you do you'll be a portable fanatic like the rest of us.

(Bob H.) Thanks , bye all!

(RON RIVERS) LAST QUESTION.  DIFFERENCE BTWN  PORTABLE 100 MAGAZINE AND  PCM
  ESPECIALLY FOR TANDY USERS.

(Sysop Tony) Portable 100 caters to the portables ONLY.  It supports primarily
  the 100/102/200, and maybe a little bit of the 600.  We'll see.  Also the
  other Kyocera portables that are similar to the 100's - the NEC, Olivetti
  M-10, and possibly the Kyotronics-85.  With only one issue out it's kind of
  hard to tell what they are going to support.  PCM on the other hand,
  supports primarily the 1000, 2000, and other desktops, with a little bit
  thrown in for the portables.

(RON RIVERS) HOW DO I SUBSCRIBE?

(Sysop Tony) send your name, address, and money to the publisher.

(RON RIVERS) who is publisher?

(Sysop Tony) Why don't you leave a message on the board with that question.
   It's kind of inconvenient to look that stuff up for you right now.

(RON RIVERS) Sure  thanks for all the helpful info  only my first time in
  conference.

(Sysop Tony) Well, it's just us folks here now. ....  I suggest we close early.

(Phil) [Best support for Ky is in DL15]

(Sysop Tony) Yes, so far.  And probably for all time.  The liquidator, despite
  his plans, doesn't seem to be doing any more for the computer.  But then, he
  only had 1500 units to sell.  Maybe when they were gone his interest flagged,
  or he was on to the next project. 

(Phil) Well, so has mine.  The only one of my new KC-85 files with more
  than ten downloads is the ROM map!  So I will accept requests for KC-85
  developments, but otherwise it's hard to know what (if anything) folks
  want.  And the Kyo-85 goes back east at the end of Aug.  will do a more
  deailed and complete map, though.

(Sysop Tony) Ten Downloads!!!  Why everyone who bought one has downloaded that
  file! You've done a remarkable job, all in all... all things considered.
   But it may be that the Kyo folks, after finding little support here,  moved
  on, and don't come back to check.  It may also be that only a small
  percentage of the Kyo buyers are aware of the forum, and what it has to
  offer. You can't expect all 1500 of them to know about, or subscribe to
  CompuServe.  I tried to get DL to include us in their mailings.... in with
  the units they shipped, but by the time I got to them, they only had a few
  units left anyway.

(Phil) Well, I figure folks may happen by now and again and find the stuff
  but I did it for fun, anyway (by the end it was "some fun" time, tho!) And I
  do encourage the widest distribution of the programs on BBS's etc to find as
  many as possible But without a built in modem, access will always be more of
  an effort than with M100.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, and while you were doing the conversions, you were also
  learning - learning enough to become the resident Kyo "expert".  (grin)
  It'll be interesting to see if you get any other contacts about it than from
  here.   In fact, it will be interesting to see if you get any here, too.
  It has always bothered me that we have so many  who download and use stuff
  without so much as a thank you to the authors. 

(Phil) Found an interesting Basic incompatibility. With M100 you can kill
  an open DO file in an BA program, it seems, But in the Kyo that gives an
  error.  So must close it before killing (as in FLIPML.).

(Sysop Tony) Same thing with the 200... you have to close a file before
  killing it.  Must have to do with the file pointers.  BTW, I was working
  with an interesting program this week that I thought you would appreciate.
  It calculated the effective radiated power of a beam antenna given the gain
  in db, and the output power of a transmitter.  The formula was what was
  interesting.  It seems that in antennas, if you have a 3db gain, you double
  the ERP.  (Effective radiated power).  So the formula, was  ERP = Xmtr Pwr
  * (2^(Ant gain/3))

(Phil) Puzzled re the 2^ part, since dB's are log to base 10. Am I missing
  something?

(Sysop Tony) As I read it, the ERP doubles as a function of the antenna gain
  divided by 3, the db figure.  Thus, if you start with 5 watts, 3 db gain = 10
  watts ERP.  6 db gain = 20 watts ERP, etc.  I'll send you a copy of the
  program to explore.

(Phil) OK -- but don't you mean 2*(gain/3), vs 2^(gain/3) ?

(Sysop Tony) Well, I'll have to look at the program again, but it seems like
  it was ^.  You may be right however.

(Phil) I do this stuff quite a bit for space-ground comm links, but it's all
  in terms of dBi, dBw, etc -- and seldom deals with absolute gain in terms
  of watts, etc.  so all calcs are add and subtract!

(Sysop Tony) Well, it's just us, and it's after 11 am, so let's call this one
to a close.  See you next week, if not before.
