(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, hummm. Interesting. Am I still here?
(Larry L) is any of us really here?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, I'd say this about that in this point in time except
  that this ain't PSYCHO sig.
(Larry L) What was all that?

(Leonard E) greetings and hallucinations..
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Larry, I was testing a new feature of the forum software.
  It appeared to have worked since we're still connected in CO.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Len, I'm able to (CENSORED) ...
  That is the gnu stuff here.
(Leonard E) gee, is that just sysops? or can all of us do it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Everyone can do it, though I may cut this out of the
  transcript, but the sysop can (CENSORED) if the thing is abused.
(Leonard E) [good!]
(Mike A.) That'd be nice!


(Larry L) I just wanted to make a couple of Radio Shack announcements.  They
 are having a sale on the Bar Code Readers ($39.95).  Also, They have started
 selling a 5 outlet telephone block so you can keep all of your devices
 connected at once.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Thanks Larry, though sometimes I think that Danny at PCM
  magazine is the only bar code reader user.


(Jeff Streutker) I use SXM a lot, but can't seem to have it send out my
 autologin sequence.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tee hee, fella t'other day was saying that XMODEM.312 had a
  bug and only SXM would log him on properly. Have you set your PROFILE, or
  DEFALT, are in accordance with instructions?? "VIDTEX query" should be OFF.
(Jeff Streutker) Do you mean instructions in the SXM.DOC file?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, but also what I just asked you about PROFILE and TERMINAL
  settings.
(Leonard E) I 'd suggest trying that 'patch' to xmodem (don't know if it works
 with sxm) to use the CALL to the ROM autolog routine. much more reliable!!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Leonard, as I told the fella t'other day, there are many
  thousands using XMODEM.312 as produced by Rick Perry and the supposed bug is
  sump'n that has just been claimed. Methinks VIDTEX query is the main fault.
(Jeff Streutker) I have absolutely no idea what you mean by profile, terminal,
 and vidtex settings.  Do you mean Profiles settings on CIS?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is correct; GO PROFILE or GO DEFALT and check your
  TERMINAL settings, see PROFLE.CIS in DL 3 or DEFALT.HLP in DL 1.
(Jeff Streutker) It looks like you misunderstood. I mean that whenever I use
 it, even with BBS's It says "auto login"  but never does do the sequence.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oh! Thought you meant CompuServe only. In that case, double
  czech the SXM.DOC and query the author's User ID or mebbe Denny Thomas.
(Leonard E) Jeff, are you using the internal modem or an external?
(Jeff Streutker) Internal.
(Leonard E) well, that eliminates one prob. next step is to check the actual
 autolog data in your entries in ADRS.DO.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [Denny Thomas 73126,672]
(Phil W) are you able to log onto compuserve automatically in TELCOM?
(Jeff Streutker) Yes, I do it via Tymnet via DataPac....
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Oh HO!
(Phil W) [Oh!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) None of the autolog programs will work with DataPac to the
  best of my knowledge. NONE! Including the SOOPER-DOOPERs for the IBM family.
  That explain??
(Jeff Streutker) Nope, because I always can autologin to CIS using normal
 TELCOM. and I also have the problem with local BBS's.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes, DataPac will accept the built in Telcom of the Model 100
  but not other stuff.
(Phil W) Jeff, put your BBS and CIS log on strings from adrs (with dummy pwds!)
 in a message oon the SIG so we can take a look at them.  Only way to go!
(Leonard E) I thought that most of the auto-log progs used a ROM call for
 autolog with the internal modem. That *should* work the same if not, try
 changing the adrs to 21443.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I'd say that following Phil's suggestion of sample ADRS.DO
  from your file in a message to Denny Thomas at above User ID in message S3
  would be the way to go.


(Phil W) On a similar subject. One of the nice features of EMA59 by EJ is that
 it will do auto-logon with the acoustic cups.  Nice for hotel rooms, etc.
 I am in the process of stripping out that part of the program to build a
 litttle ACPLOG program which does the same without all the EMA features for
 message send/rcv etc.  But has it been done already?  Is there such a program
 in DL3 somewhere?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Phil, there may be but I'm not sure. Eiji just finished the
  catalogs for that Data Library and you'd probably want a copy of TERMNL.CAT
  anyway!!
(Phil W) Well, I got the correct CAT yesterday (I think).  But the DES's are
 not always that complete. But I'm not sure I got TERMNL.CAT; seems like the
 logon pgms were described as being elsewhere.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmm, just looked this morning because Eiji finished last
  night and he included auto-dialing in the description; but I haven't looked
  at TELCOM.CAT's description.
  In anyhooo, I'm not sure.


(Leonard E) think I should put together a 'skeleton' prog for autolog? for both
 internal external of course (combo of my routines, QHAYES & XM312 routines...)
 works great.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Leonard, first you'd best inspect Howard's LOGON.TXT in DL 3.
  Methinks that you have sump'n more fancy in mind. Good!
(Leonard E) Well, I *could* upload my attack dialer, works at 300/1200 or with
 the internal modem, does autologs, can use a file other than adrs.do (off disk
 for example). And you can *reliably* interrupt the attack dailer to return to
 searching for a # to call (3 tries/min attack)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Sounds good to me!! Not a "war games" dialer is it??
(Leonard E) NO!!!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, then send it along!! Sounds interesting!!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Editorial comment, for FOOD SIG ...
  Celantano's frozen cannelloni ain't very good. Just finished it; fills tummy
  and that's it!!
  {bak tu chik-chik}


(Sysop .^Dave^.) I cut you off and you can currently say nothing Leonard.
   (CENSORED)
  is that what you got Curtis ??
  [just a second Leonard, and I'll let you back in.]
(Curtis G)  Yes Dave. Cute feature
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, Leonard we only (CENSORED)
  VERY GOOD!!
(Leonard E) ?cute feature  ...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Welcome back Leonard!!
(Leonard E) you were right. If you hadn't *told* me I wouldn't have known!
 CIS kept (CENSORED)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Aha! You mean it looked to you as though (CENSORED)
(Leonard E) well... or so. But when I (CENSORED) after that, it looked ok
 from *this* end!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) So if I hadn't told you that you were cut off you would have
  been doing a slow burn wondering why I ignored you!
  The command, for the cognoscenti, is (CENSORED)
  but don't waste your time trying it!!
(Leonard E) gee wonder what (CENSORED) would do?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mebbe your cumpooter would implode!!
(Leonard E) no, I meant if *you* tried it!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmm, that is a GOOD question. I'll try it. If you don't hear
  from me for a few months ....
(Leonard E) one finger slip and ooops!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yup, I was able to (CENSORED) myself but also able to
  (CENSORED) myself!
(Leonard E) cute!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is, I was (CENSORED) unless you all ...
(Curtis G) No
(Leonard E) nopez !
(Curtis G) Is that a Sysop command only?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yea verily!! But there is another command that I think YOU can
  use when you're sick of one person's drivvle but don't want to cut off
  everybody; try the /SQU command, I think it is.
(Curtis G) I understand the command.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rather obviously, a CO moderator couldn't very well make good
  use of /SQU command.


(SAM M) problems with the various ROM chips such as UR2
(Sysop .^Dave^.) What kind of problem?? You know that Traveling supports their
  product here? All we got Sam, was problems with UR2. 
(SAM M) From Tom Bennett of PEaC: There is a problem with the NEC CRT
 that prevents it from working with any option ROM chips, such as UR2
 Do you know about this?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, don't know about that at all, but suggest you leave a
  query on the message board for Traveling Software 76466,15 as they're in very
  close cooperation with Bennett.


(Jeff Streutker) My ADRS file has been sent to Denny.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) One of the ESSENTIAL bits in an ADRS.DO that is oft overlooked
  is the starting < and the closing > for all stuff that is calling another
  computer. Not used for calling the weather reports, or your wife's lover,
  but whenever calling another computer the <> are essential.


(RossR) Hey Dave! What is the best way to communicate with you about mods to
 DBASES.600?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, depending on the size of the communication ...
  You have the options of:
  1) Using message board, S8
  2) EasyPlex
  3) 301-252-5379
  4) Address in the file.
(RossR) Ok .. then just a quickie for now.
 That is: Can you modify code easily enough to hande a file with 12-16 fields?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No sweat at all!
  Annnnnd, I'm working on another program that accesses three of the FILE
  databases simultaneously to prepare reports.
(RossR) Egg salad! I guess it'd be best if i Write You about my specific
 request.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay. Whatever you have in mind. Seems there is a LOT to make
  use of in the Tandy 600 that has been barely scratched. Just received the
  Technical Manual.
(RossR) Thankee .. your enthusiasm is catching as always.

(Jeff Streutker) Is there a better way of dumping ASCII to the leave message
 editor? I mean, I've been having problems. I separate my paragraphs with blank
 lines and made the mistake of dumping it on the editor... and screwing up.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Jeff, there are several files in DL 1 that deal with that.
  See SAVMON.HLP as well as FAST.DOC. Clearly you are using SEDitor which takes
  a blank line as the end of the file indicator. Strongly suggest you switch
  from SEDitor to the EDIT editor, but see recommended files.
(Jeff Streutker) Thanks again.  I rarely use this SIG because of the DataPac
 bills.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Understandable!! But we have 2300 files of great help for
  you and all!! Note that you can use a period at the beginning of a line for
  a blank line but must be sure to start next paragraph with either a space or
  TAB or period before the first word in order to force a new line.
  That's QUICK TUTOR [#5.z7^5d]


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Neil, you working on any Season Specials for DL 6?
  (graphics/music)
(Neil Wick) Actually, I've been working on a LOGO language program lately.
 The only thing I'd like to add before uploadin a version is capability of
 doing nested loops.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, sure hope that your production makes more sense to me
  than what I saw in some magazine a few months back.
  Good luck on the documentation!!
(Rich W) are you saying you will have a m100 logo? if so, I'd love to get it.
 My daughter is using apple logo in 1st grade & I'd like her to be able to
 practice at home.
(Neil Wick) Yes, M100 Logo.  It's fairly limited at the present time, but I
 will upload it soon with the present capabilities it has.
(Rich W) will it look to the user like apple logo?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [or apricot golo?]
(Neil Wick) Basically, there is very small differences likely to appear.
 The only thing is it will be a sub-set of the full Logo language.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gollleeeeee,,,,,, sure hope we don't get in trouble
  for pre-announcing pre-announced software that is almost, about to be just
  about ready for upload!! mebbe.
  [chwikkle, chwikkle]


(Rich W) OK...I still have not received a P100 mag even tho they keep telling
 me on the phone that it is 'in the mai'; they also told me Sept, Oct, & nov
 are being combined into Dec issue.. Anyone else get last issue yet?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Your report has about the same uniqueness
  as "the sun rises every day."
  No joy in Camden Communications land.


(Neil Wick) I was just wondering if anyone had a look at 102DIF.INF with a view
 to adding to the explanations of 102 differences.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Most likely we'll have to wait for a dedicated M/L programmer
  to get his hands on and busy with the Tandy 102. Am sure folks have copied
  the file but have no idea what anyone might be doing with it.


(Tony R) For information, Kangaroo Products, makers of the ChipTote bag, admits
 a problem with the YKK zipper.  They're offering to replace the closing
 mechanism for $15 if the bag is returned to them.  Seems the enamel wears
 off and the zipper won't close.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Tony, thankee kindlee and with that,
  I'll close the CO as far as controlled moderating is concerned.
