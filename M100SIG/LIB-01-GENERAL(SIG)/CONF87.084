(BOB H.) HI

(Sysop Tony) Good Morning.

(BOB H.) YES  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW  IF ANY ONE HAS TRANSLATED  THE HIDDEN
  POWERS OF THE 100 FOR THE 200.

(Sysop Tony) No.... but any good programmer for the 200  can make necessary
  conversions from the 100 book,  using available matching ROM routine lists.

(BOB H.) OK  MY OTHER QUESTION IS  IF I TRY TO USE MY 200  WITH THE TDD2
  PLUGGED IN OFF OR ON IT FOULS UP MY LOGON WITH COMPUSERVE  IS THIS A KNOWN
  BUG.

(Sysop Tony) That seems to be an impossibility. .... I'm not saying  it
  doesn't happen to you, but it's like saying I can't read a book because the
  refrigerator is running.  There is no reason that having a disk drive plugged
  into the RS-232 port should prevent you from,  or interfere with, use of the
  modem port.

(BOB H.) WELL I GUESS THAT I WILL  HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER.

(Sysop Tony) Phil, who's just joined us  has a TDD-2, but not a 200.  Phil, is
  there any reason that having a TDD2 connected to the RS-232 port, should
  interfere with logging onto CompuServe?

(Phil) No, none that I know of.  But I have not done so with it connected and
  the internal modem  Will go try now on the other line and report back.

(Sysop Tony) OK.. thanks. Meanwhile, ga Rush

(R Caley) ok  I've used the A&J Microdrive  which connects to the RS 232 and
  never had any problems.

(Sysop Denny) The STATs get messed with, don't they? If they didn't get
 }Hchanged back, it might be a problem.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, status get's changed when you access a disk,
  but that wouldn't interfere with CompuServe logon, since  you'd have to be
  in the right status in order to connect to the modem.

(Sysop Denny) Ok, but if you've changed to 8 bit, when you do not have that set
  up in your defaults, it'll not logon.

(Sysop Tony) I don't think that's the problem since you'd have to reset your
  status to M-whatever, before you could even get to the modem, to logon.  The
  question involved problems with the auto-logon, ...

(Phil) [test results await]

(Sysop Tony) once connected... Let's hear some more commments.  ga Bob ga.

(Phil) [works fine!]

(BOB H.) I ONLY DISCONNECTED THE TDD2  AND THIS TRIED AGAIN  AND IT WORKED OK 
  I HAD TRIED IT MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE DISCONNECTING THE TDD2 SO I DON'T THINK
  IT COULD BE THE STATS.

(Phil) I just  came in on my Model 100 with TDD2 atached and on using the
  internal modem.  Worked fine!  Should note, tho, that I did not have FLOPPY2
  installed at the time, and possibly that does something -- since it
plays with maxram.

(Sysop Tony) Any more on that Bob?

(BOB H.) NO I WILL HAVE TO TRY IT AGAIN  MAYBE I'M DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

(Sysop Tony) OK, Maybe it was a one time foulup.

(BRIAN P.) Good morning or afternoon.
  Please identify topic:

(Sysop Tony) No special topic today: Your choice!

(BRIAN P.) Ah!  good.  Having logon problems.  My 100 is not sending the 
  password on CIS, using m7e1e and ?: as the prompt.  Please help

(Sysop Tony) You should use the lower case letter d.

(BRIAN P.) I tried that too; doesn't work.

(Sysop Denny) Hmm..On the 7E1E, try M7I1E. You'll probably get less errors.  I
  was going to say use a small d also.

(Sysop Tony) Brian, ...

(BRIAN P.) thanks, tony! Might work elsewhere, but here in california, yes

(Sysop Tony) show us EXACTLY what you are using from the ? on. And we'll see
  if we can spot an error.  Because contrary to your experience, it does work.

(BRIAN P.) M7E1E FOR PROTOCOL; ?:PASSWORD IT DID IN THE PAST  great, I'll try
  the m7i1e and ?: or ?dpassword

(Sysop Tony) Do you have ^M after the password?

(BRIAN P.) yes

(Sysop Tony) Well, there's no reason that it shouldn't work.  CompuServe has
  not singled out your node, and changed the software.  Either try again, or
  leave a message on the board, showing ...

(BRIAN P.) That's what the phone company says Please thanks

(Sysop Tony) your entire logon string, and let someone try to deciper it.  It
  may be that you are using an illegal character in your string.

(BRIAN P.) another topic regarding yes, I thought Bob was going to comment

(BOB H.) I FOUND THAT SOME OF THE SPECIAL CHAR HAVE TO BE USED CAREFULLY
   BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIAL FUNCTIONS FOR AUTOLOG ON.

(R Caley) ok  In 1983, I copied the autolog from pg. 92  in the manual and
  never have changed since...I think the problem might be  1 of 2 things  He
  may have forgotten the control C or the "=" sign or  in a long text string
  he may have accidentally gotten a carriage return where the sequence  is
  supposed to wrap around

(BOB H.) NO MORE FROM ME.

(BRIAN P.) Yes.  Just to comment on the = suggestion.  I currently insert the
  two second = before the ^C at the beginnning of the sign on, but no where
  else.  Is that what has been referred to?

(Sysop Tony) Yes  You can insert the = sign anywhere in the string, and it's
  an illegal character in the password.

(BRIAN P.) My turn?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.  I was answering your question.

(BRIAN P.) Sorry, the operation of this CB is a bit erratic for me.
  Another topic when you get a chance regarding the System 100 a&J
  microdrive and use of hooked machine language and basic progrms

(Sysop Tony) OK, Brian, let's put you back in the lineup, and we'll get back
  to  those. 

(Gerald G) ok  With the problems of my TDD2 I feel I should join Masochists
  Anonymous Perhaps we can see what the problems is here  How can I determine
  if the TDD2 or utility disk is working....if the connecting cable is right
  (should be) I cannot even get an error code.

(Sysop Tony) Phil, can you deal with this one?  ga Phil

(Phil) Well, gerald, we need to hear what IS happening and what  you ARE
  doing, not what is not happening.  I assume you are not able to boot FLOPPY.
   Right?

(Gerald G) Yes, the cable that came with the portable disk drive 2 (Tandy) is
  in the 232c.

(Phil) Forget the cable -- since that is pretty  sturdy stuff.  You must do
  the boot EXACTLY as specified - Utility disk must be write-protected (little
  tab window open). Drive must be OFF when you hit run <enter> after typing in
  the boot program:

  10 RUN"COM:98N1E":SAVE"IPL"  RUN  <ENTER>

  Note also  that the colon between " and Save is missing in the manual, and
  must be there.  Are you doing this ALL as I just described, Gerald?

(Gerald G) I think so, without that colon there is a SN error....  Also, I
  believe you said turn the drive off, type the program, turn drive on, type
  run and <enter>. Right?

(Phil) NOPE -- type RUN <ENTER> and only then turn the drive on.

(Sysop Tony) [RUN <ENTER> - Turn drive on]  [Dumb!]

(Gerald G) How can I determine if the drive or the utility disk is
  functioning I tried variations of what was said here and on the board?

(Phil) Try it in another drive; try another Util disk -- substitution!
  Gerald ...

(Gerald G) If I made a mistake how could I get a disk error code?

(Phil) Have you EVER gotten it to work???

(Gerald G) No, no error codes, when the program is typed without the colon
  there is a ...

(Phil) [Error codes are in FLOPPY -- must boot it before getting them!]

(Gerald G) SN error, but no whatever variations I used there is nothing on
  the display.

(Phil) Let me rephrase.  Have you ever successfully loaded FLOPPY?

(Gerald G) NO.

(Phil) AH -- well that could be a hardware or disk defect.  Take it back  to
  RS and get them to deal with it.  BTW -- what computer?

(Gerald G) Tony, I am a novice at this perhaps even an alien and what is
  elementary to some of you is unknown to me.

(Sysop Tony) Are you finished with that topic, Gerald?

(Phil) Gerald, what computer?

(Gerald G) Well, I will log off give it another try and see what happens,
  perhaps it is the software or hardware.

(Sysop Tony) Gerald, what computer?

(Gerald G) model 100.  Using a model 4 at this moment.

(Sysop Tony) OK....  editorial comment:  You did fine, Gerald, no need to
  appologize for anything.  In fact, you handled the CO like a pro.   There
  are many who did not do as well as you.  Many who fail to read
  either the CONFER.HLP file, or the NEWCO.HLP file in DL1  but come in, and
  don't know what's going on.   Now, Bill is next, and Brian has some
  questions waiting.

(Bill T) Two questions... first is... what would you all consider ...

(Brian P.) Pardon me, but this procedure Who's one me or Bill?

(Bill T) Marvin Miller's best program in the DL's?

(Sysop Tony) Marvin's principle contribution  has been the Auto-Email
  programs.  He updates them by replacing the old with the new,  so whatever
  is there is the latest in that series.

(Bill T) so it's probably EMAIL.MMM?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know.  With over 3000 files available, we don't generally
  keep track of who wrote what or which of their files is "the Best".

(Phil) [EM8SIG?]

(Bill T) so I should go to DL3 and use S[PPN]... correct?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, if you want to see what files have been written  by a
  specific person.

(Bill T) second question... how can an upload contain the wrong ID#...

(Sysop Tony) What do you mean, "Wrong ID Number?

(Bill T) When I recently uploaded WAND.100 to DL14  you said my ID# was not
  correct and that the contents of my upload  was not correct, even after I
  used Phil's latest QKRCHK.CO to calculate the checksum...

(Sysop Tony) Oh. In your file, you typed your name and PPN.  When you typed
  the PPN you typed "85" instead of "75".  Can't you see that in the copy you
  have there?  If I change that here, by editing the file, I have to also
  change the description, to put in the new checksum number.  While I CAN do
  it, it's not normally reasonable that folks should upload things, expecting
  the sysop to "fix it up" once it's here.   Since upload time is free, it's
  better if you change the original file,  and reupload it, yourself.

(Bill T) That answers my questions... will make corrections and reupload  I
  appreciate all your help, Tony... didn't realize what the problem was.

(Sysop Tony) Oh, I see.  You didn't catch my meaning that the error was IN the
  file!  Sorry about that.  I thought you'd check the file, and see it.

(Bill T) Just toss m} prior uploads in the bit-bucket  and I'll re-upload a
  corrected version... I'm all done.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Brian was next, with some very good questions.  But he
  decided to leave, and so we have no one waiting.

(Bill T) Club 100 wants to honor Marv by using his latest and best  EMAIL
  program for our 'Program of the Week' so, wanted to make sure I have the
  right one.

(Sysop Tony) I don't track such things, and he hasn't been very active here
  lately.  Most likely because he's been very ill.

(Sysop Denny) Actually, the email programs are just  modifications of Ed
  Juge's original works the latest is really just a small modification.
  Marv's main original work is EM8SIG  The current version is updated for use
  with the latest software.

(Bill T) Thanks, Denny!  end

(Sysop Tony) OK.... Gerald is up next.  ga Gerald

(Gerald G) About the TDD2 and that is all for this week  When the drive is
  turned on is the low battery indicator supposed to flash...mine doesn't...
  what about typing Maxfiles=2,, before the program.

(Sysop Tony) That's likely to flicker as the circuits get power  but it's not
  absolutely mandatory that it do that.  After all, it's supposed to indicate
  low battery power.   If it doesn't come on, your batteries are probably OK.
  I wouldn't worry about that; it's not likely to be the source of your
  problem.   As for maxfiles, why would you want to set that to 2?  Why not set
  the date to Feb 12, 1932?

(Gerald G) Perhaps, you notice a board message to me to type maxfiles=2 before
  running the program or what did the writer mean?

(Sysop Tony) I don't know. I didn't notice that message.  But it seems to me
  that many users try to make this whole thing more complicated than it really
  is.  If one follows the directions in the manual, it usually works out.  In
  this case, the manual has a misprint in it, but that's been well documented.
   If you STILL can't get it to work, then it's not likely that "advice" will
  get it to work.  Take it back!

(Gerald G) Your last sentence before ga seems the most logical solution to the
  problem. Thank you.

(Phil) Most defintitely, should take it back if you cannot get it to work even
  once!  BTW -- by documented, Tony refers to the TD2TIP files in DL9.  Good
  advise,there! ga and done

(Sysop Tony) Plus the fact that it's been mentioned on the board ...

(Gerald G) I read the file, can anyone define "cold start"?

(Sysop Tony) several times, even by Dave Thomas.  Who wants to define "cold
  start" for Gerald?  (tee hee)

(Bill H.) [brrr]

(Phil) USEFUL.100 (DL7) does a good simulation!

(Sysop Tony) No one, I guess...  Gerald, a "Cold Start" is what we call it ...

(Gerald G) Does that refer to the problem with the TDD2?

(Sysop Tony) when something goes amiss in the computer,  and it suddenly goes
  back to the main menu, and everything is gone.   All the files, all the
  programs, are no longer~r listed on the main menu.  It appears as if
  everything in memory has been wiped out.   It's as if your machine was
  suddenly brain washed.  The system pointers have all been reset to what they
  were when you first took the computer out of the box.  However, all that
  stuff is still in RAM, and you can recover it ... probably.... if you do it
  right then, and know what to do.  But it's a traumatic experience the first
  time.   Since you can also do it intentionally, it's a quick method of
  wiping your memory clean, in preparation to doing someting else.

(Gerald G) I believe there is a co. file in one of the dl about that?

(Sysop Tony) There is a file in DL9 that tells how to recover.  There is no
  file that I can think of that tells you how to intentionally cause a cold
  start. It's a direct BASIC CALL.

(Gerald G) Do you know the file name to recover?

(Sysop Tony) RECOVR.101. (DL9)

(Gerald G) Thank you very much.

(Sysop Tony) Well, it looks like it's slide time.  WARNING!!!  It's slide
  time!

(Bill H.) [slides are better since you moved to gods country]

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm.... lots of philosphical insights relating to the phrase
  "God's Country". --  Just us sysop-type folks, and Bill here.  If no one
   has any pressing questions, we might as well close this conference early,
  and save you all some connect charges.  Any objections?

(Phil) Anyone notice that just as Tony spelled backwards is ynoT, God spelled
  backwards is doG? Food for heavy thought!

(Sysop Tony) There are a lot of interesting words like that  LIVE is one of
  them.  And "Lives" is an anagram of Elvis ...

(Phil) [consider it as a verbal slide!]

(Sysop Tony) which supposedly "proves" that Elvis is still alive!  I like the
  oxymorons.  those words, which used in a phrase, are self-cancelling  like
  "Military Intelligence" anyone think of any more?

(Phil) Well, sayonara -- back to my 52 page tome!

(Bill H.) ok  here goes  as you probably have read  there is a problem with
  SHOOTERS on the freeways in Los Angeles and ...

(Sysop Tony) Don't blame ME... I left town.

(Bill H.) Supervisor Hahn has the answer of  banning the sale of TOY guns
  so I have come up with the idea of  banning toy cars to eliminate smog and
  congestion on the streets.

(Sysop Tony) That's a logical extension!  Actually, the "Toy Gun" issue is an
  interesting question.  there have been a number of cases where kids with toy
  guns have been mistaken for criminals and shot by police officers, who were
  acting in what they thought was self defense... a life threatening
  situation.  While I'm not in favor of restricting guns themselves,  I'd be
  in favor of doing something about the toy imitations.  I understand there
  are now realistic imitations of Uzi machine guns, and several others, which
  are very difficult to tell from the real thing.

(Bill H.) thats true...  It is indicative of the atmosphere we now live in.
  everyone is running scared including the police

(Dana Hyde) Great to see Portable 100 back!

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I suppose so. ..... If they could get my subscription
  straightened out.  Neither Denny nor I are getting it yet.  Any more, Dana?

(Dana Hyde) Only that  I'm glad to see Eiji here, as a fellow DVI enthusiast.

(Eiji) I haven't gotten my subscription, either ...

(Sysop Tony) Really?  I didn't know Eiji was interested in the DVI.

(Eiji) and no one that I know of has received subscription  No, I don't have
  DVI, Dana.

(Dana Hyde) Sorry, I thought you did.

(Sysop Tony) Eiji, it may because all three of us moved last year.  Whatever
  was sent to the old address may have gone back undeliverable. ....  I have
  written them, but no response.

(Eiji) Well, I told them address change last Aug.

(Sysop Tony) That may have been lost  along with the 2 year renewal I sent in.
   When they stopped publishing, they may have also stopped working on the
  subscription lists.  There was a while there that they continued to accept
  subsciptions, and money without publishing.

(Dana Hyde) CW/P is trying hard to rectify the situation  They can be reached
  at 603-924-9471.

(Sysop Tony) Then why didn't they answer my letter?  Hmmm? Hmmm?  Hmmmm?
  We'll see. Looks like we're running out of time. Any last minute questions?

(Eiji) Has anyone seen Sept. issue yet?

(Sysop Tony) No, but I hear it's out ...

(Dana Hyde) Yes, I have both Aug and Sept

(Sysop Tony) and several subscribers got it in the mail.  there's one now.

(Eiji) ok.  that's all.  thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.
