                    How to get Destructive Backspace
                    --------------------------------
On CompuServe, the normal way that you delete characters leaves the characters
still visible, even though they are gone from the line that you are typing.
If you've ever wondered how you can get a backspace to erase the characters
that you are deleting, here is a method that will permanently set your CIS
parameters to do so.

First, type <PRO><Enter> at any prompt. This will get you into the area where
the change can be made. You will see an OK prompt (as in BASIC) that will
tell you that you've arrived.

Next, type:

<TER LIST LOCAL><Enter>

The following will print out:

T        RATE = 300  (Local)
T        RATE = 1200  (Local)
T        RATE = 2400  (Local)

OK

Next, enter <TER MOD T BSE ON><Enter>
An * will appear at which time you type <DONE><Enter>
If all goes well, you should get another OK prompt from which you have to
GO somewhere. (Preferably, GO M100SIG!) You cannot exit by just hitting
<Enter>, T or M.

Once you have done this procedure it will become effective the NEXT time you
log on. If you have more than one user ID, or log on at different baud rates,
you must repeat the above procedure for each combination. It will become
immediately apparent when you have lost the function of the distructive
backspace.
