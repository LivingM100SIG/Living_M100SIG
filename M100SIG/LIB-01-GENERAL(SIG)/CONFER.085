(larry l) Thinking of buying a multifunction ROM; where is the file comparing
 UROM and Super rom?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, not sure there is a compare file but let me peek my
  INDEX a second. That's waht I thought; we have review SUPER.REV but nothing
  on URII that I know of at the moment.
(larry l) thanks..do you have a preference?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Haven't use SUPER at all; not impressed with Tandy's offering;
  generally spreadsheet users prefer Super and writers prefer URII but there
  seems to be an upsurge of Super support as members here write their own
  Manual support.


(Eric S.) Hello.  Looked in the Sig For info on System 100 and couln't find
 Any.  Is there?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Eric, try the command BRO/KEY A&J or BRO/KEY WAFER in the DL 6
  area. Know there are some files in support [very few] in DL 5 but can't find
  the names at the moment. BRO in the manner shown.
(Eric S.) Had any dealings with it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, it's a retrogression in my opinion.
(Denny) [filename:AJ100.MSG in DL6]
(larry l) I tried the system 100 a couple of months ago. It seemed to work but
 interfered with my PCSG RAM and I sent it back; as a cheap storage drive
 it's not bad, but the Op Sys is in a ML program and can conflict.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) wasn't there sump'n about having to call A&J to reboot
  everytime you had a cold start?
(larry l) yes; the op sys was to be downloaded to ram and then assembled,
 though you could save to cassette tape after downloading and the os is
 relocatable. it just wasnt worth the effort..I still download programs as text
 files to my Apple.


(BILL ERIKSEN) I'm on my new 600. It feel sooooo gooood. Now, where is that
 data base you have hidden around here?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) we have textual files supporting the 600 in DL 1 and DL 4
  as well as programs in every DL from 0 to 4; use the comand BRO/KEY 600 to
  see them all. DBASES.600 is the database manager program but, of course, you
  must have the Basic ROM chip; see DBASES.DOC !
(BILL ERIKSEN) I want to get the basic chip but haven't got it yet. I was also
 having difficulty with the autologon to compuserve.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Bill, see the files TEL001.600 to TEL005.600 for help with the
  Telcom program. Whilst waiting for Basic you might collect the *.DAT and
  *.FIL files from DL 2 that are used by the Basic programs but can be used
  alone while waiting.
  Last thought, hope you've upgraded 32K won't take you far!


(Curtis G) Does anyone know of a program that will allow changing of Folder or
 Disk names in the Chipmunk system?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, see RENAME.CHP in the DL 5 database.  Curtis, please note
  that it will not change FILE names but only the folder or disk names.


(Gerry J. Elman) There's a program for the IBM PC that emulates the M100 Text
 and Telcom functions.  It's called Telecommuter by SIGEA SYSTEMS.  They're
 sending out free demo disks.  Anyone had any experience with it?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Gerry, except for the file transfer capabilities from 100 to
  desktop, Telecommuter really h'ain't a topic for this SIG ....
  BUT!! I've been a Beta tester of Telecommuter for some time; same company
  that does X-TEL.CO. An excellent program.
(Gerry J. Elman) Good to hear.  I couldn't get the demo disk to dial using my
 Popcom modem. But I like the idea of learning M100 commands and then using
 them on the PC.  Easier to teach new employees.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Very true Gerry. If it helps any, I'll say that I use
  Telecommuter for 95% of my Tandy 1000 use. COnference is the only thing
  I don't use it for.
(Gerry J. Elman) Do you have the function whereby you can use the M100 from a
 remote location to control the PC?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes. I have the Corporate version.
(Gerry J. Elman) How about their multilevel file security?
 Does it work for you?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Have only mildly tested it since I'm the only user.


(Gerry J. Elman) I recently got a D/VI.  Have downloaded files from DL4 etc.
 Very helpful. But it's still tricky to disconnect and take m100 back on the
 road.  Usually the screen goes blank and has to be rebooted.  Any advice?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Never played with the D/VI myself. Most of the support files
  are in DL 5 though there is a helpful review type file in DL6. See DVI.CAT
  for more. Tony Anderson has one now, Maddi Durholz and Woods Martin are the
  D/VI gooorooos though.
(Gerry J. Elman) I've already broken one prong off the connector. Luckily it
 doesn't seem to be an essential one. Very poorly designed for connection and
 disconnection. They seem to have remedied that on the M200 with a different
 bus configuration.
 and one of the multi-ram add-ons seems to adopt that M200 plug.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And the Model 102 has the same connector as the Tandy 200.


(JIM) NEED TO REPLY TO CONTROL E INWUIRY FOR REAL TIME TELEX VIA TRT, ITT, ETC.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Now then to embed the CTRL-E in your autologon sequence,
  within the <>  of ADRS.DO press CTRL-P and then CTRL-E where the ^E is
  needed. Never tried it myself but I got somebody up and running with it.
(JIM) some terminal like 3m & RCA have program to allow this auto response.
 can not find program for 100.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) you might try ^E first; that is, upper case 6 and E
  same as ^M in the autologon for here.


(Ralf Burghart) Is there any solution to disable the <BREAK>-key under Basic?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) For all intents and purposes ...
  NO. But see BREAK.KEY in DL 4 for some thoughts.


(ORLOVE, MICHAEL J.) SORRY THE DISPLAY IS TO FAST FOR ME TO READ, WHEN READING
 FROM BRO IN A DL. HOW DO YOU MAKE IT CONTINUE WHERE YOU LEFT OFF THE LAST
 SESSION?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Michael, you cant unless you use the command BRO *.*
  and browse alphabetically which would be a waste of money since we have the
  CAT files for each DL. Not easy to pick up from last session but you could
  download if you are only BROwsing for a limited time past. Download the .CAT
  file needed. Start with CATLOG.CAT in DL 9. Then pick what you need.
(ORLOVE, MICHAEL J.) CAN YOU LIMIT TO A KEYWORD?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mike, see DOWNLD.HLP or Bulletin #4 for assistance and please
  see UPLOAD.HLP too.
(ORLOVE, MICHAEL J.) OK I WON'T KEEP YOU AS I AM SURE YOU ARE VERY! BUSY WITH
 THE OTHERS  THANKS
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay, good luck Mike.


(BILL ERIKSEN) Back to my 600; which data base did you write?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) If you mean which data base manager for the 600, I wrote all
  that are here to the best of my knowledge; off the top of my head PAYROL,
  CHECKS, DBASES and all the .FIL and .DAT files.
(BILL ERIKSEN) my application uses both text and numbers for inventory control
 etc. Which db do you think would be best?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Bill, until you get the Basic ROM chip it is kinda hard for
  you to picture what goes on. DBASES will most likely be the basis for your
  efforts but will require modification per DBASES.DOC. The program will access
  your text/number data in a FILE, that is the beauty of the 600.
(BILL ERIKSEN) I plan to get the Basic chip this next week. Speaking of chips,
 is there anything like Multiplan and basic on the same chip for the 600?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, and not likely to be so either. Basic takes more than
  33K. That is why I asked you how much RAM you have. What is possible, and
  what I do, is copy Basic ROM to RAM and then put PLAN in the ROM slot.
(BILL ERIKSEN) Can i then copy basic to disk?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes. Actually I copied ROM to disk first, and then to RAM.
(BILL ERIKSEN) I only have 32k now but will upgrade soon.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Upgrade is mandatory. Useless gadget with only 32K.


(RossR) Pretyy simple ?  How do I , once at the DL6 prompt for example,
 then begin to read messages posted only to that subject?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not possible to read ANY messages from the Data Library.
  Whacha want to do??
(RossR) Read messages petaining to subject such as Products & Reviews
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Then at the "Function: " prompt where you arrive on the SIG,
  not the DL prompt, use the command SS 6 and then you will be able to read
  ONLY messages in Subtopic 6 and ONLY if you have that as a selected Subtopic.
  When finished with 6, use SS ALL, or SS 3, or whatever you then want.
(RossR) Okay .. How about reading messages (all) from a particular user ID?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) The command is ....
  RS;F;76703,446;0
  to read all FROM somebody
  or
  RS;T;76703,446;0
  to read all TO somebody
  or 
  RS;S;JUNK;0
  to read all on the subject of JUNK, JUNKET, or JUNKERS.
  See MESSAG.HLP in DL 0 for further details.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yooo hooo?
