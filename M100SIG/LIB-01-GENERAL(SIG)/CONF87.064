(Larry L) I see that RS is selling  the 600 for $600 [coincidental?]...and  I
  was wondering how MS-DOS compatible it is and how good a value it could be
  considered?

(Sysop Tony) Radio Shack has been selling out the 600 for several months now.
  And it's available by mail order for as low as $499.  It is not MS-DOS
  compatible at all.  In fact it's not compatible with anything in the known
  universe.

(Larry L) [ha ha]

(Sysop Tony) It's being replaced with an MS-DOS laptop in August.  The pros
  and cons of the machine have been under almost constant discussion on the
  message board for over a month.  Phil has archived 4 files of commentary
  on the machine in DL11 ... See the file M600??.THD.  I have one for
  support purposes supplied by Tandy.  I'd never own one.

(Larry L) I guess it's doomed to the computer  orphanage.  I see a lot of
  manufacturers of medical equipment [my field] are useing the M100 as  a
  dedicated computer in portable devices.

(Sysop Denny) Hi rowlfe!!!!

(STANTON BARROWS) I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THANKS FOR THIS SIG. I COULD...

(R Caley) [Both Tony and Denny here? A coven of mavens?]

(STANTON BARROWS) NEVER FIND ANY PROGS FOR MY 100 UNTIL I JOINED

(Sysop Denny) [coven=3 or more]

(joshua) [coven -> pagan?]

(Sysop Tony) Is that it, Stanton?

(STANTON BARROWS) I GUESS SO

(Sysop Tony) OK... thanks for the compliment.

(R Caley) I had a comment re: the 600, but I'm sure  it's covered in
  Phil's 4 archived files RS selling orphan 2000's also at $600..

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I noticed that in the flyer I received this week.  In the
  "Where is, as is" section.

(R Caley) M-100's are at a premium  I bought and sold 3 last week
  and there's an RS guy here looking for 100 of them  Is it a cult thing?

(Sysop Tony) I know!  There seems to be a brisk market in used 100's.  Folks
  are finding a used 100 is better than a new 102. 

(rowlfe) just thought I'd drop in again after a long time gone....

(R Caley) [rowlfe, I'm from Seattle too]

(rowlfe) and get back into  the swing of things. ...

(Sysop Tony) (Well swap phone numbers)

(rowlfe) finally got the budget worked out well enough to start up here  again
  on a more regular interval.

(Sysop Tony) Well, I put in for a CompuServe node in Bremerton for you;  told
  them there were a lot of Navy tech's in the area...

(R Caley) [ALRIGHT!]

(Sysop Tony) but it didn't make a dent in the corporate planning.

(R Caley) [RATS!]

(Sysop Tony) But it's on the list. So welcome back.... Eiji told me about
  your box of paper on the floor trick.  (heh heh)  Good show!

(rowlfe) box of paper on the floor>>> say what?

(Sysop Tony) Eiji told me a story  about your attempting to set up your
  computer to capture  messages while you were out to sea.  and CompuServe
  dropped you off line, and the printer spewed out a whole box of paper?
  Maybe just a good story?

(rowlfe) oh, THAT!!!  wasn't quite a whole box, but it was quite a bit. after
  I got the bugs out, regarding time without carrier, that didn't happen
  again, but it sure was a surprise to see it when I got back that time!

(Sysop Tony) I'll bet!  Well  let's see what sort of question Joshua has.  ga
  Joshua ga

(joshua) Good tale! Has RS fixed the 102 bus to allow 3rd party stuff like
  memory banks?

(Sysop Tony) That was the latest report.  And according to some other info
  trickling in PCSG has the Chipmunk working with the new buss
  and is ready to ship.  If they get any orders. (grin)

(joshua) I was thinking of getting a 102 and having  my Chipmunk switched to
  work with it.

(Sysop Tony) Looks like it's now possible.

(rowlfe)  seems to me I have seen a number of ads for Node Systems in CA
  which have large ram banks for the 102 and I was envious of the prices I
  saw, but what is this about a bug in the 102?

(Sysop Tony) The 102  used the same ROM code as the 100  Thus, has all the
  100's bugs.  But in the new hardware they also buffered the system buss,...

(Sysop Denny) [no date bug though]

(Sysop Tony) which made all external peripherals for the 100  usel)Kss.
  (That's what is claimed, Denny - no proof yet) They have apparently just
  changed the buss back, so 3rd party  products will work with it.  By the
  way There are several new RAM expansion products available for the 100/102
  PCSG has a 256K unit that gives you 8 "banks" which can be used the same as
  the original bank. Node Computers has a 256K bank that can be used as one
  continuous bank, to store large files, much as you would on a disk. See the
  file NODE.REV in DL13.  And PG Designs is advertising one called the
  "Vault"... as in "Storage Vault".  See VAULT.THD in DL13.  Traveling
  Software has just announced one that can hold up to 2 megabytes of RAM,
  and several ROM's.  See the file BOOSTR.PRD in DL13.

(Sysop Denny) ok, for joshua:  The different cable you will need should be
  pretty inexpensive I got an extra adaptor board for $25.
  Now for the T102 date bug, I have been running a 102 for 6 months now and it
  still hasn't changed date and I have been online almost every day with it
  Seems they went with the larger hammer theory and eliminated the code
  that changes the year  so, in January, you'll have to change the year
  yourself!

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's what has been reported.  However, there doesn't
  appear that much difference in the ROM checksums to account for deletion of
  some of the original code.  May be, but it seems like there would be a
  greater difference.

(rowlfe) Denny, seems to me the rs-232 port...

(Sysop Denny) Only two bytes would have to be changed.

(rowlfe) was causing the date bug with an interrupt collision, have you been
  using your 102 that way? I have only experienced the date bug  with my 100's
  when I use them to xfer files to and from each other and my bigger machines
  with the rs-232 port.

(Sysop Denny) No, haven't had the problem in any mode, have used all of them.

(rowlfe) ok, just wondering.

(Sysop Tony) I'm still skeptical... we'll see.

(Sysop Denny) No honest, Tony!

(joshua) The difficulty in switching my chipmunk is that  it is set up for my
  T200, so the internal rom would have to be changed, also.

(Sysop Tony) Yep.. that's true.  Even the 100 version may need a different ROM
  than the 102 version there's no telling.  PCSG is very reluctant to release
  any information except selling price.
  I understand even Larry Holmes  who developed the Chipmunk, doesn't have a
  copy of the source code of the DOS!

(Sysop Denny) True on source code  If everything goes the way they (Holmes)
  say,  it should be possible to use the T200 cable and just change the
  ROM But, who knows if it'll work that way

(Sysop Tony)  Well  What was that report on the board that even the pin
  connections  in the buss connecter were changed?  Was that so the 200
  connector could be used, or because of the buss differen}ices, or what?

(Sysop Denny) The pin connections ar}= supposed to be changed  so that is
  exactly like the T200 That was the report from Holmes.

(Sysop Tony) OK  Any more Chipmunk discussion, folks???  I
  would have liked to see them release the version  that was discussed early
  on, which had both the 100 and 200 ROM's internal, with a switch on the back
  panel to allow you to select which machine it would connect to.  That way
  us multi-machine folks, could move the disk drive around to suit the need. 
  Unfortunately  it never happened.  As the two-drive system never happened.

(Gary D.) With this new graphics system on CIS, is RLE dead? and, if so, is
  anybody working on letting us poor ol' 100 users access this new system?

(Sysop Tony) No, the RLE system is not dead.  The new GIF system (pronounced
  "Jif") is color CRT based, and will not likely be available to us LCD users
  due to the screen differences, and the extensive code required to deal with the color screen display.  No one is
  working on a conversion because it's not practical. (As far as I know!)

(Gary D.) OK  Just wondered 'cause I have been having a lot of fun downloading
  and then printing RLE stuff. Have noticed that most uploads recently in
  other forums have been GIF and hardly anything in RLE.

(Sysop Tony) Well, it's the new toy on the block.  But I understand almost 75%
  of the data file deals with color usage.  and we just don't have the RAM to
  handle it.

(rowlfe) C roms

(Sysop Tony) "C's" take precedence over "Q's".  ga Rowlfe

(rowlfe) ok  back to the munk  seems to me a rom change with a switch would be
  QUITE easy to put in provided the roms are pin compatible. bring out the CS
  line and piggy back the roms.  I have done that in another computer I have..
  remember the old ZX-80?  It is now switched from the old 4k rom up to the
  8k rom exactly that way.  its very easy to do.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, the ROM's are plug compatible.  The scheme was to piggyback
  the two ROM's  and bring out a select line to a switch. Then too the 200
  would require a different header.  but they had so much trouble with the 200
  version, the project had a very low priority.

(Sysop Denny) The problem with the 2 roms is space.  It's as tight as I've
  ever seen inside there.

(Sysop Tony) Which version of the Chipmunk do you have?

(rowlfe) (Aha!)

(Sysop Denny) The TEAC variety.

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm  The TEAC one is the one that Larry Holmes said could
  accomodate the 2-ROM scheme. Comment Rowlfe?

(Sysop Denny) [packaging maven?]

(rowlfe) Hmmmm

(Sysop Tony) I'll have to look.  I was inside the Chinon several times  but
  never inside the TEAC.  Remember I added an LED to the Chinnon?

(joshua) Tight fit, wasn't it? <grin>

(Sysop Denny) Yes, I remember that.

(Sysop Tony) Actually, no.... there was lots of room for adding an LED.  There
  is a file on the conversion in DL9 CHIPMK.MOD, I believe.  Larry didn't
  recommend the conversion but didn't object to it, either.  They added the
  LED to the TEAC version. Any more Chipmunk stuff?

(joshua) [where did you put your legs, though?]

(Sysop Denny) Unrelated C -> rowlfe

(Sysop Tony) Legs?  What Legs?  We din' need no stinking legs, man.  What
  legs?  ga Joshua ga

(joshua) Bad joke. sorry,

(rowlfe) (I use cut off BIC Biro pens with rubber erasers.)

(Sysop Tony) Did I miss something????

(Sysop Denny) [time warp]

(Sysop Tony) Interesting.  Speaking of time warps  we need a good program to
  create a record list or a database file for record titles, etc.  How many of
  you are into CD's now?

(rowlfe) (I am! Wotta difference!)

(Sysop Tony) Right!  What a difference!  Closest thing to live sound there is.
   We recently did a sound setup in the Reno convention center for a Wayne
  Newton concert...

(Sysop Denny) You oughta go to the CEForum and say that!

(Sysop Tony) and used a Wayne Newton CD to preset the equipment.  It was
  remarkable. .... People kept sneaking in to see Wayne Newton rehersing, and
  he wasn't even there!  (grin) CEF??? what's that forum for?

(Sysop Denny) That's where all the HiFi nuts are  If you said CD's sound close
  to live,  you'll get a 200 message discussion going.  Lot's of opinions
  there!

(Sysop Tony) Interesting. They aren't listed in FIND under Audio, Sound or
  Music.  I did a tour yesterday.  Did find ROCKNET  They have a CO EVERY
  NIGHT!!! 

(Sysop Denny) It's part of the same area as Rocknet.  GO CEFORUM

(Sysop Tony) But ROCKNET is very focused on the Rock music groups.

(rowlfe) CEForum is Consumer Electronics Forum)

(Sysop Denny) Message base turns over in 2-3 days.

(Sysop Tony) Oh, yes.... now I remember them.  VCR's, Dishes, and all that!

(Sysop Denny) [Alot on audio, though]

(Sysop Tony) Rowlfe, Sad thing to report  I find I'm now spending absolutely
  NO time on my NorthStar, and 90% of my time telecommunicating - and virtually
  no time developing new programs and such.  I've degenerated into a question
  and answer man.  (Bah, Humbug!)

(rowlfe) ah  it's lonely at the top you sa{_y?  I know the }8eeling  however, I
  now spend more time on the N* and less on telecommunicating, ...

(Sysop Tony) (grin)

(rowlfe) due mainly to the budget constraints.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, I hear you on that.  Well, if you can't afford it, you
  can't.  That's the bottom line. 

({_rowlfe) One thing that is really going to put the hurts ...

(Sysop Tony) (We appreciate seeing you, of course.)

(rowlfe) to everyone is the new AT&T surcharge under consideration.

(Sysop Tony) If it goes through. - and the pessimist in me says it probably
  will.  The government n~rever seems to be able to do anything right.  "If it's
  working fine, fix it so it doesn't.... that'll create hundreds of jobs for
  folks trying to fix it again."  Anyone have anything special they want to
  discuss today?

(rowlfe) Denny, you had an unrelated C earlier, remember what it was?

(Sysop Denny) Ah! yes.  It was about your favorite subject, batteries.
  I was able to obtain an offical Yuasa charger from Japan.  Really cute, but
  it buzzes like crazy.

(Sysop Tony) (Bad transformer laminations)

(Sysop Denny) As I have found out, there are a bunch of chargers available for
  lead-acid batteries, ...

(rowlfe) (yup. agree. reglue em together.)

(Sysop Denny) about the size of a M100 supply.  Nope, change to a high quality
   120 volt tranformer  (it was 100) and still buzzes. It comes from the PC
  board. very strange.

(rowlfe) from the BOARD??? wow

(Sysop Tony) (Something's vibrating, then)

(rowlfe) makes me wonder what they did in there.  As Tony just commented,
  something has to be magnetic or something to do that.

(Sysop Denny) There are some unfamiliar components in there that might be
  the cause. ga ynoT.

(Sysop Tony) Try some cold shot on the individual components, as each one is
  cooled down, the source of the problem should change pitch.

(Sysop Denny) Well, it happens under load, noload=no buzz.

(rowlfe) Sure, larger current, more field to shake things up.

(Sysop Denny) But the ones available here should be a lot better. I was
  wondering if you saw one of these chargers in your visit to the East.

(rowlfe) Yep, sure did  and even got a look inside of a few  Most aren't
  regulated very well and some were uven uncontrolled chargers where they
  wound the transformer to get the right voltage out when rectified  However,
  the best one I saw was very simple to build from a LM317 regulator and an SCR
  initially the 317 is in current regulate mode, and then at the trigger
  voltage switched the 317 to voltage regulate mode to maintain the charge,
  and not OVER charge the cell.  I saw a curcuit in a magazine last month
  which does the same thing.  Total cost is about $5 plus the transformer and
  most of the components aren't critical.

(Sysop Tony) That's interesting. Can you send me the schematic, or magazine
  info?

(rowlfe) I'll find it and do just that.  I don't have it here.  The magazine
  is at work along with several others.  Look for more info during the week.

(Sysop Denny) Yeah, but then when you try to package it, the price goes way
  up. I did that with the Yuasa charger module which only costs 6
  bucks }iand all you need is that and an xformer.  But it wound up costing m>i
  30-40 after the box and AC cable, connectors, etc.

(rowlfe) Well, most mf the physical stuff comes out of my junque box

(Sysop Tony) And he built it NEAT, and CLEAN.  That always costs more.
+cker!)

(rowlfe) I do a lot of recycling of parts and such.

(Sysop Denny) Well, I wish I had a supply like that!

(Sysop Tony) Oh, good!  Everybody send Denny your used parts!!!

(rowlfe) (only fills two steamer trunks!  I know! I moved them here!)

(Sysop Denny) NO! new parts! I don't like blowing dust off of everything.

(Sysop Tony) Gad! What a parts box!

(rowlfe) (estimated weight=several hunderd pounds.)

(Sysop Denny) (Hi Phil, smash any fingers?)

(rowlfe) (it is UNUSUAL for me to have to buy ANYTHING anymore!)  Q:
  ok  Phil, or Denny, which of you had the port monitoring program  that I saw
  at one of the meetings in LA?  I seem to}i have lost it and I could really use
  it right now.

(Sysop Tony) Peter St. Clair developed that.  It's in DL7.  Called INPORT.100.

(rowlfe) oops! sorry bout that!

(Sysop Tony) I just happened to be looking at it yesterday.  What do you
  need it for?

(rowlfe) I plan on adding an A/D converter for digitizing pictures using}i the
  FP-215 plotter I have.

(Syso{_p Tony) Source?  TV camera?  RLE type stuff?

(rowlfe) None of the a{)ove... using a simple photo transistor to get a level at
 ~r discrete points on the picture.  I thought about just monitoring the signal,
  converting it to digital and then sampling a port somehow.  I finally got
  the plotter up and running after frying the pen lift coil a few months
  (years?) back,  and now I want to use it for something other than what it
  was intended and I need to do some hardware things to get this all to work.
  By u~rsing the port program, I can set the right A/D range auto matically,
  based on an initial quick scan of the picture, then go back and do it for
  real.  I don't want to have to set the range of the A/D by hand. clear?

(Sysop Tony) James Yi did an interesting file on using the barcode and printer
  ports for data input.  You might find something useful there.  See PORTS.USE
  in DL8.

(Sysop Denny) Are you using the {_plotter to mount the sensor? And then do a
  scan of the picture underneath?

(rowlfe) Exactly.

(~2jysop Tony) Huh! Just us engineering types here now...

(Sysop Denny) Ooooh neet!

(rowlfe) The plotter can do some neat things, I just want it to do more!

(Sysop Denny) That would be a first, a digitizer for an M100. ...

(Phil W) [Hi -- Lurking while working!]

(Sysop Denny) Do you stick to the 64X240 matrix?

(rowlfe) Well, actually, the original thought was to make a  picture the same
  way the old TTY's did a long while back scan the picture, then print a
  character with the same gray density based on what was seen by the detector
  end.  With the M100, I am not sure how to go about using the display, but
  I'll think on it and see wha}it I can come up with.  This is all still in the
  "thinking" stage right now, since I just started playing with an A/D chip I
  got by accident a while back.

(Sysop Denny) Well, there has been some new info  brought forth about the LCD,
   Tony, do you remember the filename of James file?

(Sysop Tony) Looking. ...

(rowlfe) If i knew how an RLE file was stored, I might be able to make those
  work. ...

(Sysop Denny) Also, Phil was working on a conversion formula just this last
  couple of weeks.

(rowlfe) come to think of it.  AHA! another thought just occurred to me  this
  has more potential than I thought!!!! A text {_reader!

(Sysop Tony) Can't spot it right off...  It was LCD-something.

(Sysop Denny) I think it was LCDIO or something in DL8.  OCR for the M100?

(Sysop Tony) That's what I thought... and I was looking in the DL1 DES file.
   Can't seem to find it.

(Phil W) [I was? -- Cris Agnew -- LDCIO.TXT]

(Sysop Tony) There is a file documenting the RLE f}?rmat, somewhere.  (There
  you go.)

(rowlfe) is that LCDIO or LDCIO?

(Sysop Tony) By Dr. Preble, I think... HOWTO.RLE????  LCDIO... Phil fangles
  his tingers otf}ien.

(Sysop Denny) LCDIO.TXT in DL8.   oops  [spoelling checker :)]

(matthew) here i am...what's a good xmodem type prog?

(Sysop Tony) Matthew, that's a little like asking, "What's a good car?" 
  Depends on what you want to do with it, What computer you want to use it in
  Whether you need it to communicate with odd BBS's etc.

(matthew) Dnload to floppy

(Sysop Tony) Which Floppy?

(matthew) tdd  tandy portable

(Sysop Tony) Sorry, you can't download to the TDD.

(matthew) dang it! no way at all?

(Sysop Tony) There is only one communication chip in the computer  and when it
  is being used to communicate via the modem,  it cannot also access the
  RS-232 port where the TDD is plugged in. 

(matthew) suggestions? i keep running out of ram when i dload

(Sysop Tony) there is, however, a couple of ways around the problem
  If, for example, you use an external modem, then you can use a switch,
  to switch between modem and disk drive.  You download something into RAM,
  then save it to disk, kill the file, then download som-& more.  It's
  cumbersome, but it works.  there is also a "quirky" way of doing it if you
  use Disk Power DOS and acoustic cups.  But all in all  it's not worth the
  effort.  Suggest you read the 3 files in DL3 called DSKTRM.???.

(matthew) thanks for the info.

(rowlfe) (XMODEM.312 can go to cassette, I think. would that help?)

(matthew) I was hoping that it'd be straight-forward. i had one called ...

(Sysop Tony) Yes, all the Xmodem programs can save to cassette.

(matthew) sxm, but it was weird. i think i'll go for xmodem 312. thanks all

(Sysop Tony) Actually, the only two disk drives  that can be used for direct
  download to disk, are the DVI and the Chipmunk, because they are buss
  connected.  That's one of the neat things they don't tell you up front, huh?

(Sysop Denny) SXM is very similar to XMODEM.312  what was it that you didn't
  like? It might be in .312 also.

(matthew) the sxm i had put a <CR> after EACH character!

(Sysop Denny) !!!!!

(matthew) uh huh

(Sysop Denny) That's a bug!

(Sysop Tony) XMDM26.100 is the latest version.

(rowlfe) ("A" bug? a BIG bug!)

(Sysop Denny) That shouldn't happen with any of the Xmodem programs.

(Sysop Tony) It's got a few new features.  and handles  an external modem,
  when you want to move up to 1200 baud.

(matthew) we made it stop, but then got NO <CR> at all  might add an external

(Sysop Denny) Try one of the 3 mentioned here. They should all work properly.

(Sysop Tony) They're all in DL3.

(matthew) tks. :)

(Sysop Tony) Hey guys!  It's past 11 AM  Well, it looks like we're out of time
  for this morning's conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel
  free to stick around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming}i this
