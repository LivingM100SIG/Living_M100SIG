(Sysop .^Dave^.) Now then let us get on the way here as most folks know, today
  is a special conference TOPIC: Lucid/Super ROM
  with Michael Stanford here from Portable Computer Support Group.
  Michael, do you have opening remarks?
(Michael s) the main opening remark I have is about our $5000.00 contest.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Prime concern of attendees I think, is to get Lucid working
  as reflected in the message sent you by EasyPlex,
  but seems like a big announcement you have.

(Mike A.,PCSG) I'd like to hear more about the contest, but to get things
 started Questionwise, let me pass along to you, Michael, the major question
 I get: How do I do file transfers between Lucid and 1-2-3, etc.
 I know you have lots more experience in that so please elucidate on Disk+.
(Michael s) OK,  there are two main ways to get data from Lucid to 123 and
 others, well three actually:
 1. cut and paste with text
 2. Visicalc format with Disk+
 3. DIF format with Lucid utilities
 the first is the simplest, but looses information about formulas, transferring
 only the information that actually shows on the screen.
 the second is the simplest and most effective, the latest version of Disk+
 transfers disk+ format files to DOS format at the touch of a key, and it
 automatically recognises a Lucid file and translates it to Visicalc format
 which all spreadsheets can read.

(Mike A.,PCSG) If I could pass along a followup, Bill Templeton of the Danville
 Tigers wanted me to ask whether we'll offer capability to do analytical
 graphics. 
(Michael s) The answer is not in the forseeable future.  We don't have anyone
 working on it right now mainly because this is the first request we have had
 for it. We used to market a program called Graph+, but Tandy bought it and we
 can't sell it ourselves any more.  It does pie, bar and line graphs.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) can you address some of the questions raised by Al Goldman?
(Michael s) Dave, I did get two of the communications from Al Goldman, but was
 locked out of email before i was able to get the entire 9K of questions.
 His main concern seemed to be with the clarity of the manual concerning the
 report templates in lucid data. The manual for Lucid data I agree is not the
 model of clarity that the other parts of the SuperRom manual are. this is
 because they were written by someone else...  namely me.
 We are kicking around  the idea of a Super ROM newsletter, also let me refer
 you to a series of 6 articles on Lucid DATA currently running in Portable 100,
 where the author goes into great detail on this very subject.
 also the purpose of the contest is to gather a collection of good examples of
 Lucid Data applicatgions, since examples are probably the best way to teach
 anything computer related.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't tell me you didn't get the 9K file? And didn't scream
  for help!!

(Sysop .^Dave^.) I'm sure the members here will find the Portable 100 articles
  interesting if the publisher ever distributes them.
  In the mean time, let us see what questions folks have to clarify matters in
  the meantime.


(Rob D) As Mike knows, my and a few others main problem is the report specifier
 blocks.  I'm putting together some applications for our staff but the fact
 that the blocks move when deleting records (rows) bombs the applications.
 Any suggestions?
(Michael s) If you frequently delete the first few rows, of your spreadsheets,
 and when deleting lines go down subsequently and insert rows again above the
 block.
 Alternatively, never actually remove rows by deleting them, simply blank out
 that record with the spacebar, and periodically use sort to dump the blank
 records to the bottom of the spreadsheet.
(Rob D) Hmmm.  I've tried that myself, but for users who do not have a lot of
 expertise which such things, these...
 hands and not use it.  I think the SUPER ROM is a groundbreaking product but
 this is a weak link in my opinion and I was hoping you might go in the
 direction of protecting some columns out to the right hand side of the...
 Columns DR through DV.
 I don't think that would reduce the capability of the spreadsheet by too much.
(Michael s) good suggestion, but let me share some of the considerations that
 went into the design of the ROM.
 1. Space in the ROM
 2. Time
 3. Generality/specialization.
 the first two points I think don't need explanation.
 Obviously we could have kept squeezing the code more and more, adding more and
 more features and delaying the introduction further and further,
 but the third point is the one that is at issue here. we actually took rows
 251 to 254 and gave them special internal functions, making the spreadsheet
 a little smaller but to put an arbitrary point in the middle of the
 spreadsheet and not let row deletes go past it would be hard to explain
 in the manual and would open us to complaints that the program was getting too
 complicated. Every feature we add has to be explained, and while it makes the
 program more powerful, it also makes more to assimilate for the user.
(Rob D) Yeow! Not in the middle, but the last column. DV. thanks


(Moshe) Will we ever see the following enhancements to Lucid?
 1. The ability to "freeze" first column and or row like 123's Title command?
 2. Ability to enter formulas as in 123 through pointing without the darn
 Cntrol W requirement?
(Michael s) In response to the first point, I agree it would help
 but unfortunately it would have required a completer redesign to the Lucid
 screen module, which we simply didn't have time for.  Sam uses a technique to
 get by this problem, however...
 Simply use the rapid cut and paste facilities of lucid to copy the labels that
 you want to be frozen, then go the the area where you will be working, insert
 a row or column and paste in the labels.
 In response to the second point, we have a difference of design philosophy
 here, as you know Lucid was modeled very closely on 123, but we made some
 changes which we felt were improvements. in particular I can't stand the way
 123 has two modes for entering formulas, first for initial entry where
 pointing works then for editing, when you can't point, but have to figure it
 out before hand. we decided from the start to be both in edit and point mode
 at all times which helps us towards the 'modeless' user interface which is
 the holy grail of user friendly program designers. you can use 'wander'
 whether you are entering a formula for the first time or editing, and you can
 use the edit keys even when entering a formula for the first time.
 123 can't do this. 
(Moshe) OK, But I kindof disagree with the second answer!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Note that Michael
  DID say that there was a differnce in philosophy!


(TIM B.) Thanks.  I agree with Moshe about Title locks. I think it would be
 great to have them Vert, Horz, and both.
 I would be willing to pay for an update if that was necessary...
(Rob D) [ditto]
(Moshe) ditto
(TIM B.) I use Spreadsheets for estimating and that function is worth its
 weight in gold. One of the problems that this would eliminate would be...
 When I set up the Spreadsheet for an estimate I usually put the text at the
 beginning - Say A1 to D1, but when I go to E1 to put the $ in and A1 goes off
 the screen I lose all text and any reference as to where I am in the estimate!
 It would be nice for the text to stay in empty cells even when you scroll.
(Sam R) I would like to comment on this one. I also was frustrated with this
 situation but I found that the technique that Michael mentioned briefly has
 been a godsend for me. We have the capability to achieve virtually the same
 effect as freezing the screen. I simply go to the labels and copy them with
 the simple block and copy method, then when I am in an area that I can't see
 the labels, I paste them into an inserted row or column. When I am finished in
 that area, I just delete that row or column, move to a new area and paste
 again. mIchael has a comment about another techinique that will accomplish
 some of the same objectives.
(Michael s)  The lucid dat forms or views capability was conceived with the end
 in mind of leaving prompts on the screen permanently because you can have
 multiple views in the same view file you can effectively see your 'column
 headings' throughout the spreadsheet. simply make a view template file to show
 the column headings as the prompts.
(TIM B.) I still would like to have the Title locks.
 I understand what you are saying about the paste & copy, but would you
 consider including this function as an update in the future?


(Mike L.) I'm quite interested in the Super Rom, although there's one
 very important feature that I need. Is there any possibility of making
 Super Rom compatible with the D/VI down the road???
(Michael s) In response to Tim's last question, before going on to Mike L's.
 We certainly don't close the door to improvements to Super ROM. It rather
 depends on the market response to the M102, and the demand for software for
 it.
 About the DVI. Which I guess is related, since it, too is the victim of the
 whims of the marketplace. The happy fact is that most M100 users recognised
 that the DVI was not a well conceived product. the idea was great, but the
 implementation is rather unfortunate. If more had been sold there would have
 been sufficient demand to justify the expenditure of effort to make Super ROM
 compatible, but we live under the harsh reality of the bottom line, and the
 cost of development, which would be considerable would never be covered by the
 sales, even if every DVI owner bought two copies!!
(Mike L.) I understand the harsh realities of the business world although
 I disagree about the product being ill-conceived other than from the marketing
 standpoint.  It is extremely user compatible and I thought that maybe this
 ease of compatibility might make it less costly to develop verses all the
 work that must have gone in to getting the TDD to work with Super Rom.
(Michael s) The TDD required virtually no work, since we already had chipmunk
 compatibility.  The big problems with the DVI are the screen and the way it
 writes files. The file structure of the M100 is horribly limited in
 conception, the problem being that the only binary format available is the .CO
 format, which is great as long as you don't want to save or load it.
 The operating system of the model 100 (and the DVI, but not the TDDor the
 Chipmunk) requires that binary files be relocated to an 'execute address'
 before being saved. we get round this with SuperROM by having our own
 internal save command, which goes directly to the cassette port bypassing the
 M100 OS. Incidentally we had to redo the entire save code and put it in our
 own ROM.  If you need more detail on this please write and I'll get our
 customer support people to pen a reply.
(Mike L.) Would it be possible to save by the user typing 0: instead of CAS:??
(Michael s) no.
(Mike L.) OK, thanks for the info, that's all I needed.


(Rob D) Two c's actually, A) On title locking...
 I agree with Michael that input screens are the way to go.
 1) create titles in TEXT separated by commas,
 2) copy and paste to LUCID,
 3) search and replace TEXT file with :[#  ]<CR>.
 This creates a quick input screen ON space in the ROM which is limited.
 I would hope that any future update of SUPER would include integrated print
 routines for all applications including pixel plotting.  Thanks
(Michael s) Great idea Rob. this is the kind of stuff we are hoping our
 $5000.00 contest will bring forth.  We feel that the integration of all the
 modules by cut and paste is one of the nicest features of Super.
 About the print routines,  this is a good idea too, and one that would
 certainly have been done if we had rewritten Lucid and Write ROM from scratch
 for Super.  It may well be implemented as a space saver if we ever decide to
 issue another update to Super.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Rob <= Drive the Freeway to Dallas and pound on Michael!

  Er, Michael's desk!


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Michael ...
  NOW is the time to make your special announcement about the contest.
go man, go!
(Sam R) I will comment. About the contest. We are really excited about this
 one. $2500 first prize, $5000 in total prizes, 18 winners in all.
 This whole idea is to illustrate to people who don't know some of the
 phenomenal things that you can do with Super ROM. WE HAVE A list of ideas
 for those who don't know what to submit, but it is really interesting to
 hear uses that people have come up with. we will be looking at lots of
 differect executions of examples so get yours in because if its clever or
 merely practical it might win something. we are going to make available all of
 the differect submissiions so that everyone will seee how others are
 performing interesting things.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Last shot at Lucidity folks!
(Dave Sp) Contest question. Are you looking for applicatins only?
(Michael s) We are looking for any kind of usage or clever execution.
 For example in Write ROM you can answer form prompts with Library codes and
 create very clever things that way.
(Dave Sp) That's great for non-tech folks like myself!!
(Moshe Shurin) will the submissions to contest be available on compuserve for
 downloading?
(Michael s) Yes.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well that takes care of THIS conference.
  Thanks to all for attending
  and thanks for guesting there Sam/Michael.
End of Conference.
Period.
