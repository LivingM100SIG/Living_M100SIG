  Title   : Thread on converting BACKRD.100 to .200
  Keywords: NODE BACKUP PC RAMDISK COPY TRANSFER XFER 200 M100CO DISK

  This file contains a captured message thread describing changing
  BACKRD.100 (a program for the 100/102), so it will run in a 200, allowing
  the user to backup all files in a 256K Node RAMdisk to a PC clone, using
  M100CO.EXE in the PC to simulate a TDD (Tandy Portable Disk Drive). It
  results in a fast, automatic way to backup all Node files to a PC,
  requiring only minutes to copy all files to a PC disk.

  long as you need only pass parameters to the A and HL registers.  Sometimes
  more is needed, however.  This is a technical discussion of some alternate
  ways to do this -- short of writing a machine language program!!

  users modify their computers for use with internal NiCad batteries, while
  others swear by external battery packs (such as the Yausa Gel Cells).

  code. It performs a checksum of any file in either an ASCII mode or BINARY.
  Various run time options are available, and the code supports the MS-DOS
  pathspec. It requires DOS 2.0 or later and 64K bytes to execute.   This
  version corrects 3 minor bugs in the original.  See source file for
  details. Extract with an un-archiver such as ARCE or PKUNPAK.

  longer than 255 characters (uses LINEINPUT).  Program  prompts for the
  number of consecutive blank lines to keep (no more than 9). This is a new
  version which corrects a bug and shortens  the program.

  The Model 100 and its relatives are probably the best computers there
  are for on-the-go communications.  An earlier THD file (GERMAN.THD, DL3)
  details communications in Germany -- and WLINK1.THD (DL13) discusses
  overseas communication for one specific modem.  This file captures recent
  messages related to overseas communications with the CSC network.

  start. Also requires a program like RFU.100 in DL4 to get the start address
  of the tokenized file in M100 RAM. The resulting detokenized data is stored
  in OUTPUT.DO and must be loaded into M100 BASIC to recover the original
  program.

  are in decimal, but output is in hex.  Changes from original are cosmetic.

  DMPTDD.BA is a short program which lets you dump a specified range of
  disk sectors to a RAM file named "DMPOUT.DO", with POWR-DOS.  The output is
  the ASCII representation, and is text for DO files on the disk and
  "garbage" otherwise.  I wrote it for exploratory purposes, but it can be
  used for quick- and-dirty text file recovery (is NOT a replacement for
  RECOVR.BA!).

  Chipmunk (and DVI) disk drives are able to provide this capability.
  Unfortunately, the Tandy Portable Disk Drives (TDD & TDD2) suffer in this
  regard, due to their use of the RS-232 for interfacing with the computer.
  This file captures typical messages on this subject.

  ENCODE.MMM is an enhanced file security program which allows
  discrete coding and decoding of text files by use of user selected dual
  two-digit numerical master codes; i.e. [5,25],[31,96],etc. The encoded text
  masks both format and letter frequency. Use of Model 100 graphics
  precludes printing of encoded text, thus enhancing file security. Encoded
  text can be transmited to other computers using an 8-bit protocol
  (i.e.,M8N1E, 78E1D, etc)

  The Epson P-80 printer is a small printer which would seem ideally suited

  some answers...not lots of information, but a start.  The fact that this is
  a serial printer makes its use with the 100/102/200 not too promising!

  "invisible" entry will NOT display on the main MENU, although it can be

  "I"   - Make entry invisible
  "V"   - Make entry visible
  SPACE - No change to entry
  ENTER - No change to entry

  Users of the Model 100/102/200 often find it desirable to make certain
  files invisible.  Some make SCHEDL and ADDRSS invisible to clean up the
  menu. Other programs are made invisible to avoid inadverently killing of
  them. And in other cases security is a factor.  These messages discuss some
  of the pitfalls and cautions to be considered in using programs such as
  INVISI.100 to make files disappear from the menu.

  This program is derived from Phil Wheeler's LFUTL.PW1, and Hugo
  Ferreyra's FIXLF.HF1, which installs a hidden printer linefeed patch in the
  printer output path, which will send a linefeed to the printer every time a
  cariage return is sent. This program is designed to be a resident,
  invisible utility, which will toggle the function by typing LF at the main
  menu, and pressing the ENTER key. CMD.100 required to make it invisible.

  program will print the disk based DIRLST files produced by LOGPDD.BA. If
  you have PowrDOS these are really useful progs. Using the disk based files
  the programs handle double the amount of data as the original program.

  100. It is supported in this Forum in DL 12.  Of late, there has been
  little NEC action here.  These messages note that fact -- and contain info
  regarding the NEC upgrade, the NEC 8300.  This is the first THD file on the
  NEC -- indicating the relative lack of activity (t'was not always so, as
  evidenced by the number of NEC-peculiar programs in DL 12.

  POWR-DOS is a TDD1 OS which works with the TDD2 in all but its
  sector access mode (which is a built-in FLOPPY2 feature, anyway).  But
  Powr-Dos cannot be booted from the TDD2.  This file tells how to make it
  feasible to load Powr-Dos from the TDD2.  An added feature is that you do
  not need to use your Powr-Dos distribution disk again -- once you have
  followed the steps here.  And the same approach will work for back-up
  purposes with the TDD1.

  PSWRD.RAD is a short BASIC program designed to provide a degree of file
  protection for the 100/102 portables. Tampering creates a .DO file (UNUSER)
  that logs the time & date and then shuts off your computer. The password is
  "go"(lower case),but you can enter your own in line 40. You must IPL the
  program to run it correctly and it will not interfere with any programs in
  RAM. SHIFT-BREAK or ^C interrupts the program so security is not 100%.

  This program resequences BASIC programs. To use RESEQ, save the program to
  be renumbered as a .DO file. When run, RESEQ will show all files in
  the directory and ask for "file?". Type in the file name complete with
  DO extention. It will then ask for "1st #" and "Inc". Enter the first
  number and increment desired. Upon completion, RESEQ will beep. The
  resequenced file can then be reloaded into BASIC. -Ray Yeargin

  The Model 100 et al use a Molex socket for expansion ROM's.  But most
  ROM's come with a more conventional dual in-line pin configuration.
  Vendors (e.g., Traveling Software and PCSG) have employed several
  approaches to adapting ROM chips to the Model 100 family.  Hmmmm... One
  wonders why Tandy did not give us a "normal" socket in the first place!
  Anyway -- these messages discuss how do-it-yourself EPROM makers can get

  This program is intended to facilitate sorting, selectivly deleting,
  and deleting prior to a given date - your NOTE.DO file. The NOTE.DO file
  must be in the form ' MM/DD/YY, NOTE '.
  Keep in mind that the entire NOTE.DO file is brought into working
  storage, so in effect you will need room for an additional copy of the file
  in memory, so use 'DELETE OLD RECORDS' often. Suggestions are welcome!

  There are still a few folks frequenting the Model 100 who were here in
  the early days, four years ago -- and some remember when there were less
  than 1000 messages on the board (in June of 1983) and very few files in the
  DL's These messages have reminiscences from some of the early users.
  FAME.THD is a related thread, with informal (unsolicited) votes for a SIG
  Hall of Fame.

  This is a loose collection of messages (vs. a collection of loose
  messages!) on the general topic of the TDD2 (and even the TDD).  Issues
  addressed include software (operating system) available for the TDD2,
  machine language conflicts, and some inconclusive problem discussions.  If
  they become conclusive, I'll add that to this THD.

  Have you ever had a TDD disk become unreadable?  Well there is hope.
  The data is probably still there, waiting to be read, IF you can get to
  it. There appears to be a bug in the TDD's built-in ROM that trashes
  the directory -- but not the data.  To date there are no free recovery
  programs; but there are some very effective commercial ones.  Read this

  Program prompts for time your Model 100 should do something... then
  asks what that something should be. Current time and alarm time are
  reported on the screen, as well as the action to be taken, which must be
  a BASIC program. If you have a music program, you've got a very
  expensive alarm clock!  PA= 272

  This is another version of TIMER.DO that will convert itself when first
  run. Save this file as TIMER.DO, and from BASIC enter the command
  RUN"TIMER.DO". The program will convert encoded graphics into standard

  SAVE"TIMER" and KILL"TIMER.DO", and you'll be ready to start timing.

    Transfering files between the 100/102/200 and other computers  can be
  FAST and painless!  For my 77 year old mother I put together this
  little 1.5k explanation for her to use with her and my brother's Tandy
  102s.  If she  can do it, anyone can.
  
       This is transfering files made simple!

     -trapper- is a game based on the light cycle sequence in the movie
  "Tron". You must move around the screen without hitting a screen border or
  wall. You win if your enemy hits a wall. To move up you hit <ESCAPE>, down
  is <TAB>, left is the equal sign ("="), and right is the <DEL> key.
      Good luck!

  The Model 100 family is based on ROM-ware, permiting basic
  operations without loading software. But ROM routines can be limiting. The
  designers of the firmware provided "hooks" into the ROM routines, so
  programmers can jump out of the ROM program into their own routines, and
  back again. The overwrite programs for the M100/102 and 200 owe their
  existence to use of these hooks. These messages discuss how it works --

  UTLPW2.100 is  created from UTILTY.100. The Cload and Csave functions have
  been deleted. New functions are Filn and Prnt, implemented by embedding
  FILEN.100 & PRINT.100 in the program. Note that Prnt is configured for
  Epson printers and uses emphasized print (change line 77), with form-feed
  at end of file. The advantage of this is storing multiple utilities under
  one menu entry. Of course, you can add to, delete or change the utilities
  included

  The question of translating a text file from one word processor (WP) to

  for example, Multimate creates non-ASCII files.  Other WP's (e.g., Wordstar

  these issues, focusing on Wordstar conversion and the Model

  X-TEL is a commercial program for the Model 100/102 (and 200) with
  some really neat capabilities.  It supports XMODEM transfers at machine
  language speeds -- fast!  And it does so for binary (CO & BA) files.
  Finally, the latest version provides capture of ASCII files (like Forum

  Using XMDPW5.200 to create XMDPW5.CO in the Tandy 200 will take
  special measures -- compared to the 100 version, where you can simply
  "Load" the DO file to create the BA loader, and then run the BA file to
  create the CO program.  Since the total size of the DO file (XMDPW5.200)
  and resulting BA loader exceeds the memory capacity of the 200, this
  approach will not work.  There is now a "James Yi Special" approach!

   Very useful AltLCD utility.  You name a file and a search
  string. ZIPFYI.CO finds all the records containing your string and appends
  them to a file called MATCH.DO -- quickly.
   This file is the listing for a BASIC program that creates ZIPFYI.CO.
   You probably won't need the .DOC file for this one unless you want info on
  calling ZIPFYI from a BASIC program.

  There are a number of reasons for wanting to control the LCD in a
  special way from within machine language programs.  One is to increase the
  effective transfer speed by inhibiting screen scroll (as discussed here,
  and implemented in Basic programs such as Denny's X/Q-Hayes series).
  Another would be to create special terminal features (e.g., a split
  screen capability for use during COnferences here).  These messages discuss
  M/L code for LCD control.
