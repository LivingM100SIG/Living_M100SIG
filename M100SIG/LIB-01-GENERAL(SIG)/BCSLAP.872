	Boston Computer Society
	Model 100 Group
	Meeting, 2/28/87, Boston Globe


Bill Gerber opened the meeting at 11:05 a.m..  Terry Kepner was present and 
talked about his magazine PICO.  The first PICO contest is over; a new 
contest is starting with the April issue.  Prize:  a NEC Multi-Speed.  
Anyone who entered the first contest is entered in this one; also anyone who
subscribed.  Anyone can enter, no purchase necessary:  send a postcard with 
name, address and what computer you own.
	Annual subscription:  $29.97.  Anyone who subscribes also gets a 
coupon to sign up for the Source without the $50 start-up fee.  (There is a 
$10/month minimum on the Source.)
	Portable Computing International
	P.O. Box 481
	Peterborough, NH 03458-0481.

	Scott Anderson (affiliated with Traveling Software) announced a new 
product.  Inspired by LAPDOS, the system to connect a laptop disk drive to 
the IBM PC, he developed MACDOS, a system to connect the Tandy Portable Disk
Drive to the Macintosh.  You plug your disk drive into the Mac.  Will ship 
March 17, 1987.  Does not require setting the dip switches.  (The drive 
contains enough intelligence that it can send data to any computer that 
knows how to talk to it.  The dip-switch to load the operating system into 
your Model 100 sets the drive to transmit that operating system and is only 
needed for that purpose.)
	MACDOS has an editor and a menu for transmitting files; it can copy 
all types of files (.CO included) and can edit .DO files.  (It is not 
integrated into the Finder.)  
	Suggested retail:  $95.

	John Cahill spoke about the new Tandy Portable Disk Drive 2, 
recently announced and soon to be available.  This will hold 200K per disk (
twice as much as the old one) and will sell for $199.  There is no upgrade 
policy; you can't trade-in your old one.  Apparently both drives are made by
Brother.  The new one is double-sided, not single-sided.  Old disks can be 
read by the new drive.  Unlike most disk drives, the two sides work like 
separate banks and each file is on one side only.
	Our data library will be available on disks recorded on the old 
drive (if possible) so they will be readable by either drive.  We don't yet 
have the disk drive Tandy promised us; we are hoping that when it arrives it
will be an old-style drive.
	Terry Kepner lent Steve Cremer (the librarian) his Tandy Disk Drive 
until Steve gets the one from Tandy.

	A sort of roll call was taken in which each person gave his/her name
and what he/she was looking for from the group.  Several problems and 
solutions were matched up this way, many of which had to do with printers 
that did too many or too few line feeds.  I don't know how to spell all the 
names so I won't try to list them all, but here are some highlights:
	One member reports that he has no problems because as yet he has no 
hardware.  Still looking for the right computer.
	Terry Kepner mentioned the PICO Bulletin Board:  603-924-9770.  300 
or 1200 baud.  Open to anyone who wants to call in.
	Steve Cremer pointed out that the next meeting will be the  Flea 
Market,  March 28, at the Globe.  Bring your old stuff for sale.  The 
meeting after that, April 28, will be on a Tuesday evening.

	The main even was "Graphics."  Bill Gerber presented several 
programs, and passed out source listings and examples of output.  Big Print,
by Michael J. Himowitz, can print letters of various sizes, mixing with 
normal-sized letters.  Good for signs, etc.
	Banner prints banners sideways on your printer.
	He also presented a pie chart program, a bar chart program, and 
SCDUMP, a screen dump program (that doesn't work because part of it seems to
be missing).

	Jim Franklin talked about several screen-dump programs that are 
available in the public domain.  These are slow and written in Basic, and 
not generally useful because to enter the program you must exit whatever 
program put the stuff on the screen.  They are best viewed as routines to 
put into your own programs to give them screen-dumping capability.

	Mark Lutton talked about COALA and CANVAS, two drawing programs.  
These are really not much more than toys, but are fun to play with in a 
boring meeting.  COALA is fast but can't print or save drawings -- turning 
your machine into a sort of super Etch-a-Sketch.  CANVAS can print or save 
drawings but is very slow and is no threat to MacPaint.

	Al Goldman talked about RLE Graphics -- Run Length Encoded -- as 
implemented on CompuServe.  Weather maps are available, as well as other 
pictures.  He passed out a handout with examples:  U.S. map, halftone 
pictures, a circuit diagram, etc. along with programs to view or print these
pictures.  He printed them out on his Diconix portable printer and on an 
Epson LX-80.  (Oddly enough, the Epson printout was exactly 1/3 larger than 
the Diconix printout and Al has no idea why.  The Diconix only prints Elite,
not Pica, but that is a ratio of 5 to 6, not 3 to 4.
	Running the program takes about 7 minutes on the Model 100.  A 
typical encoded picture takes about 5 to 7Kbytes.

	Howard Lasnick mentioned J.D. Hildebrand's new magazine, Laptop 
User, and "Club 100".  Many of us have received mailings about this.  We are
eager to see the magazine (which should start showing up next month) and 
wish the best for Hildebrand.  We also talked about the late (at least in 
the chronological sense), lamented Portable 100 magazine.  Terry Kepner 
consulted Dunn & Bradstreet and found that Portable 100 has NOT filed 
bankruptcy, contrary to rumors.  The publisher still says that the magazine 
is alive and will continue to publish.

	John Cahill talked about the June Picnic.  He is looking for 
suggestions & volunteers.  (He would like someone else (other than him) to 
coordinate it this year.)  Also he talked about the Kyocera Kyotronic 85 he 
bought from a liquidator; it was totally non-compatible with the Model 100 
so he sent it back.  It is OK for text-only use.

	Meeting adjourned at 1:20 p.m., and we went to the Globe's cafeteria
and talked about various subjects (the space shuttle, British TV, political 
jokes, and others to humorous to mention) until the sun went down.
