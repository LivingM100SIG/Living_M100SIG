(Sysop Denny) Hi Tony.

(Sysop Tony) Hello...  All things considered... I'd rather be in bed!

(Sysop Denny) Well, You could move to NY!

(Bill T.(NYC)) ::morning/afternoon all ) Denny, was that a slam on NYC?

(Sysop Denny) No, just that you can get up later on Sunday morn.

(Bill T.(NYC)) true true...lot of rain today though.

(Bill T.(NYC)) I got a M200, and there's a port on the left side, near the
  rear...know what it is?  it's not in the books.

(Sysop Tony) The Bar Code Reader input port.

(Bill T.(NYC)) Did Tandy ever make a M101?

(Sysop Tony) No.

(Bill T.(NYC)) I heard from somebody that said they had one, and I thought
  they might be making a typing error, but I didn't know fer sure.

(Sysop Tony) Most likely a typo.  There was no 101.

(Bill T.(NYC)) I got  another QQQ <<been saving up all week!!>>

(R Caley) [QQQ?]

(Sysop Tony) Well, go ahead, you still have the floor.  (Is that 3 questions,
  Rush?)

(R Caley) no - whats a QQQ?

(Sysop Tony) (That's a desparate Q)

(Bill T.(NYC)) Assembly Language: any recomendations as to literature on how
  to use it,and how to load

(Sysop Tony) Well....  "How to use assembly language" is kind of like
  asking "how to use a car". ....  It's another way to program your computer.
   "How to load" is another matter. .... If you are an assembly programmer,
   then you "load" by assembling the program at the execution address.  If
  you're not, then all assembly language programs specify which, or what,
  loader must be used to load it into the machine.  If it's a BASIC Loader,
  then it's in the form of a BASIC program, which you run, and it loads the
  assembly language program for you.  If it's not, then most likely it's a HEX
  file, in which case there are loaders that convert the hex file  into .CO
  code, and put it on the menu.  It's a whole study in itself.  Suggest you
  read the file ASMBLY.UTL in DL8 to start with.

(Bill T.(NYC)) ok, tnx tony...I gotta start somewhere, and that's a lot more
  info than Ihad before.... tnx agin...out  (no more QQQ)

(GENE NESTRO) I've been having a problem with "Shift/Print"  when using
  somtimes the M100 hangs-up & I must Cold Start it any suggestions?

(Sysop Tony) It's possible that your "hang up"  is caused by the printer.
  SHIFT-PRINT is a ROM dump routine and it may be able to send characters
  faster than your printer can receive them.  In which case, the printer could
  issue a "Stop!" command, and the computer is doing just that.  Shift-print
  is only useful for fast dumps to see what's what or as a record of a file.
  If you want formatted output, then you should use a printing program of some
  sort.  ga Denny ga

(Sysop Denny) ok - I have had what seemed to be a cold start hangup with my
  printer but it's always been the 'online' switch being in the offline state.
   Could it be that your printer is going offline without your knowledge?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's correct  If you SHIFT-PRINT, and the printer's not
  ready to receive you don't get any warning, it just stops, because the
  printer isn't ready.

(GENE NESTRO) It must be the printer because it also happened with the
  Echo thanks much-will check ptinter.

(Sysop Denny) [same problem]

(Sysop Tony) Question is  does it happen after printing has started, and been
  going for a while,  or right after you press SHIFT-PRINT or the function
  key?

(GENE NESTRO) after hitting Sh/Prt

(Sysop Tony) Well, then most likely the printer isn't ready to receive.

(GENE NESTRO) I'll swap my printer w a friend & see if he has the problem

(Sysop Tony) That's not likely to define the problem  but whatever.  Any more
  on this?

(GENE NESTRO) no thankx ... There was some good to it  it caused me to write a
  Cold Start program for the TDD1..Will the program work w/the TDD2? I use
  Powr-Dos w comands "OPEN"0:xxxx"...Is that command legal for all Disk Drives?

(Sysop Tony) Well, first off.... next time the problem happens with the printer,
  press the BREAK/PAUSE key instead of doing a cold start.   That should get
  you out of it with no ill effects.  On the "Will the program work with the
  TDD2" question, that depends on what the program does, how it works, what DOS
  you're using.... etc.  The 0: convention is the way the computer has of
  addressing an external device; some drives use 0:, and for brevity, some
  DOS's shorten that to just ":".  Whether that's supported with the DOS's
  that support the TDD2 is your real question and that's one that can't really
  be given a definitive answer, because we have no idea what "all" the DOS's
  do.  It's true with TS-DOS, the only DOS that we're aware of for the TDD2.
  While there are others who say they have one, or are working on one, or will
  release one.... TS-DOS is the only one available right now.

(GENE NESTRO) I use Powr-Dos (Acroatix) if I upload it  I'll call attention to
  the line # where it's used

(Sysop Tony) Let me assume that you're going to upload a program, and not
  Power-DOS itself. ...

(GENE NESTRO) correct!

(Sysop Tony) But I doubt that it's important to identify the line that the
  statement appears in.  It's a common disk-access statement.

(GENE NESTRO) OK if you don't think any precautions are necessary

(Sysop Tony) Well, I haven't seen your program, but I think it's
  over-cautious to worry about whether 0: will access the disk in other DOS's.
   You have to upload a program that works with what you've got, not what
  other's have.

(GENE NESTRO) It only loads ADRS.DO file from disk automatically or whatever

(Sysop Denny) Gene, Did you notice the examples given in the  Powr-DOS manual
  that allow you to load multiple programs and files from disk?  I use it to
  get 4 or 5 files loaded at once.

(GENE NESTRO) No but I will check it out  Thankx

(Sysop Denny) [page 71-72]

(R Caley) OK ... This is in relation to GENE's Q about the printer

(GENE NESTRO) Got it!  ga  done w/thread

(R Caley) I have had more than one person  get very strange results when using
  shift/print If they don't REMEMBER to hold the keys down  simultaneously. If
  you press <shift> <print> the width prompt comes up then if you hit <print>
  by itself you get weird results..

(GENE NESTRO) That may be it

(Sysop Tony) Actually...

(R Caley) My epson style printer goes into condensed print.

(Sysop Tony) I had one fellow who just couldn't get his printer to work - his
  complaint was that none of the printer commands worked... he couldn't get any
  output at all. Shift-Print didn't work, Print didn't work, and in BASIC,
  LPRINT didn't work. After a several message exchange, it turned out he had
  bought and plugged in an RS-232 printer.  (tee hee)  Which doesn't work
  with the built-in commands at all.  Enough on printers?  Or does anyone have
  any more? 

(R Caley) no

(GENE NESTRO) I'm finished

(Curtis G) Does it require a null modem to do  machine to machine file
  transferss with two model 100's ?

(Sysop Tony) Yes.

(Curtis G) so to change directions I have to move the modem from machine to
  machine?

(Sysop Tony) No.  You plug it inline with the cable that goes between the
  machines and it works both ways.

(Curtis G) Thanks Tony do you know if there is a  short utility in the
  data-base for performing this routine ?

(Sysop Tony) You don't really need any.  TELCOM will do it for you
  by uploading from one machine, and downloading in the other.  Or you can
  work directly in TEXT by "Loading from COM:nnnnn" in one, and "Saving to
  COM:nnnnn" in the other.

(Curtis G) That answers all my questions Thanks

(Sysop Denny) The file XFER.100 in DL3 gives the specifics of what Tony's
  explaining.  It is a lot faster to use BASIC and TEXT to do transfers than
  in TELCOM since you are limited to the scroll rate of  the receiving
  machine. With BASIC or TEXT you can xfer at 19.2K baud.

(Curtis G) thanks Denny

(Sysop Tony) The only quibble I have with that, is that in TELCOM you can see
  the file being received by the second machine.  First time users, might
  panic, if it's a long file, and there is no apparent action on the screen.
  Any more Curtis?

(Curtis G) No Thanks Tony

(GENE NESTRO) I use COM:98n1e or 87I1e & don't notice any difference  are they
  transf at 19,2 baud 

(Sysop Tony) 9 is twice as fast as 8  and is more likely to cause the DATE$
  bug to change your DATE.

(GENE NESTRO) It appears I'm going to have to  spend some time w/ my manuals!

(Sysop Denny) I haven't noticed much difference between 19.2K baud and 9.6K
  baud.  I think the clock speed of the computer is the limiting factor.

(Sysop Tony) Well, what we need is a definitive test.!!!  Somebody's got to
  make up a file, 10K or so, and try it at both speeds under all possible
  conditions.... and document all the variables.  Then he can send a message
  on the board about it and everyone can ignore it.  :-)

(Sysop Denny) [a burning issue]

(Sysop Tony) We've got to get this stuff documented!!!  ...  Step right up
  folks.... 2 Sysops!  No waiting!

(Phil) Howdy

(GENE NESTRO) Why must it be documented

(Robert D.) howdy Phil.

(Sysop Tony) We gotta get all this down in black and white.  We gotta get a
  file into the DL's!  We gotta know all about these machines, before they
  become obsolete.  [Does that sound obsessive?]

(GENE NESTRO) My wife wants to know why I'm laddinf so hard  (Thats laffing)

(Phil) [laddinf?  Me too!]

(Robert D.) Speaking of obsolete, has anyone heard ...

(Sysop Tony) (Gee, I haven't had a good laddinf for a long time!]

(Robert D.) anything about the new portable  that Tandy is about to launch on
  the 31st of October??

(Sysop Tony) In October?????

(Robert D.) yep, in October.

(Sysop Tony) They just launched one on August 3.  Is it already obsolete????
  ga Tell us about it.

(Phil) [not avail til oct]

(Robert D.) No. I heard it'll make the 102 and 200 obsolete as far as
  portables or laptops go.

(Sysop Denny) [delivery in Oct.]

(Phil) [not that one!]

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh!  Well, it seems we're talking about the same machine
  Introduced in August... In the stores in October. 

(Robert D.) yeah, that's the one!!

(Sysop Tony) It's not likely to make the 100 or 200 "obsolete", any more than
  the latest model of a car is going to make last years model obsolete.  There
  are many of us who have no interest... ABSOLUTELY no interest in MS-DOS.  I
  wouldn't walk across the street to see it.  But the new portable is going to
  be supported on the TRS80PRO forum, since they already deal with MS-DOS
  stuff.

(Phil) well  ya gotta look at some numbers.  If you like portability, and
  WANT ms-dos, you may not care for the new Tandy, since it weighs in at 13-14
  lbs.  Makes it one of the heavier (and bulkier) of the DOS portables.
  Generally seen as an excellent machine but try lugging that around after
  having a 100/200! in my view the best of the DOS portables has to be lighter,
  even if some compromises in functionality have to be made.

(Sysop Tony) Then there's the way that the "DOS folks" refer to their
  machines as "DOS machines", as if no other machine in the world had a
  DOS....  (grin)

(Phil) [well, type least possible in CO to keep time down!]

(Sysop Tony) Yeah... fix it in the editing (grin)

(Curtis G) Feel better now Tony ..

(Sysop Tony) (Was that a question, Curtis?)

(Curtis G) NO

(Robert D.) I was just wondering  how people got a hold of ...

(Phil) [tee-hee!]

(Robert D.) Portable 100 copies before CW Communications ...

(GEORGE MILLER) "L"

(Robert D.) started publishing it a couple of months ago.

(Phil) [ "L" ? Geo, what you mean?]

(Sysop Tony) George, What does "L" mean?  What are you trying to do?

(Curtis G) George use /Help for list of commands

(GEORGE MILLER) GET IN ON THE CONFERENCE. GO

(Sysop Tony) OK, George, We type a Q if we want to ask a question, or a C to
  comment on a current topic.   Last comment was on Portable 100 magazine.
  What was your comment?  ga

(Robert D.) who's the "ga" for?

(Sysop Tony) George.  ga George ga  (go ahead)

(GEORGE MILLER) JUST CKED HELP MESS'S

(Sysop Tony) OK.  ga Gene

(GEORGE MILLER) Q,

(GENE NESTRO) two sysops = no waiting...2 sysops + Phil = Comedy Corner

(Sysop Tony) Is that a dig at Phil????

(Robert D.) My question was how did people get a hold of ...

(GENE NESTRO) no, but this is a very funny CO  laddinf!

(Robert D.) Portable 100 before CW Communications  started publishing it a
  couple of months ago?

(Sysop Tony) Well, it was run by another company. They took subscriptions, and
  everything.  They also used to be available on the newsstands.  They also
  originally started this Forum; Then started one on Delphi;  Then started one
  on Genie - And are now out of business.

(Larry R.) Who's that??

(GEORGE MILLER) DO YOU KNOW ABOUT PICO?

(Sysop Tony) Portable 100  (Original version)

(Larry R.) O!

(Sysop Tony) Yes, we know about PICO... a lot more than many folks do.  (grin)

(Robert D.) The last couple of issues i managed to  get a hold of were very
  interesting I gave them a call for a one year subscription thanks to the
  info I got from Denny and friends in  the conference a while ago! Thanks!

(Sysop Tony) OK  Let's see, George is next.  ga George

(Geo.) I've a problem with DL 200 game  J.C.Wasserman's Golf.200  Can't get it
  to work all I get is ?Redo from start.  Any  suggestions?

(Sysop Tony) Sorry, I don't play Golf.  (grin)....  But  Redo from start is an
  error message in BASIC, which is telling you your number input is wrong.
  Either too many, or not enough, or something.

(Geo.) Then I've got some problems

(Sysop Denny) [alpha char. in numeric filed]

(Geo.) I don't have the knowledge to solve  problems (debug program).

(Sysop Tony) It may be that the program is expecting two numbers, separated by
  a comma, in the form 12,36 

(Phil) Yes, likely  the program is fine but your input is not.  As Tony says
  it may expect 23,45 or even 3,6,7 (sets of numbers) and you are giving it
  the wrong amount of data.  Check the documentation.

(Geo.) I've redone it all morning, since 3am this date. I down loaded from DL
  and copied data straight in.

(Sysop Tony) I can envision such a program  wanting two numbers indicating
  screen location.... x rows over, y rows down - Leave a message on the board
  about it to remind us, and someone will take a look at the program and get
  back to you.

(Geo.) Thanks!!

(Sysop Tony) OK... on to Larry   ga Larry

(Larry R.) OK  When I forget to turn my printer off  B4 turning off my M100,
  the low battery lamp goes on scaring the pluperfect hell out of me  anybody
  got any idea why that happens and does hurt anything other than my blood
  pressure AND  I'd like to hear about PICO, since I just got a subs. 'cos of
  the Laptop User

(Robert D.) (pluperfect hell?)

(Larry R.) fiasco. ga Whoever!!!

(Sysop Tony) Yep.  That happens.  .....  It's a common occurrence.  The
  printer has "ready" voltage on one of the lines,  Which is normally sunk to
  ground in the computer end.  When you turn off the computer, the voltage
  gets a chance to run around a little, and gets to the low battery light.  No
  real problem, but  it's always been recommended that you turn the computer
  on first, and off last.

  As for PICO (they pronouce it "Pie-Coe")  (No one can figure out why!)  It
  was started by Wayne Green, of some reputation in the publishing world who
  couldn't seem to get it to fly.  He sold it to the editor, Terry Kepner who
  continues to try.  At last report, they had a little over 8,000
  subscribers.  It's gone through two format changes, getting smaller each
  time. It's still around, but until Terry took it over, it covered the entire
  laptop field, in too much detail... no focal point. .... Terry is more 100
  oriented, but also covers the other portables as well; he just doesn't
  "cater" to them.

(Geo.) I get it, and all the previous editions too

(Larry R.) Back to the LB lamp. does what you said mean that no drain is
  taking place under the circumstances I cited?  That is the current running
  wild and just lighting the lamp and no real damage is done  provided I turn
  the LP off PDQ????

(Sysop Tony) That's a misconception about draining the batteries.
  Current drain, from the internal batteries in the computer, is ALWAYS
  taking place.  EXCEPT when you have the computer plugged into the wall, and
  there is AC in the socket.  Memory is held by current from the batteries
  the AA's and if they fail, or are removed, THEN by the little nicad inside.
  However, as it relates to your question, there is probably no problem in
  seeing the LB lamp light, as it's probably simply a case of reverse biasing
  somewhere - however, it's not recommended, simply because it isn't DEFINED
  what it CAN do. It may, or may not, cause problems.  If it happens accidently,
  don't worry about it.  But don't do it to show your neighbors what happens.

(Phil) Oppedahls  book (pp. 184-185) discusses this and recommends
  installation of a diode to eliminate backflow from printer (with ckt dgms)
  of course, that is probably cosmetic only.  When light is on current is
  flowing from printer to M100 to light it.  Problably no big deal.

(Sysop Tony) Any more on that, Larry?

(LARRY R.) As I said, I usually turn LP off 1st  but when echoing some things
  online I will sometimes 4get I have LP on  since I can't easily see it's
  little red lamp glowing.  Thanks 4 putting my mind at some ease.

(Sysop Tony) OK....  You're up now, Adam.   ga Adam

(ADAM SCULL) 2 THINGS... FIRST IM A USER OF YOUR FORUM FOR BOUT 7 MONTHS I
  JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I REALLY ENJOY IT AND HOPE EVERYONE AND YOU  TONY KEEP
  UP THE GREAT WORK.. FOR MY QUESTION, DO U KNOW WHATEVER HAPPEND TO THE MAG
  LAPTOP USER?

(LARRY R.) HMM!

(Sysop Tony) Adam, let me suggest you type shorter lines.  About Laptop User;
   There was a good chance for them to make a go of it when there was no
  other magazine in the field.  But when CW Communications resurrected
  Portable 100 there was one too many.  Also, during the period that there
  were no magazines to speak of, many of those who formerly advertised, went
  out of business, so there were few advertisers for Laptop User ...

(ADAM SCULL) IS PORT100 NATL AGAIN?

(Sysop Tony) to approach.  They were primarily an "Advertiser Supported"
  magazine.  No advertsers, no money, it's as simple as that.  Portable 100 is
  "National", in the sense they will sell to anyone, anywhere if that's what
  you mean.  I've seen them in Dalton Bookstores on the magazine ...

(ADAM SCULL) DO U KNOW WHEN IT WILL ACTUALLY HIT THE STANDS AGAIN, IF NOT
  ALREADY?

(Sysop Tony) rack, too.  Since they also print 80-micro, they already have a
  distribution network set up.  ......  How about waiting until I'm through
  before asking the next question.  They have been out for two months now.

(ADAM SCULL) SORRY FOR JUMPING..OK THANKS FOR THE INFO

(Sysop Tony) finished?

(ADAM SCULL) YES, AND THANKS AND SORRY IF JUMPED QUESTIONS!

(Sysop Tony) OK.... it's customary to type "ga" when you're done with ...

(ADAM SCULL) ok

(Sysop Tony) a thought, in order to let the next guy know he can start.   And
  "Done" when you've finished a topic, helps.  John is up next.  ga John

(JOHN FENIMORE) I AM WITH THE U.S. ARMY EXHIBIT TEAM  WE HAVE 20 TEAMS
  TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY AT A TIME WE MAY ONLY BE IN A LOCATION FOR I
  NIGHT SO WE USE ACC COUPLERS WE USE M1OO'S IN A TEST PROGRAM.  THIS GIVES US
  ACCSESS TO A LARGE MAINFRAME WITH A LARGE DATA BASE  THE PROBLEM IS WITH
  STATIC ON THE Telephone line if enough teams do not use the system we will
  lose access to the main frame.

(Sysop Tony) THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT... IT'S A PHONE COMPANY
  PROBLEM.

(JOHN FENIMORE) Is there a better acc coupler other than the one radio sh
  sells?

(Sysop Tony) No, not really. Most users have found direct connections to be
  better, and have developed ways to make connections direct to the line.
   But the acoustic couplers for the 100's are specially designed for the
  100's, and there is no substitute.  There are other acoustic modems, but
  they would have to be connected as external modems.

(Robert D.) Just wanted to ask John, do you stay in hotel rooms,  or do you
  have to use public phones to access the mainframe?

(JOHN FENIMORE) i stay in hotel rooms. I use a direct connection all the
  time I either plug into the wall or remove the wall plate and wire direct
  I've done this so many times that I could probably work for the phone
  company, its the other teams that don't want the hassle.

(Sysop Tony) Well, you've got the technique down!  It's well known that
  acoustic cups are less reliable. ...

(Robert D.) Done John?

(Sysop Tony) But short of training all your other users  how to do that,
  you'll always have problems with the cups.

(JOHN FENIMORE) yes thanks DONE

(Sysop Tony) OK  Ron is next,  ga Ron Rivers

(RON RIVERS) One quick ?  Where would I find TCOMP.121 in DL's

(Sysop Tony) DL8 - Programming section.

(RON RIVERS) Thanks. Done

(GENE NESTRO) Tony, you were WONDERFUL TODAY   DONE

(Sysop Tony) (tee hee) ..... Why, I don't know *what* you MEAN, Gene. .....
  ;-)

(Phil) [Shheezh! Don't tell Tony things like that. He's bad enuff already!!]

(Sysop Tony) Well, it looks like we're out of time for this morning's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming this morning, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.

   *** END OF FORMAL CONFERENCE ***


(Sysop Tony) Phil, maybe you and Denny should Co-op purchase a 200 so you'd
  have it for development of various things.

(Phil) Well, not likely I will and we are too far apart (an hour) to share
  hardware. (an hr!) Only interest is when I have a new source for the M100 to
  convert to 200 and that does not happen often  and I really dislike the
  screen (looks hazy to me) on the 200's I've used.  Prefer M100 screen.  But
  very personal, I know!

(Sysop Tony) Hazy?  It's supposed to be Matte finish to cut down reflections.
   But that's another one of those personal taste things.  I really like it
  better than the 100.

(Phil) Iknow.  Toshiba  made the same change form 1100+ to 1000 and I prefer
  the reflective serface, because the sharp reflections are easier to position
  out in an office environment than all the diffuse stuff.  But I am  managing
  with the T1000 now.

(Sysop Tony) I'm kind-of getting tired of the 100/200/600....  maybe it's time
  for me to move on to another computer.  There's just so Damn much stuff to
  port over, though!

(Phil) Well, if you rule out the MS-DOS stuff, there are not too many other
  lappers except the $$$$ for a Mac laptop copmpatible.

(Sysop Tony) Well... I'd probably go to the Tosh 1000.... you seem to like it,
  and  that recommendation carries *some* weight.

(Phil) Yeah, I really do like it --- tho with no PC Desktop, you would likely

(Sysop Tony) (The $800 price range sounds reasonable, too.)

(Phil) want a second drive (it has a port for ext floppy)

(Sysop Tony) Thanks... see you next week.
