                Boston Computer Society
                Laptop Group
                Tuesday, April 28, 1987
                Boston Globe, Boston Massachusetts

        The meeting started at 7:00 p.m., Tuesday, April 28, 1987, at the 
Boston Globe.  Despite the snowstorm(!!!) enough people showed up to take 
every available chair in the room.  (Please note:  a snowstorm at the end 
of April is abnormal even by Boston standards.)

        Al Goldman introduced the meeting subject:  computer-to-computer 
communications.  The model 100 and 102 work very well for communications 
with their built-in modems; the desktop computers are a little more 
difficult to use.  Al described a program available from Compuserve called 
FLTIBM.DOC.  This program runs on the IBM PC or compatible computer and 
allows easy file transfers.

        You can connect your Model 100 to your PC either through a 
telephone line or directly by using a "null modem cable."  Al passed out a 
handout which included a wiring diagram for a null modem (also available 
from Radio Shack, catalog number 26-1496).  A null modem has a male DB25 
connector and a female DB 25 connector.  The pins are connected as 
follows:

        Bill Gerber, the meeting moderator, introduced Scott Anderson of 
Traveling Software who spoke about the TS products LAPDOS and MACDOS, with 
which you can connect the Tandy Portable Disk Drive to the IBM PC or 
compatible and the Macintosh, respectively.  He also showed Traveling 
Software's "Laplink" -- this allows you to transfer data between two 
MS-DOS machines, for instance machines that use different size disks.  
("Brooklyn Bridge" is a similar program.)  Laplink comes with all the 
necessary cables and program disks.  It transfers at 115,000 Baud, 
connecting the serial ports of the two machines.  Each end of the cable 
has a DB-25 and a DB-9 plug so that you can plug it into any machine.  
LAPDOS and MACDOS are $95 apiece, and LAPLINK is $125.

        Bill Gerber then introduced Ted Rider of RCA to speak about 
uploading and downloading data from the DEC VAX.  Ted handed out a 
simple-to-follow recipe for transferring files to the VAX and back using 
the VMS operating system on the VAX.  Here it is:

Question:  Do your files have to end with control-Z?  Answer:  Haven't 
been doing that; someone suggested that this may be why the VAX requires a 
Control-C at the end to get its attention.

Note:  switches on side of Model 100 must be set to ORIG and DIR.


        The next speaker (whose name I didn't catch) works with the BCS 
Education group and spoke on transferring files from the Tandy 102 to the 
Macintosh using Red Ryder.  Red Ryder is a "shareware" telecommunications 
program for he Macintosh.  When a file is uploaded to the Macintosh, the 
result is a TEXT file; MacWrite will automatically convert it to a 
"MacWrite" file.  Question:  is there a limit to the buffer size?  Ans:  
Probably limited to memory in Mac; a bigger problem is occasional garbled 
characters.  The transfer is done without any error checking.  

        Scott Anderson noted that you may get better results with the 
Modem port; reason is that the printer port is not designed for lots of 
characters coming in. The modem port is optimized for very fast character 
input.

        Seth Froelich told us about Disk+.  This is really 2 programs, one 
of which you run on a desktop machine, the other of which is a ROM chip 
for the model 100 or 102.  You install the ROM chip and CALL 63012 on the 
Model 100; on the main menu you will now see DISK+.  This program 
basically allows you to use the desktop's disk drive as your disk drive 
for the Model 100.  Kind of the mirror image of Lapdos/Macdos.

        You connect the two machines with a null-modem cable and run the 
desktop program and DISK+.  You can look at the list of files in the Model 
100 or on the desktop's disk, transferring files up and down.  The files 
are stored in a special format; on the desktop machine you use utility 
programs (supplied) to convert the files for use on the desktop computer.  
Programs written in Basic for the Model 100 will often run on the IBM PC.

        Question:  What desktop machines are supported?  Answer: Apple II, 
TRS-80 model 1, 2, 4, MS-DOS machines (including IBM PC, Tandy 1000 etc.), 
many others.  (It did not run on Seth's Hewlett Packard MS-DOS machine  -- 
it crashed.)

        Mr. Froelich also has an HP-110.  He has a special card inside his 
IBM PC called a HP82973A HPIL Interface card.  Then he runs HPLINK on the 
IBM; the portable machine appears to be disks D and E on the IBM.

        Question:  After you send a file from the Model 100 to the IBM, is 
it useable and editable on the IBM?  Ans:  Usually; it is in ASCII.  Note: 
IBM Basic is a little different; requires spaces within lines where Model 
100 doesn't.  A program on Compuserve, EXPAND.BA, will add the spaces.

        Next speaker was Jim Franklin, our host (representing the Boston 
Globe).  He has an Epson Geneva and uses public-domain programs; they are 
cheap but sometimes flukey or hard to use.  He described programs similar 
to FLTIBM for CP/M machines such as Kaypro, Osborne and Epson Geneva.

        SIGEA Systems, scheduled to be present, unfortunately did not make 

it, so Mark Lutton talked about their Telecommuter product (as a user; he 
is not a representative of SIGEA).  First of all, this program provides a 
word processor and telecommunications for the IBM PC that are as simple to 
use as the ones on the Model 100.  As if that weren't enough, there is a 
built-in, easy fast file transfer between the PC and the Model 100.  But 
wait, there's more:  you get exactly the right kind of null modem cable.  
AND you can set the PC up in Host Mode so you can call it with your Model 
100 and transfer files or run DOS commands remotely.

        The meeting was opened to questions and answers.  As usual someone 
asked, "How do you get line feeds out of the Model 100?" so here is the 
answer yet again:
        To automatically add linefeeds when a file is uploaded through the 
serial port or sent to a serial printer, in BASIC POKE 63066,1.  To reset 
to normal, POKE 63066,0.
        To add linefeeds for a parallel printer, use LFUTL.PW1, available 
from the Model 100 SIG on Compuserve in DL7.

        The meeting then degenerated into the usual free-for-all and 
everyone went home through the snow.
