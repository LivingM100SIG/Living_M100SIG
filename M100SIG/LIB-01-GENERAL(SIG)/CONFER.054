(larry l) morning all

(Sysop Tony) Good old Larry....
  Good Morning.

(larry l) am i that dependable?

(Sysop Tony) First one here... first question... Yeah!

(larry l) I missed co last week
  we seem to be here by ourselves..must
  be the holiday.

(Sysop Tony) Or the national hand-holding service.  (grin)

(larry l) you could take your m100 to the line.

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, with a long telephone cable.

(larry l) cellular phone..?

(Sysop Tony) Not at 25 cents a minute!

(larry l) does it cost that much?

(Sysop Tony) Some places it's 45 cents.

(larry l) yeesh.  someone else just connected

(Sysop Tony) Plus a $25-$30 monthly basic fee.

(larry l) well forget cellular

(Sysop Tony) For those in business, where it's deductable, the government
  pays for part of it.

(larry l) you meen we pay for it

(Sysop Tony) That, too!

(larry l) I have been using my apple more lately.. and the portable less.

(Sysop Tony) I've been eating more apples lately, and enjoying them less...
  (grin)

(larry l) (chuckle) doesn't look like this CO will amount to much.
  Who's lurking?

(Sysop Tony) Last weeks didn't either... called at 3/4 time due to lack of
  interest.  where?

(larry l) yse i read the transcript there is a third person on.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, obviously. 

(W Brad Walls) just me

(larry l) hiya Brad,what's up?

(W Brad Walls) just seeing whats going on

(Zot-------*) Good morning  How's everyone this morning?

(larry l) not much today..but it is usually much livlier.
  hi zot

(Zot-------*) Ive got a question

(Sysop Tony) ga Zot with your question. ga

(Zot-------*) I was writting Basic program to use...
  A formatted printed report...
  In order to get borders I had to use...
  for x=0 to 78:lorint"-";:next x:lprint" "
  question is why did I have to insert the last Lprint statement ?  ga

(Sysop Tony) Because....
  Your "Lprint"-"" ended with a semi colon...
  which told the printer to remain on the same line....
  If that were allowed to stand, the next line you send to the printer...
  would start at the end of the dashes. ga

(Zot-------*) Yes but the next print...
  Statement was LPRINT "whatever","whatever" and that really screwed...
  up the columns...  Is what I did correct syntax? GA

(Sysop Tony) You don't need to include a space after that Lprint...
  LPRINT alone will close the line and return the print head to the start of...
  the next line. ga

(Zot-------*) But I have the right Idea I mean if it works dont fix it right?ga

(Sysop Tony) May I suggest a better way to do it??? ga

(Zot-------*) Of course  ga

(Sysop Tony) Delete the for-next loop entirely....
  use this:  LPRINT STRING$(78,"-")  ga

(Zot-------*) Will this work on any TRS Machine & printer (its for school) ? GA

(Sysop Tony) No, it works on the Model 100, the Tandy 200, and with
  MicroSoft's BASIC for the Tandy computers. ga

(Zot-------*) What would work for Model 2 ?
  Imean 3.ga

(Sysop Tony) I don't know... we don't support the Model 2 here, or
  the Model 3 either. ga

(Zot-------*) OK I guess Im looking for a cure all Im finished W/my ?.

(Sysop Tony) OK... ga Larry ga

(larry l) thanks... I was just wondering what perks you get from...
  CIS for being a SYSOP  ga

(Sysop Tony) I have an account number which allows me free access throughout
  most of the system, without charge.  ga

(larry l) wow...  where do I sign up.ga done

(Sysop Tony) There's a long line.... (grin) 
  OK....

(Zot-------*) Q?

(Sysop Tony) ga Zot ga

(Zot-------*) Tony what do Sysops actually do ...
  Do they actually operate CIS mainframe... or do they work from home?

(Sysop Tony) It differs from forum to forum...
  each having duties specific to his forum's field of interest....
  There is the message board to monitor...
  the database to maintain....
  Files to verify and merge....
  Messages to send...

(larry l) (work..work..work..work..)

(Sysop Tony) Training and help via EasyPlex....
  Conferences to moderate....
  Then there is the business of administering a business...
  and the input and participation of the management team....
  Most work from home... as I am now.  None of us actually have access...
  to the mainframes.  ga

(larry l) c

(Sysop Tony) ga Larry ga

(larry l) Tony..

(Matt S.) c

(larry l) what sort of business you in? I'm an electronic tech.
  ga

(Sysop Tony) I'm a motion picture film engineer, with a BS in audio
  engineering working on a master's degree.  ga

(larry l) real neat..I work with medical eqpt..ga

(Matt S.) String$ command works on M3  ga

(Sysop Tony) OK... thanks.

(Zot-------*) Q?

(Sysop Tony) ga Zot ga

(Zot-------*) If youve typed in a line and have changed youre mind....
  How do you delete that line from the transfer buffer ?  ga

(Sysop Tony) Control-U will erase it.  ga

(Zot-------*) Tony do you get paid cash for being a sysop? ga

(Sysop Tony) No.  ga

(Zot-------*) done
  users
  sorry.ga

(Sysop Tony) 'sallright!

(Thom) 'Morning, Tony!  Q

(Sysop Tony) Good Morning Thom.... ga

(Thom) Do you - or anybody else here, have any experience using the PRTEXT
  series of programs in  DL0 to maintain a large mailing list with a TDD? ga

(Sysop Tony) I have not used the programs, but spent two days...
  finding out why the checksum is not correct.  ga

(Thom) And why isn't it correct?? ga

(Sysop Tony) There is an embedded TAB in line 4 of the program.  ga

(Thom) Do I need to fix that before running the program?  ga

(Sysop Tony) Not necessarily.  If you downloaded with Xmodem, it's fine.  ...
  If you downloaded with capture, and your PROFILE is set for REAL TABS...
  it's fine.  If not, you got spaces instead of the TAB, and the checksum...
  is wrong, but the program will run.  ga

(Thom) OK.  I'm gonna try it, I think.

(Jean Grossholtz) hello

(David K.) hello

(Sysop Tony) Finished, Thom?  ga

(Thom) Any conversations with PG design recently? ga

(Sysop Tony) Last time I talked to Peter was 2 years ago at the LA show.  ga

(Thom) Ah, so.  Have you heard of any 
  DOS's for the 200 on ROM?  ga

(Sysop Tony) No.  ga

(Thom) That's all for me.  Have a great weekend!

(Sysop Tony) Thanks....

(Zot-------*) Q for Thom.

(Sysop Tony) (Jean and David... we aren't ignoring you...

(David K.) ok

(Sysop Tony) we just don't recognize folks when they come in and say "hi".)
  ga Zot ga

(Zot-------*) Thom are you there whats ur Job ?  ga

(Thom) 63 ga

(Zot-------*) thanks wait a min I wnat to talk.done

(Sysop Tony) Zot... do you want to talk, or are you done??? ga
  OK....  They're off in the back room, talking...

(DAVID P. WESTHEAD) HE;LP/HELP

(Sysop Tony) Start again, David... put the slash at the left margin.
  ga Curtis ga

(Curtis G) tony do you know of a fix to add the ".DO" to files sent to the chip
  drive? ga

(Sysop Tony) Under what conditions?  ga

(Curtis G) files downloaded from the sig.ga

(Thom) see ya all later.

(Sysop Tony) You should specify the ".DO" at the time you open the file for
  downloading. ga

(Curtis G) does not seem to work , aborts download..ga

(Sysop Tony) Nah.... I do it all the time... twice this morning, so far....

(Curtis G) I'm running SXM.CHP..ga

(Sysop Tony) You press the F2 key, then type "0:name.DO" and press the ...
  ENTER key.  ga
  Well then....

(Curtis G) OK i'll give it a try thanks..ga

(Sysop Tony) You should read the documentation, or consult the author.  ga

(Zot-------*) c

(Sysop Tony) ga Zot ga

(Zot-------*) PRehaps his buffer was filled?  ga

(Sysop Tony) Not likely.  ....
  I can see no way to fail to download to the disk...
  the filename extension if a "buffer" is full.  ga

(Zot-------*) Oh sorry I wasent following the converstaion...
  done. ga

(Sysop Tony) OK>....

(David K.) q

(Sysop Tony) ga David ga

(David K.) Hi. I just got the very economical TDD.
  It works nicely, but would you...
  recomend some of the better...
  enhancements in the DLs? ga

(Sysop Tony) Congratulations...

(David K.) Thanks

(Sysop Tony) You'll find a lot of stuff for the TDD in DL5.  Just go in and
  read the TDD catalog, TDD.CAT, and search for new files with the search
  command  S/KEY TDD  or S/KEY PDD.  (Some folks....
  like to call it the "Portable Disk Drive"....
  Not realizing there are a half-dozen "Portable" Disk Drives available now. ga

(David K.) Ok, thanks.  What do you think is the...
  best commercial DOS for it?  ga

(Sysop Tony) As a forum administrator, I cannot recommend one product over
  another.  There are product descriptions and reviews in DL6 on....
  almost all the available products.  ga

(David K.) Ok.. I'll check them out.. Thanks, bye.. done.

(Sysop Tony) OK...

(Zot-------*)  Whom is the representative for TRS products on...
  This or other PCS sig's ?G.A.

(Sysop Tony) The Tandy employee...
  Who is the SIG representative, and who acts as liaison...
  between us and the corporation, is Tana Grubb, 76703,2041.  ...
  She is the SIG representative on all the Tandy forums.  ga

(Zot-------*) Can I obtain software and products from Her ?ga

(Sysop Tony)  No, you cannot.  She deals only with forum support....
  You can obtain software and products from your local Radio Shack store. ga

(Zot-------*) No can do little support for MODEL100 & NO Repair for an antique
  (MODEL I) "... Dont laugh. ga

(Sysop Tony) Are you asking if Tana can support the Model 100 or the Model 1?

(Zot-------*) Look I went to a dealer and he told me that ...
  I could not find a "Mini Disk" the cheaper one...
  Any where. GA

(Sysop Tony) What do you mean by "Mini Disk"?  I've not heard that phrase as
  referring to anything in particular.  ga

(Zot-------*) The TRS "portable"
  Im finished for Now. Thanks for youe help. GA

(Sysop Tony) If you mean that the dealer told you the product was not
  available, he was in error.  It is available lots of places, and I can
  walk into stores in this area and pick one up anytime.  ga

(Steve Z) Q for Mike Anders, if he's here...  Did you find the latest version
  for the 'munk, and how can i upgrade my Munk?

(Sysop Tony) He's not here.

(Steve Z) Oh, well, to the message board!  GA tony

(Sysop Tony) OK...  General info....
  You can upgrade your munk by doing it yourself, or sending it to the
factory. How much of an upgrade do you need?  ga

(Steve Z) I've got software v 1.2 & ROM (CDOS) v3.41, and think the latest are
  1.4 & 3.45. ~Ga

(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's correct....
  Message Mike, and he'll send you the stuff, and you can send him back the...
  old versions.  ga

(Steve Z) Will do.  Just in passing, I'm on the ZP this AM, if my typing seems
  erratic. GA

(Sysop Tony) Not really... we get the finished lines, not the mistakes!  (grin)
  Did you get your Email? ga

(Steve Z) Yes, and I've got it going pretty well on the 200.  I added MSPLAN 
  TO THE menu and, rather than Error 57, added a branch to print "MP work area
  in use" and give a beep, just like the real thing.  Still needs a little more
  work, tho.  GA

(Sysop Tony) Even more DIABOLICAL!!!

(DaveW.) Does anyone know an...
  address and phone number for the...
  Tandy Technical Center in Texas? ga

(Sysop Tony) Well....
  You can call Tandy in Fort Worth at (817) 878-4867, and ask.
  ga Curtis ga

(Curtis G) would'n tana know?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, and that's her number, too.  ga
  You may also find some numbers in the Tandy Newsletter... GO TANDY.  ga

(DaveW.) O.K. will give it a try...
  am trying to add a speech synthesizer..
  to my M100 and need more info...
  about one of the chips R/S sells. ga

(Sysop Tony) Did you see the file TALKER.INF in DL6? ga

(DaveW.) Have looked at it already. ga

(Sysop Tony) OK....

(Curtis G) Tony do you know...
  what type of equipment and software...
  would be requires to set up a ...
  system to the sig on a private basis? ga

(Sysop Tony) Can you rephrase that?  "set up a system to the sig" doesn't
  quite communicate your idea.  ga

(DaveW.) [You mean a BBS?]

(Curtis G) mail waiting and the like..ga
  yes...ga

(Sysop Tony) Do you mean you want to set up a private SIG?  ....
  Do you mean on CompuServe or in your own home?  ga

(Curtis G) an in house system for a small tv station...
  ga

(Sysop Tony) A private company BBS can be set up....
  using almost any computer or computer system...
  given the software, hardware, and an interest....
  There are many possible combinations...
  the Model 100 is not among them....

(Jay M.) [wanna bet?]

(Sysop Tony) It is too limited for such a use in a business setting.  See the
  file REMOTE.USE in DL1 for some ideas....

(Curtis G) Thanks Tony...ga

(DaveW.) A number of people have set-up....
  private BBSs utilizing the M100....
  but the necessity of large amounts...
  of memory space make it a poorer...
  choice than other machines.....
  some necessities would be disk access..
  and auto-answer modem capability. ga

(Zot-------*) sorry to make you wait
  Ive got another BASIC Q.
  ok is there any way to renumber lines in....
  a basic prog. including go sub's & such ?  ga

(Sysop Tony) Yes...
  You want a freebie, or willing to buy a real good program?  ga

(Zot-------*) Quess ga

(Sysop Tony) Well, the freebie is in DL4....
  It's called RENUM.100, and renumbers a program in it's ascii version,...
  in other words, a .DO file.  The commercial version is machine language,...
  and renumbers the BASIC program itself.  It's described...
  in DL6 in the file RENUM.PRD.  ga

(Zot-------*) Excellent ! Best tip Ive had in weeks....
  Thanks . done ga

(Sysop Tony) OK....
  Testing, one, two three....

(Terry G) Thanks,...
  Has anyone had any experience...
  with either of the super ROM's? ga

(Jay M.) I just got the PCSG Super ROM, and while my experience is limited...
  to the past week or so, it appears to do exactly as advertised. For me, it...
  warrants its name. Is there a specific question, or are you just looking for
  an overall feel? ga

(Terry G) Primarily...
  I have no need for a spreadsheet prm...
  and was wordering which of the two...
  PCSG or T/S Ultimate would serve my...
  needs the best...
  I have a TDD and was looking at the...
  DOS offered by T/S. ga

(Sysop Tony) Terry....
  It has generally been bandied about...
  that SUPER ROM is a spreadsheeter's ROM....
  while ULTIMATE ROM II is a word-processor's ROM....
  that seems to be the direction each favors....  Of course, PCSG offers no...
  DOS, but it will load FLOPPY.CO if you lose it....
  Ultimate will load TS-DOS, and can read files from the disk...
  without the DOS being loaded.

(Jay M.) Reading and writing files to/from the TDD with Super is not directly
  possible; you must load them in and out with one of the utility programs.
  Super's word-processing isn't bad, but it's not the best either (note: I'm a
  confirmed WordStar bigot), but it's thought outliner qualifies as neat
  stuff. ga

(Terry G) I have used IDEA!...
  and really liked the way it handled...
  multiple levels of thought processing...
  The only problem was the speed....
  I understand that the speed has been...
  greatly increased in the ROM version...
  and based on these few comments...
  it appears that the Utlimate ROM...
  looks like the "ultimate" choice...
  at this time...
  Thanks. done ga

(Sysop Tony) Terry....
  You'll find a bunch of files in DL6 from Traveling Software, all preceeded...
  by the letters TS... as in TS????.PRD... True, Idea has been improved...
  but the great advantage of TS-DOS is being able to convert your programs...
  to access disk files.  And you can load and save files to disk in BASIC...
  or TEXT.  

(Terry G) Thanks for all the help. Lunch is ready..good day!
