(Leonard E.) is there some way that you sysops can be 'invisible' to /ust?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) there is no SPECIAL way that isn't available to others.
  1) we can be in another channel and not show up with "/UST 30" command though
  we would show with "/UST" command. We sometimes use another channel to sit
  with another computer and /MON the conference for a cleaner transcript.
  2) folks are invisible when they scramble, I think.

(GENE NESTRO) dave is there a way to search/finf uploads by pin #'s?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes Gene there is and it can be VERY handy if a person has a
  fine reputation for good stuff, like Woods Martin.
  the Scan command for filenames only is ...
  S[76703,446]
  and the BRO command is just like it ...
  BRO[76703,4062]
  Note there is no space between the command and the [


(Leonard E.) Being an 'old-timer' I still use Cat [7xxx,xxx] a lot.
 (and Cat /des & other such goodies) are they still going?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) L, don't see why you continue with 3 keystrokes when one will
  do; the S command replaced the CAT command over two years ago though CAT is
  still supported. Try HELP CAT in the Data Library though and see what you
  get!! Don't know how much longer the software will support CAT.
(Leonard E.) I guess I'm just too lazy to learn the new commands. After all,
 I've been using CAT for 5 years. And I never really bothered to check out the
 'new' commands!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well speaking of which I'll have a few comments about the NEW
  new software coming up HERE on the 24th though it has been installed in some
  Forums already and will go in others this coming week.


(larry l) Does your answer mean that one can search for a file when the DL #
 is not known but the file name is?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope! Did I misunderstand Gene's question?? All I thought he
  asked was how to search a specific DL for a known User ID's files.
(larry l) Is there any way to search the DL Lib. globally?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, and I seriously doubt that there will be.
  The way I do that is search my copy of INDEX on my Tandy 1000 disks. But that
  is for filename or User ID only, not keywords.


(Leonard E.) First, a comment. Larry, if you are using an external modem,
 just exit TELCOM & type the search command (BRO /key:tdd for example)
 in a file & then CUT it into the paste buffer then return to telcom. After
 that it only takes one keystroke to do the search and a couple more to change
 DL's
 Now for my question...
 Have they implemented a way to search for files *older* than a given number of
 days? (say by /age: -100 to get files older than 100 days?)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Nope, and I haven;t seen any talk about it as being in
  planning at all. Will take a check on it, but not for a while since everybody
  is going to be nutty for the next couple of weeks.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) I'd like to pass along  some of my thinking about the new
  software so that I can get feedback from you and transcript readers before we
  start moving stuff. Note that 24-Nov is when we are due to get new software
  described in FORUM.TXT; see FORUM.NEW if you're not cawt up on July's changes
  as yet.
  Starting on 24th we'll start moving stuff in the Data Library into new areas.
  Definite: separate DL for Tandy 600 stuff.
  Probable: All TEXT/print formatters will go into their own DL.
  Org will be sump'n like this for the DLs only:
    0 Help/Index
    1 to ? Model 100 Applications ...
    then 100 Technical and Peripheral ...
    then Tandy 600
    then NEC stuff.
  Message sections will probably be reduced. No FANTASTIC fast changes.
  I intend to take it easy. That's it for now.
(Phil W) [T-600 DL = "Dave's Corner"]


(Phil W) There was a Q on the SIG this a.m. re download to TDD from modem.
 It may be worth noting (again) that 'tis not a capability which can be
 achieved without EXTREME measures, 'tho someone has done so by using another
 modem to hold the comm port when writing to disk.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yep, I responded to the fella in the same vein as you did.
  Don't bermember the file in DL 1 that talks about it.


(GENE NESTRO) re:power-dos/ PL.BA.
 did anyone notice antthing unusual in the listing of PL.Ba
(Phil W) it has some graphics stuff in it that does not list very well.
(GENE NESTRO) rite on!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Suspect that it is similar to SUPERA.BA in that it is not
  really a Basic program but is calling to machine code in esoteric manners.
(Phil W) Exactly so! A number of vendors use that technique, storage of m/l
 routines in string variables of (non-ascii) characters.  What they look like
 is a function of the displaying device.  But it is a fairly normal way to
 stuff m/l into a basic program.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And David Sumner of Micro Demon's SUPERA was the first!


(Phil W) If leonard is here, have you done anything more with your dictionary
 compression ideas?
(Leonard E.) Not really. I do have packed versions of the DICT files on *one*
 TDD; when I get around to it I'll have to see about implementing the check
 files, but it's gonna be a *loooong* time.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Note that NEXT week we'll have Mark Eppley here as guest to
  discuss Traveling's new TS-RANDOM operating system that I understand is for
  the Tandy portable disk drive.
(Phil W) That will be an interesting CO, tho there are not too many copies out
 yet, I suspect! TS-RANDOM is a very different product and concept from any of
 the TDD OS's yet released.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Folks should keep in mind that our Email whiz has a new
  program ready that will do auto reading and sending of messages on the Forum
  message board as well or instead of Email work. Should be published here the
  week that the new software is activated here. That is, no later than the end
  of the month.
  Methinks.


(Phil W) what ever happened to Howard Benner?  We need another programming
 contest to liven things up.  Maybe with a special '600 section for you and
 tony and a couple of others! 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) har de har har ...
  Howard seems to have deserted us for the halls of MS-DOS and the ATO program.
  His OMNINFO firm has him busy, but not with Model 100 support. When Marv has
  his new program published I intend to remove Howard's smart stuff here since
  he no longer supports it.
(Phil W) well I guess support IS very important to something which must track
 to vagaries of the CIS-ware!  Glad Howard is so busy, which may alss mean
 successful.  Guess we need a "where are they now" file!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) He is even a sysop! And I see him on the Sysop Forum from time
  to time.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) By the way, our CAPABILITY for message sections will increase
  to 18 areas but we will more than likely DECREASE.
  Comments? Why have a bunch of places to dash to? Not needed in the manner of
  the Data Library. 
  Methinks.
(Leonard E.) I noticed that when you listed the probable DL's, you omitted
 the 200.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) That is correct. MOST of the 100 software will run on the 200.
  The only REAL problems are the machine code stuff;even PRINT@ can be adjusted
  for. If we have a Tandy 200 section, folks will think that ONLY those
  programs will run in the 200 when, in fact, we'll have hundreds more that
  run.
(Phil W) There is one issue about that. Some of the "Basic" programs have pokes
 and peeks which will not permit them to run on both machines. It would be a
 good idea for someone (Tony, who has both machines?) to create a file which
 notes which are which in some manner. I agree on the "no separate section"
 idea.  But it may still lead to some problems.  Personally, I think the T200
 may be the machine of choice in the future, since it has bank capability...
 all depending on the success vendors have with the M102 expansion problem.
 So there may be more 200 users and more 200 software 

[...... Sysop .^Dave^. gawt dumped for a few minutes ......]

(RICH L ) the programs over for the 200....
(Phil W) [Oh!} dumb me
(RICH L ) I have both too.....I did want to say Atlanta got....`
 it's first Chipmonk here last month.....
(Phil W) But Rich -- not that easy, since that table is very incomplete!


(Neil S.) I read FORUM.TXT, but I don't remember a list of new catagories;
 but, with over 2300 files, my instinct would be for not decreasing the # of
 DLs. The 200 is different enuf that I've long thot it should have it's own
 board section, and, as I've stated before, I feel the DLs should match.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) FORUM.TXT is generic for all Forums. When you read this
  transcript you'll see the way I'm THINKING about organizing.
  No 200 separation. Methinks.
(Phil W) Agree with Dave on this.


(Leonard E.) It might be a thought to try to put together a set of lists
 (perhaps in their own dl?) of programs for various setups.
 for example: Files that work on 200, files that don't, and possibly those that
 haven't been checked. Same for DVI, TDD, chipmunk, etc...
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummm, hummm. Quite a project when you carry it beyond just
  the 200 files!
(Leonard E.) well, that's why I suggested a 'not yet checked' file.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Mebbe Tony could tackle the 200 aspect.
(Phil W) Maintaining the updates on a "checked" file would be a pain.
 I think it would be enough to look at the code for peeks and pokes and other
 m/l peculir stuff.  If there, it is machine-peculiar.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not necessarily. James Yi, amongst others, writes programs
  that adapt to the computer in use for CALLs et cetera.
(Phil W) Ah so, but when they do, they generally say EXPLICITLY that they
 will run on both machines.  I'm talking about the more innocent programs
 including gratuitious calls and pokes that have not been reviewed by the
 author for compatibility.
 but taint worth this much time, cuz issue is not major!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) [reset Function keys!]
(Phil W) [Right!]
(Leonard E.) I was just going to say that I've written code using a fair
 amount of peeks 'n pokes that *should* be compatible. And they were
 necessary too. While some people use peeks & pokes for things that can be
 easily done without them (reverse video for example). There are things that
 require them. Like my 'accounting program that stores data to disk in packed
 format (ie saves double precision numbers in 8 bytes)


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Umm, hummm, do we have that accounting program here?
  If not ?????
(Leonard E.) no, as it is of rather limited application, but if you *really*
 think it would be of use.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) We have files in DL 2 for professional uses that have limited
  use, but a lot of limited users!   Also, that sort of thing can give other
  folks an idea for revising to their purpose.
(Leonard E.) It isn't all that suited to 'professional' use. It merely
 keeps me from going crazy keeping track of bills & payments for the 'group
 housing' I inhabit. Figures shares & generates bills. Strictly single entry.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) We have HOMEXP, but not for disk use. Send your's along!
(Neil S.) You sortta beat me to my comment: Just that I'd vote to include it as
 a foundation or learning tool, if nothing else. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Right. Of course, a LOT of folks miss out on the wisdom of
  LINER1.HJB which has some fine ideas as well as ELEGNT.BAS too. In DL 4.
(Leonard E.) As for the BILLS.BA program, I can send it, but writing the docs
 will be a bitch!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, do what you can when you can.
(Leonard E.) it should work with TDD.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Anybody have any suggestions for a name for the "Forum" now
  that the term "SIG" has become unwelcome among the Chief Nibbles-in-Charge
  at CompuServe??
(Leonard E.) Huh? please elucidate.
(Neil S.) how 'bout SIGnificant M100 Forum
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Love THAT Neil!!
  The term SIG is to be replaced as rapidly as possible with the term "Forum"
  and whilst at it we may want to use a name here that is more inclusive than
  "Model 100" but NOT inclusive of 17-29 pound MS-DOS monsters.
(RICH L ) how about...The LAPTOP SHOP.....
(Denny T) How about OLYNECTAN Fourm?
(Neil S.) Tandy/Kyocera Laptop Forum is NOT a pretty name,
 but is fairly accurate for that small. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Neil, do we need the "Tandy" in there? {chwikkle, chwikkle}
  Or didn't Kyocera make the 600?
(Neil S.) I'm not certain about the 600. I mostly left that for name
 recognition. I don't think most 100/NEC/Oly owners know that their machines
 came from Kyocera, let alone Japan.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) True, most wouldn't understand "Roach Forum" either.
(Neil S.) [luv it]
(Leonard E.) I'm curious; did they say *why* the "SIG" has to go?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Of course not! Probably they have as good reasons for it as
  replacing "Sysop" with that wondrous term "Forum Administrator" !!!
(Leonard E.) [ForAd?}
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Wayne may have been given some sort of explanation, but I've
  not heard of any. That I bermember.
(Neil S.) I think that since they are against both SIG and Sysop, that it is a
 convoluted attempt to appeal to 'non-techie' types (because it's "jargon")
 but I think that it may backfire because a:  there are a lot of 'techies' and
 b: because ignoring the roots looses some of the atmosphere.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) T'is time to shut down this CO ...
  Bermember TS-RANDOM next Sunday!!
  Thankee all for participation then and now!
