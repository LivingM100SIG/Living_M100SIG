(David) Do you know if there any representatives in this from PIC (Personal
 Integrated Computer)?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) No David, I've never been aware of any representative from
  PIC showing up on the SIG at any time.
(Robby Demarco) DO YOU A PHONE NUMBER WHERE THEY SELL SELL DISK SYSTEM?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) did you want the PIC phone number for their C/PM system for
  the Model 100 Robby?
(Robby Demarco) YES
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Just a second and I'll have it ....
(David) 1-800-421-6300, robby.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Thanks David, and 714-261-0503 for PIC answers as opposed to
  merely ordering. Okay Robby??
(Robby Demarco) WELL,I WANT TO KNOW THE COST OF ONE WHOLE SALE, THERE VERY
 CHEEP.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) For wholesale price you better call the 714 number ...
  714-261-0503
(David) For any technical questions, There is a fella there by the name of
 Paul Shearer who seems to be able to answer just about anything on this topic,
 the designer's name is for the system is Luke Drew.

(Sysop .^Dave^.) David, I just noticed that PIC's latest ads say "Call us about
  date of release of .... Video Interface." Know anything about that?
(David) Talked to them about a month ago and Unfortunately, it seems as tho
 they had problems in the production of their interface as well as a second
 drive unit which is causing a delay. I have been waiting for something from
 them in the mail. they said they would let me know when they begin to market
 it.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh; maybe I'll give them a call this week to see "what is
  what" since a viable video interface is one of the pleas of many
  [at reasonable cost.]
(David) It appears to me that their advertising of these items were a bit
 premature, don't you agree?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Not really,they said "Call us about date of release" which is
  a lot better than SOME companies I know of adverising "Available NOW" stuff
  that isn't ready for months.
(David) Hmmm, guess I musta missed the "fine print"!


(Robby Demarco) DO YOU KNOW OF ANY EXTRA SPREAD SHEET MODULES. IN THIS SIG
(Sysop .^Dave^.) what do you mean? Templates? For which program? Which Computer
  and could you lower case please?
(Robby Demarco) MODULE 10module 100,and templates 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Which spreadsheet program??
(Robby Demarco) spread.ba
(Sysop .^Dave^.) suggest you check the DL 2 database for templates, there are
  some samples that Woods contributed with the program and there may be others.
  But I'm not a spreadsheeter myself, so I'm not up on them.
  See BUSNES.CAT in DL 2


(DaveW.) Tony, what was co like?
(Sysop Tony) What was Wednesday CO like?
(DaveW.) Correct.
(Sysop Tony) Well, mostkly like any CO; there's a transcript in DL8 under the
 name NITECO.061. Juist general chit-chat, getting it kicked off and getting
 folks used to the Wednesday night idea. No startling new information revealed.
 No deep philosophical questions solved. No new computers designed; but good,
 interesting interchanges.
(DaveW.) How many attended and were any of the old timers there?
(Sysop Tony) There were 22 attendees and yes, some old timers were there as
 well as new faces.  Not much different in makeup than the Sunday conference.
 But perhaps some new folks.  Some who can't get here Sunday mornings.
(DaveW.) Sounds like a fair crowd.


(DaveW.) I got a message about SPLCHK.TD2 from Fred E. to the effect that I was
 using the wrong error code detection with POWR-DISK on my No Disk and Drive
 Not Ready error checking.
(Sysop Tony) I don't recall seeing a list of error definitions in the power
 disk manual but perhaps Fred knows whereof he speaks. Also, I've not
 encountered any of the disk errors anyone has alluded to but which may be the
 result of 1) not using DCPREP before attempting to run SPLCHK, and 2) not
 having a complete set of dictionary files on the disk before running the
 program.
(DaveW.) Yes, I saw the one set of messages about not having a full set of
 dictionary files but didn't have time to respond. If dumby files are put on
 disk for the ones they haven't collected, program should run fine.
(Sysop Tony) Oh yes... I have the power-disk error codes.  Need them?
(DaveW.) Give them to me for verification purposes for what Fred left me.
(Sysop Tony) OK... I'll send you a msg right after the CO.
(DaveW.) Ok, great. How about TS-Dos?
(Sysop Tony) I'll look in the manual and see if I can find them.


(DaveW.) Tony, how long is the biggest TDD dictionary file now?
(Sysop Tony) Same size it was last week...  (grin) DIC-ST is 28,255 bytes.
(DaveW.) Already bigger than T200 can hold at one time.
(Sysop Tony) Yes... It's gotta be downloaded to disk directly.
(DaveW.) That is a Chipmunk file not a TDD file, correct?
(Sysop Tony) Yes, a Chipmunk file, and as it appears in DL5.
(DaveW.) Ok, well Chipmunk version ADDICT can handle it, however TDD files have
 to be small enough to fit in RAM.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, of course, and TDD users are bound by certain limitations to
 start off with by the drive itself.  We may need to consider another set of
 dictionary files for the TDD versions.... or even making the files available
 on disk.  They take about 2.5 hours to download, now!
(DaveW.) Wow, you've been keeping busy.
(Sysop Tony) Well... The spelling checker has been a pet project now
 for 9 months and someone else is just about to release a commercial version of
 it with ML programs, and 50,000 word "root" dictionary....
 (gnash, gnash)  ...  (teeth!)
(DaveW.) For what computers/disk drives?
(Sysop Tony) Not at liberty to discuss Company, computers, or drives, but my
 files were used to beta test their version and their dictionary is contracted
 from one used by the PC.
(DaveW.) OK, but M/L is very specific to dirve and DOS version.
(Sysop Tony) Yes it is.

(Robert Toft) .^ Dave ^.  - I've got a Q for you and all others...
  What is the difference between TS-DOS and POWR-Disk?
(Sysop Tony) Robert, saw your message on the board this AM but since you ask
 now, About $30. They also handle the main "menu" program differently but both
 come down to a "kernal" of about 2K which resides in the machine allowing you
 to access the disk from BASIC or TEXT with direct commands virtually
 identically.  In my mind, that's the most useful part of either OS.  The
 "menu" program takes up space, and is irrelevant, except to folks who want a
 program to issue the access commmands for them.


(Robert Toft) Do you think there is any interest in PASCAL for the M-100?
 I have a PASCAL (tiny) compiler written in BASIC that is about 24K long.
 If you think there would be any interest in such a creature, I'll try to get
 the P-CODE interpreter and P-CODE -> 8080 (8085) converter working.
 I've never seen the subject brought up before.
(Sysop Tony) Well, PASCAL is kinda like a lot of the "new" languages. Like
 FORTH and LOGO, it has a following of fierce, and fanatic followers (I never
 expected to see any FORTH implementation for the portables but we sure have
 one.) So there may be some interest that I wouldn't think would be out
 there. If you like it, and think it's worth having then by all means, upload
 it to the database.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Robert, we have a Tiny Basic Compiler & FORTH so why not
  Blaise Pascal too?
(DaveW.) It's my opinion that ANY compiler is of interest.
(Robert Toft) What I think is neat, alot of other don't neccessarily.  But I'll
 work on it. If it doesn't show up by 25th July, it should by XMAS.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Okay Robert sounds good, you've been a verra, verra busy l'il
 bee around here. 'Preeshee ate it!!
(DaveW.) Robert, would it be possible to keep the program size lower by having
 a data file on disk say?
(Robert Toft) Well, the way it works is by having the compiler in RAM and the
 source code and object code on an external device --- disk/cas/or even the
 keyboard for source; but the reserved words and error messages could go onto
 disk and free up about a K or 2.
(DaveW.) Ok, just a thought.


(Tom Whitworth) I just got a DVI and it came with two sys disks. One is labeled
 Model100 "DISK OPERATING SYSTEM". The other is Labeled "DISK VIDIO INTERFACE".
 What is the difference ?.
(Sysop Tony) Dunno... I only got one disk with mine labelled DISK OPERATING
 SYSTEM. have you tried listing the directory of each disk to find out what's
 on it?
(Tom Whitworth) Yes...Does the DOS disk have files for use W/the 200.?
(Sysop Tony) Yes... both versions are on the same disk.
(Tom Whitworth) Hmmm. Woder wha's up.


(larry l) just wondering how the new sig arrangement is going.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) gollee ... in what sense larry? there has been no
 "re-arrangement" of any note. Just a different sponsor.
(larry l) just mean are there any diffs I might notice.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) tee hee ...
  If you didn't notice any changes then I guess the answer is no!!
(larry l) any guest speakers in the future? 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) None currently on the slate as yet larry. Awaiting
  developments you might say.


(Robert Toft) One slight problem has arisen since I upl'd PWR200 the T-200 case
 won't close completely in the lower right corner (no biggie) but,  I can't get
 a full charge using the standard 6V supply.  I think I'll have to go with a 9V
 or so. I'll send an update on my findings. The problem is when a battery needs
 charged, the initial charge rate must be high, else it won't charge good.
 I think that's what's happening.
(Sysop Tony) Robert... pardon my asking. Are you REAL familiar with nicad
 charging.... like from an engineering standpoint, or just from an
 experimenter's view?
(Robert Toft) My experience comes from Gould TLX-39B submarine storage
 batteries.
(Sysop Tony) Well... that should suffice... I'll keep my comments to myself.


(John M) For a very brief eriod I owned the Disk Video interface but, within a
 week, traded it in for this 1000. I kept the model 100, of course, but find
 the 1000 equally, or more, useful for most desk applications.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) John, for fast file transfer between the 100 and 1000 be sure
  to see the files in DL 1 FLTIBM.DOC, FLTX.DOC and PCXFER.DES which will
  describe your options.
(John M) OK. I've tried modem transfer between the M100 and the 1000 but it's a
 tad sow at 300B. I've also tried direct RS232 transfer using COM1 on the 1000
 but with the internal modem installed on it COM1 is not available.
 I understand that there is trouble sith COM2 as far as software is concerned.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm, not familiar with the modem board so I can't say.
  Ask over on TAndy PRO for help if needed; most folks get external modem for
  the 1000 with an RS-232 board as part of a multi-function board.
(John M) OK. Speaking of Modem. Have you, or anyone during conference,
 discussed the 1200 external modem for the 100?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Some have used it and Tony has a file bout that in DL 1
  methinks. You need to turn OFF the screen for effective use of the 100 at
  1200 baud and use it only for XMODEM transfers else a waste of money.
(John M) Thanks, I didn't know that. So far, I have not developed a strong need
 for 1200 baud for the M100.  When I use it for travel, I use acoustic couler
 and find that the 300 baud internal modem is quite adequate.  Of course,
 having XModem transfer capabilities would be a definite plus.  The 1000
 satisfies my 1200 baud requirements at the desk.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Er, John there is XMODEM.312 for the Model 100 in the DL 1
 database for use at 300 baud with internal modem or 1200 with external.
(John M) Whops. That shows you how familiar I am with the data base libraries
 here. Obviously I need to do a bit more exploring.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Start with CATLOG.CAT in DL 9 and work your way back.
