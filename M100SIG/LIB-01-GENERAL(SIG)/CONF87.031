
(ROBI) you there tony?

(Sysop Tony) Good Morning.
  Hi there, Robi.  Guten day, or whatever. (grin)

(ROBI) evening, friend.

(Sysop Tony) Oh, yes... it's evening, there.

(ROBI) Guy, Jim & Ken are here with me helping me waste my money.

(Sysop Tony) I don't think I know them by first name.  But boy, are you
  spending the bucks!

(ROBI) or last name or by number

(Sysop Tony) (Hi guys)

(ROBI) I left a msg for the guy that asked about hitting CIS from over here

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I saw that, and gave you a quick "hi".

(ROBI) I was hiding in a DL.  I also left one avout invisi.  we are starting
to get attendees now so I guess you had better take charge.

(Sysop Tony) OK... nice chatting with you again.

(Bob S.)  Anyone had a chance to use the the Sardine from TSI?

(Sysop Tony) Bob... It only started shippin last week, and preliminary
  reports are mainly from Beta testers.

(Bob S.) Okay. That tells me two things - that they are shipping and the source
  of the comments I've heard. thnxs.

(Sysop Tony) Have you seen Denny's file SARDIN.REV in DL13?

(Bob S.) yeah. Found it interesting, but wondered about how he got the program
  so quick

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Any questions you want to ask Denny direct?

(Bob S.) Not now. Thanks.

(Sysop Tony) OK,  Then Peter is up next.  GA Peter

(PETER JABLOW) I have a question about the merge function on UR-2?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, what is it?

(PETER JABLOW) I can't get it to work per the documentation.  After I enter
  f1 it goes to the print menu and doesn't prompt for the merge.

(Denny T) Peter, do you have the appropriate CTRL char. in the file? ^Q
  usually

(PETER JABLOW) yes, I have it in the main menu.  I want to merge in a data
  file.

(Denny T) Ah, you have to imbed a ^Q in the file that you select first in the
  T-word menu.

(PETER JABLOW) I have the ^Q in the main file

(Sysop Tony) Peter, I assume you have read the manual on this, section 7.  And
  selected BOTH files in the file selection screen?

(PETER JABLOW) When I enter tword and hit enter over the main file
  it is supposed to prompt for the merged file but I don't get that prompt.

(Sysop Tony) Then you have an error there.  It is supposed to send the prompt.

(PETER JABLOW) Could that be a problem with the rom?

(Sysop Tony) It could be, but it's more likely pilot error.

(Denny T) Ok, If you are using a data file, do you use the form ^Q1 ^Q2, etc.

(Sysop Tony) Read section 7 again, very carefully.

(PETER JABLOW) I will check it again. Thanks for the help.

(Denny T) the form for using merges is very specific and if not exact,
  will not work at all.  I had to go through a learning curve on it also.

(PETER JABLOW) I assume then I will not get the merge prompt unless the files
  are correct?

(Sysop Tony) I wouldn't assume that.

(PETER JABLOW) no more questions from me now. thnaks

(Gerald G) Where are Ultimate programs sold?

(Sysop Tony) Ultimate ROM-2 is sold by Traveling Software, Inc. in Bothell,
  Washington.  You can review many of their product descriptions, and get
  their ordering information and address in files in DL13.  They are very good
about leaving descriptive files.

(Sysop Tony) Gerald... you can also buy Ultimate ROM-2 from Radio Shack
  Computer Centers through the express ordering service, but at full list
  price.

(Gerald G) thank you.

(Ronnie R.) I am getting the Tword with the SARDINE prog.  Do any of you know
  if it supports proportional justify.

(Denny T) T-word in any form probably will never support proportional
  it is so printer specific, that there would have to be a special file that
  gave the specs for each printer you use.  But I'd also like to see
  something like that happen.

(PETER JABLOW) Doesnt the config file support proportinial?

(Sysop Tony) N, but T-Word does support Left-Right justify

(Denny T) You can set the printer to activate proportional, but it will not
  right justify it.

(Ronnie R.) The requirement would be for a spec file with a data table of the
  printer widths. This is easy to do in basic but ssssslow.

(PETER JABLOW) thnks

(Denny T) [exactly]

(Sysop Tony)  OK. any more on justification?  Can we justify this? (arghghgh)

(Marty T) [leave the puns to Sysop Dave]

(Sysop Tony) (Marty... you're not up to date!)

(Gerald G) Can you give me a keyword for "T word" for the dl?

(Sysop Tony) Yes... "ROM"

(Gerald G) thank you.

(Sysop Tony) ok  Robi is next, from Germany.... ga Robi

(ROBI)  Have to go and wanted to wish everyone well from this
  side of the puddle.

(Sysop Tony) OK... thanks for joining us - even at $50 an hour!  See you again.
  On to Curtis....  ga Curtis

(Curtis G) I am having problems with the RECV program in DL-4 I think
  can some one help me?

(Sysop Tony) Well, I've used the program, but of course, can't refer to
  it now.  But what problems are you having?

(Curtis G) I get an end of file message I think in line 180

(Sysop Tony) Probably because you've reached the end of the file.
  Have you looked at the file?

(Curtis G) It never obtains any information from the other model-100

(Sysop Tony) Leave me a note on the message board to remind me, and I'll check
  the program today and get back to you.  OK?

(Curtis G) Thanks Tony

(Sysop Tony) OK.... On to Ronnie.  ga Ronnie

(Ronnie R.) Hi. Has HAs anyone got the SARDINE prog???

(Sysop Tony) Ronnie, They only started shipping this last week
  but we have one of the prime beta testers here,
  So what questions did you have?

(Ronnie R.) I was wondering if the checker was interactive with the text
  prog.

(Denny T) yes, very much so. you go into text, and if you want to check a word
  just put the cursor on the last char. of the word and hit <GRPH>+<w>
  it will then check that word, or portion of a word, and then go back to text.

(Sysop Tony) Curious... why on the last character?

(Denny T) I guess it's used as a delimiter. it checks from the last space to
  the cursor.  makes it very handy to check portions of a word.

(Ronnie R.) Thanks. You guys have been a big help in my deciding what to get
  for a book project. Write ROM just does not stack up well enough.
  THanks again.

(Sysop Tony) It looks like SARDINE + the UR-2 is going to be the big jump
  forward  this year.

(Denny T) Yes, If you write for a living...  there is no better system
  than a TDD and Sardine.  I have Write ROM and like you say, it just doesn't
  stack up
  BTW, Sardine has the TEXT enhancements from UR-2, like Search and Replace

(Sysop Tony) Now if we could just work out this multiple-ROM problem

(Ronnie R.) Xplain UR2 text enhancement Denny

(Denny T) Like I said, Search and Replace, word/byte/line display
  and overwrite mode

(Sysop Tony) Any more on that, Ronnie?

(Ronnie R.) Nope. Now I can't wait to get it.

(Sysop Tony) Looks like a good choice.

(Sysop Tony) Well, barring a change of mind!  (grin)
  OK... back to the conference.  If no questions, we're gonna stop.
  Come one, guys... let's hear it.  Send a "Q" to ask a question or change
  topic, send a "C" to comment on the current topic.

(Sysop Tony) OK... I guess everyone is having no problems...

(Denny T) I have a final comment on Sardine, to quell any of the "Vaporware"
 /tim
 comments - the program was first working in July of last year
  and was sent to the beta testers in October.  it has been a very heavy beta
  testing session.  we have asked for tons of improvements over the original
  and TS came through with 99% of them.  So, I think everyone is going to
  really be able to use this ROM to it's fullest extent WITHOUT a lot of
  version changes due to bugs. There just won't have to be further versions
  unless something new is added.

(Sysop Tony) Traveling Software really seems to have their act together on
  software.  and the company has been very responsive to the user base.
  Unfortunately, they are not on the forum message board as often as
  they used to be, but they do receive and respond to Email.
  Messages left here, or in EasyPlex, go direct to Mark Eppley, the
  company president.

(R Caley) ok  I live in Seattle and I agree.  They are one of the most
  user responsive groups around.

  Saw an ad in different mags from a company called NODE I believe.
  do they have 256K expansions for the M100 as well as 102?

(Sysop Tony) Yep!  They have a new gimmick out called a RAM Disk... with
  either 128 or 256 K that plugs into the system buss, and gives you a
  humongous file storage area.  It's like having an online disk.
  But, it appears files still have to be brought into RAM
  to be worked on, and are limited to whatever size your RAM space is.
  However, Mel Snyder, who got one of the first ones, is daily discovering
  new ways to work with it.  Check some of his current messages on the
  subject with the command RS;S;NODE;0

(Denny T) [T200 also]

(Sysop Tony) Yes, it's available for all 3 machines.

(R Caley) Seems like they should be able to overcome the "in ram" business
  pcsg claims theirs can hold an ADRS.DO in parts of different banks and the
  program will access the entire file no matter where it is stored...

(Sysop Tony) Well, each company develops their own technique.

('FRIEL) wondering if anyone might be able to give me advice
  sometimes parts of my keyboard are 'disabled' the letters affected are
  L and the entire bottom row of letters.  what have i done to my M100?

(Sysop Tony) Sounds like you have a defective or damaged keyboard.
  Have you spilled anything into it?  Or do you let the cat lay on it?
  (Hi Denny!)
  Or have you just pounded it to death?

('FRIEL) no spills or cats, i keep it covered when not in use...but i have
  put about 100,000 miles on the board.  what do i do now?

(Sysop Tony) Well...

(Denny T) [cats = no problem]

(Sysop Tony) we have had a couple of reports of keyboards pooping out
  after two or three years, depending on use.  If you can replace it yourself,
you can buy a new keyboard through
  Radio Shack's National Parts.  Or, check the file PARTS1.100 in DL13 for
  another source.  Or take it in for repair.  They replace, rather than
  repair, and it seems I recall it costs about $135.

('FRIEL) thanks for the good advise, i like the conf, and have used the dl's
  extensively.  thats all for me right now

(Sysop Tony) OK... Good luck.
  Anyone have any questions, or a topic they want to discuss?
  How about the new "Chat" section on the message board?  Whatcha think of
  that?

(Denny T) I like the idea, 1 vote

(Sysop Tony) Well, Wayne asked for response, and so far he's received about
  10 messages firmly in favor of it. looks like it will become a reality this
  week. (or sooner)

('FRIEL) can you give me a quick how to on finding the chat section.

(Sysop Tony) Ah! ... It hasn't been activated yet. when it is, it'll
  probably be section 17, and you can read it or leave messages, just like any
  other section.  Or you can set your option menu to ignore it completely.

('FRIEL) thanks

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm  Let me ask this:
  What sort of programs or files seem to be the most useful to you folks?

('FRIEL) I'd have to say that utilities are by far the most often down loaded
 by self..

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh.  What utilities do you use, mostly?

('FRIEL) things like CALC...LISTER...SETRAM...SORT...TDDTIP...RENUM...

(Sysop Tony) Yeah.  I've found the SORT.LDR program, in both 100 and 200
  versions to be most useful.

(Curtis G) My favorites are the CA help files and the model spread sheets

(Sysop Tony) Then you must do a lot of spreadsheet work.  Have you found the
  new catalog file SSHEET.CAT of use?  and which SS program do you use?

(Curtis G) How new is it I havent been around for three weeks?

(Sysop Tony) Well, Eiji updates them all the time, but it's been in DL4 for
  a couple of months, at least.

(Curtis G) I like the personal accounting and the tax programs

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh.  OK... any more comments on useful programs?

(Wayne) Morning (he says, with a sheepish smile on his face)

(Sysop Tony) Why sheepish?

(Wayne) Well, I HAD planned on being here about 2 hours earlier, but
  the best laid plans, etc.

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh.  Reminds me of the line about Argentina, where the gauchos
  are real men, and the sheep are nervous.  But then this CO seems to be
  winding down.  Wayne, we've had some positive response here this morning to
  the Chat section.  When is it going to be activated?

(Wayne) Well, seeing as there really haven't been any negative reactions
  I think we can turn it on this afternoon sometime.

(Sysop Tony) Great!  I can think of several things I want to say, right away!
  (grin)

(BILL BEELER) Has anyone ever thought of ususing a CTON command incorporated
  with a multi rom bank/multi ram bank, to have a different rom for each bank?

(Sysop Tony) Bill, I can't make a connection with "CTON".... clarify?
  There is a 6-ROM bank available.

(BILL BEELER) MOTOR ON

(Sysop Tony) Each ROM is switch selected.

(Denny T) Well, If you install a rom in a bank it will only be active in that
  bank, but you want to switch banks banks automatically, I take it?

(BILL BEELER) Yes

(Denny T) that would requre a relay and a mod to the current 6 ROM bank that's
  available The problem would be moding the bankswitching program.
  You would need something that would switch 6 times.  the Cassette port
  could activate this one-of-6 switcher relay.

(BILL BEELER) The relay is incorporated into the M100 cassette interface...
  Would need to hook..
  If a type of switch, non selective, could be instituted into the ROM BANK
  and then use each bank for different ROM, incorporating function key
  switching. it would switch to a different ROM in each BANK, yes?

(Sysop Tony) Looks like that would be a major hardware modification.
  Denny?

(Denny T) It could be done, but there is one major flaw in the scheme
  You MUST turn off the computer to change ROMs.  the machine will cold
  start if you don't

(BILL BEELER) Even with the 6 BANK ROM?

(Denny T) That's the one I'm talking about, I have one

(BILL BEELER) Ok!, back to the drawing board!!

(Denny T) Good Idea, though.

(Sysop Tony) Denny, suppose we'd better comment that you can't piggy-back ROM's
  and switch via the power supply line, or the select line.  Right?

(Denny T) I do know there is a lot of circutry involved in the 6 ROM bank to do
  the switching.

(Sysop Tony) Well, as I understood it, the PCSG 6-ROM bank, has 6 or 7 IC's to
  do the switching, and Mike once commented that you can't select without them.
  (without a humongous switch!)

(Denny T) Right

(Sysop Tony) OK.  Well, folks, we're down to the last 15 minutes or so
  any pressing questions before we close up this week's CO?

(Nick) I have to control four motors for a project i'm working on, any helps?

(Sysop Tony) If you mean turn them on or off from the computer then it can be
  done using the printer port.  Is that what you mean?

(Nick) yes , that's it

(Sysop Tony) OK... see the file PORTS.USE in DL7 or 8.  It's a new file by James
  Yi, and has a good amount of control info.  OK?

(Nick) Thanks!

(Sysop Tony) Ok.... Any others?

(BILL BEELER) Have seen what is called an A-BUS ad in micro 80, that will
  control motors but is $$$$

(Sysop Tony) I haven't seen the ad... (don't get micro-80) but most external
  controllers cost big bucks.  there have been a half dozen or so advertised
  over the years, and the cheapest was about $200, and the most expensive,
  about $1000.  We had a near genius here at one time, Peter St. Clair, who
  is now active on the Atari forum, who had all sorts of control gadgets
  working from his Model 100, but never got around to writing files describing
  how to do all that good stuff.

(Denny T) Excel company sells a complete system including M100 and printer and
  Haliburton case for almost $4000!

(Sysop Tony) Wow!

(Nick) This project is for controlling three robots on stage which interact
  with a live actor.  it's strictly looww budjet!

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh. Gary Davis, one of our members has one of the Zenith/Heath
  robots, which he programs with a Model 100.

(Nick) Don't laugh! The robots are only pan and tilt uni/tim
ts from video camera
  mountings, right now.  I am using touch tones on a tape.

(Sysop Tony) No, I didn't mean to imply laughter... remote control is a very
  good use for a Model 100. (I wish we had more info on it!)

(Nick) I'll check the DL. Thanks

(Sysop Tony) OK  Time for one more question, I think
  Who?

  OK.  None?

  OK.  Then I guess it's time to call a halt to this AM's CO.
  Thanks for coming and participating.  We appreciate your feedback.
  *** END OF CO ***
