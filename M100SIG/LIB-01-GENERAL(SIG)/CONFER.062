(Michelle Ferry) I just did a dumb thing and lost a file,
 any way to get it back?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Only if you haven't used your computer since.
  It is in RAM you mean?? or on disk?
(Michelle Ferry) Is in RAM and its a text file. Can I peek em out?
(Sysop Tony) It's only recoverable if it was the last file you had in memory
 cause otherwise, when it was deleted, the rest of the files moved down
 to fill up the empty space.
(Michelle Ferry) It is the last one
(Sysop Tony) However, the program that will (maybe) recover lost files is
 called CSFIX in DL4.  
(John R) But, if you download CSFIX that process will wipe out the file anyway!
(Sysop Tony) Yes, John is right. Don't download the file... read it, Echo it to
 paper, then use it in direct mode in BASIC.
(Michelle Ferry) Ok you mean type it in?
(Sysop Tony) Echo a copy to your printer, then sign off, go into BASIC, and
 type the program... it's only 4 lines and then type RUN.  Should do the work.
(Michelle Ferry) Great! thanks!!!!
(Sysop Tony) You'll end up with one large file, probably called "SAV.DO" or
 something Which you can edit the original file out of by deleting any
 unneccessary material.


(JOHN G) dave have you heard any info on model 102 ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) For the official announcement GO TRS-365. We have heard that
  the standard bugs still exist that the buss is now in the back by the printer
  interface and that all (probably) Model 100 software is compatible. You can
  get more info on the 102 by use of the command ...
  RS;S;102;0
  on the message board.
(JOHN G) I was going to say that NEC has a new machine in the works also!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Is it similar to 8201 or to the Starlet?? Big diff!!
(JOHN G) ter to the model 102, I think.


(Ross_R) My Q regards the Ultimate ROM II for the Model 200. Does it have
 T-View 80 giving a 16 by 60-80 screen ?
(Sysop Tony) the Tandy 200 version does not have T-View 80.  Instead, they
 provide you with a copy of TS-DOS at no charge.  Something to do with the
 amount of RAM space used by T-VIEW, as I recall.


(Steve C) The Model 200 will give you your file sizes directly. Is there any
 program to do the same for your files on the 100? I'm looking for a way to
 check the length of my text files.
(Sysop Tony) Not on the Menu screen as the Tandy 200 does. But there are
 several programs that will give you file sizes, including FILEN.100 in DL4.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Steve, as you move on in the 100 world to other software,
  you'll find that most of the ROM and hardware extensions such as Chipmunk and
  RAM boards have all that built in. A lot of commercial software too.
  For finding out a lot about your 100 capability, RFU.BA is fun and very
  practical. In DL 4 database with all utility type programs.
  A LOT of goodies there!!


(John M) I just received a promo from PCSG advertising many price reductions.
 the Chipmunk has been reduced.
 Is this the same unit as the original $599 version?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes it is John, except that the ROM is better. Not sure about
  software bundling but I 'spect that the main reason for the price drop is
  reaction to arrival of Tandy's disk drive as the Chipmunk was no longer the
  only frog in the pond.
(Sysop Tony) The latest version of the Chipmunk ROM is 3.45 and the bundled
 software is version 1.4. Available for $399 from PCSG, or for $299 direct from
 Holmes Engineering without the bundled software.
(PhilW) I have a new 'munk. the software is nice, but still buggy.  The
 TELCOM.CO program has some real problems!  I'd consider the 299 Holmes deal
 with use of SIG software.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) methinks that all folks agree that TELCOM extension of PCSG's
  is a lionsastrophe; that is a very big catastrophe ...
(Jay M.) [boo!]
(Mark H) (groan)
(PhilW) [Dave-Speak!]
(Sysop .^Dave^.) I use XMODEM.312 or X-TEL or TERM.MR1 rather than that thing.
(Sysop Tony) Well, in defense of PCSG's TELCOM.CO, I've used it without
 problems, but only as a single function program. In other words, if you want
 to download a file do nothing but downloading.  Then turn the program off, and
 back on for other functions.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Tony is better organized and keeps track of what he is doing
  at a given secend better than I.
(PhilW) I've not yet been able to dow to ram with it. Cold start each time
 while on line and I tend to forget the '0:'!!
(Sysop Tony) Well, there's the problem, Phil. The program wasn't designed for
 downloading to RAM and it barfs.  Downloading to disk works fine, as long as
 that's the only function you use it for, and providing you CLEAR256,MAXRAM
 before loading, so there is no residual ML code in the area TELCOM.CO wants to
 use for a buffer.
(PhilW) but then it should force the 0:
(Sysop Tony) I can't disagree with that.



(Sysop .^Dave^.) So let me say this about the Tandy departure though Michelle
  has left. Not being the president of Tandy, I can only refer folks to message
  #120875 for their departure message and also suggest GO TRS-365 for Ed Juge's
  comments in the Tandy newsletter. Wayne Day, aka Golden Triangle Corp.,
  will be guest on the CO next week and you can work him over for the REAL
  scoop if you wish at that time, though I suspect he'll say the same as I.


(RICH L) Is the Chipmunk popular or does it just have alot of problems?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Hmmmm,,,,, Interesting phraseology there and I bet nobody is
  going to say YES or NO. T'is popular and very good though it took a while to
  debug it is a far, far better tool than any other portable option.
  but is not a Tandy 6000 either.
(PhilW) I've had one for 2 weeks and NO problems.  Have put it thru all kinds
 of tests and the main thing I don't like is the software. In fact the only
 thing.  Would have been more popular early, but it was priced too high.
 Else the TDD would have been very less popular.
(Rob D) Our company has multiple Chipmunks all purchased about one year ago;
 all have gone in for repair after 10-12 months with an average repair cost of
 $58 each (US).  They are a very remarkable product but not infallible.
(Sysop Tony) Rich, the Chipmunk is VERY popular among serious disk users and
 the recent price reductions make it even more attractive. it does things the
 TDD will never be able to do.  But PCSG's bundled software is another tale.
 It's the software that's the problem, not the Chipmunk.
 it's still undergoing debugging.
(RICH L) I asked is that I have been to every 100 meeting here in Atlanta,
  with some 126 diff. users and have not seen a Chipmunk as yet.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Interesting! Maybe Mortimer and Eutie and I should come
  visit!!
(PhilW) Re the software the operating system software is now very solid,
 but the applications (bundled) softwrae continues to be aproblem.
(Sysop Tony) The TDD is probably more popular as far as numbers go,
 probably 20 to 1, probably due to price, and you wonder how many folks do not
 know what they're NOT getting. But Radio Shack has almost 7000 outlets,
 whereas the Chipmunk has had only 2 the sales ratio is bound to be lopsided.
(Jay Maynard) there are a lot of ham radio users of the 100 here in Houston,
 and we've never seen a 'mink either! there are, though, quite a few TDDs
 including mine. ...uhm...munk.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Interesting. Houston and Atlanta in the same trip would be
  rugged!!
(Jay Maynard) [haw!]
(John R) Is the 'mink a deluxe model of the 'munk?
(RICH L) hahahah
(Mark H) (groan)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yuk! 
(Jay Maynard) [rolling on floor]


(Gerald G) It is agreed that the Chipmunk's software is bundled and the TDD is
 slow. I am presently using a tape drive that loads in sequential order.
 Is the Tandy drive trouble free since a ram drive would be a lot faster,
 however slow then a tape drive. 
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Trouble free??  har de har har
(Sysop Tony) The TDD has some limitations; principally, sequential only access
 to files and only one file can be opened at a time. The Chipmunk allows random
 access from anywhere within a file and you can open more than one disk file at
 a time. That point along makes it a better drive. But I am not aware that any
 "Ram Disk" exists in the sense you imply except in a burned EPROM, which
 cannot be written to....
(PhilW) [Bubble?]
(Sysop Tony) and perhaps SoundSight's Bubble memory package which is VERY
expensive.  What exactly is your application?
(Gerald G) Let me elaborate on what I mean. If I have five progams on a tape or
 preferably disk what you are telling me that I have to go through all five 
 programs in order to get to the last (fifth) one that I want.  That is what
 the tape drive is doing and obviously the TDD is not much of a improvement,
 except it runs faster. Am I correct?
(Sysop Tony) OK, Gerald... we need to clarify terms here. There are "programs"
 and "files"... they are different sorts of data. All the disk drives "load" or
 "save" programs instantly!  You do not "read" through anything to get to them.
 "Loading from the TDD disk" is roughly ten times as fast as loading from
 cassette.
(Gerald G) Then from what you tell me I can access the progams on a TDD
 instantly, and not in the sequential order that I listed them. Correct?
(Sysop Tony) Yes, that is correct. 
(DaveW.) I saw a mention of a "RAM Disk". I have seen an ad for one...
 but I can't remember where. 
(Sysop Tony) (Portable 100.  It's a burned EPROM)


(Jay M.) Acroatix published a newsletter recently; in it, they mentioned a call
 that would format a disk with POWR-DISK installed. I've lost the letter;
 anyone remember the call?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Don't know about that but we DO have a stand alone formatting
  utility in DL 5 that you may wish to investigate.
  Name of FORMAT.* or some such.
(Sysop Tony) CALL MAXRAM+15,6


(Tom Whitworth) I have a  Model 1 monitor can I use this with the dvi ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Ummmm ... where are our DVI experts ...
(Sysop Tony) Tom... if it has a standard video input. Yes.  You can also use a
 TV set on channel 3 or 4, the modulator is built in.
 (BTW Dave... I have a DVI)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Well, well! That gnu Tony?
(Sysop Tony) Well.... I've had it for 48 hours or so for program development.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Uh huh! Didn't think I was that out of touch ...
(Sysop Tony) (Well you've been away....)
(Tom Whitworth) I understand that with a TV you get only 8X40.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) And a lousy picture.
(Sysop Tony) I don't know about the 8 by, but the 40 is usual on TV sets,
 since the set doesn't have the bandwidth to handle 80 characters.
 I don't care for the 80 character display on a real monitor, either.
 the letters are very, very narrow!
(RICH L) it's 16 x 40 on a t.v.
(Sysop Tony) (and 25 x 80 on a monitor)
(Tom Whitworth) I thought I read 8X40 and 16X40 I guess IM mistaken.
 are you saying Im better off with a TDD ?
(DaveW.) I thought it was 25x40 on T.V. as the only command used
 to change to a monitor is the width.
(RICH L) the D/VI is a real sleeper in the power dept....it's well worth it.
 I've used one to run a 100 bbs since 84'
(Sysop Tony) Tom, unless you want/need a video display, you are definitely
 better off with a TDD.


(Jim K) i've go the ultimate Rom of TS and the powr-d and tmpc of acroatix,
 and although the tmpc is relocated i've noticed conflict with the ultimate
 rom. i also have pgsg's 128k upgrade. anyone familiary with what my problems
 is....
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Number one suggestion is to collect FLIPML.100 and FLIPML.DOC
  from the DL 4 database.
(PhilW) Several things on this. oNe is that TMPC will not relocate, so far as I
 know. another is that FLIPML is not so good for tmpc due to size; best use
 FUTIL that comes with tmpc.  And the conflict is what??? Note that VIEW will
 not load with any other m/l program in high RAM; needs the same space.
 =Finally, best not to run programs from within UR-2.
(Jim K) yes it was VIEW. also no global search and replace and no multiple
 copies in the WP module; and more comments?
(PhilW) the lack of global search/replace is new.  You mean while inside UR-2
 using Text?
(Jim K) yes.
(PhilW) Hmmmmmm no answers for that one. best call TS
(Sysop .^Dave^.) let me suggest that you leave a message on the board here for
  Traveling at User Id 76466,15  Or telephone of course.


(PhilW) On that last topic, having lots of add-ons and using them all at once
 is not always such a good idea!  Now a question for Tony (ynoT):
 How do the DVI and the Chipmunk compare re speed, software interface,
 Basic, etc?  Can you use the bundled Chipmunk s/w woth the DVI, etc?
(Sysop Tony) Phil, I haven't got into it's use that far, yet... give me a few
 days. There are a lot of things I want to try including seeing what Chipmunk
 stuff is usable directly. But first, gotta read the manual!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) WHAT!!
(PhilW) How big is the DVI disK?
(Sysop Tony) 5.25 inches.
(PhilW) Bytes!
(Sysop Tony) 184K +/- a byte or so.
(PhilW) Ohhh... Smaller by x2!


(LARRY R.) First, &mike& said I should pass on the info that RENUM.100(?) has
 some kind of glitch in it as it failed to properly change all numbers in a
 modified version of TYPO3.MAL I was working with.  Also, I am using a standard
 issue 1 each Global Search & Replace program from RS.  Is there a faster one
 in DL that would also allow you to replace back into same .DO? Current one you
 need to create a new .DO to receive the changed info.
(Sysop .^Dave^.) see SCHRP2.100 in the DL 4 database; no guarantee about it's
  speed but just about anything would be better than the RS stuff; assume yours
  is from the 12 program cassette.  As to RENUM; it won't handle ELSE
  statements reliably methinks but I believe that TOOLKT.PMS is very reliable,
  but if you intend to stick with programming the 100 let me recommend
  RENUM.PRD and BYFYTE.PRD in the DL 6 database.
(Sysop Tony) I've used the Search/Replace program from our DL and it's very
 good, allowing you to change more than one word/phrase at a time. it will do
 several changes simulataneously.
(LARRY R.) Will it allow you to put results back into same .DO instead of
 having to create new .DO ?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) One .DO as I remember.
(PhilW) The RY stuff in DL4 is also good:
 RESEQ.RY & CRUSHR.RY are two -- small & fast!
(Sysop .^Dave^.) REPLAC.RY would be the one that Larry would want then,
  suggest you get them and experiment Larry.


(PhilW) does anyone understand the Tandy sales strategy of offering the M102
 at $499 with 24K and then selling an 8k add-in at $15?
(Sysop Tony) (I doubt it!)
(PhilW) doesn't seem to be worth the trouble.  Why not 32K out of the box?
(Paul S) (nope)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Lets pass on psycoanalysis with only 5 minutes to go.
  Okay?? Phil?? Good!!
(PhilW) OK! 


(LARRY R.) I am considering going from INTERACTIVE SOLUTIONS to WRITE.ROM for
 my word processing needs, as I find I don't use the spreadsheet at all
 and Data Manager has this bug about freezing up my machine when I use
 print report or call to the point that I am now using ADRS.DO and NOTE.DO
 for data keeping.  That leaves only word processing.  Write.rom seems to
 be better program (more bells & whistles)
 Is there anything I need to know (caveats) about this proposed switchover?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Larry, if you're not a spread sheeter, investigate Ultimate
  ROM II as the penultimate solution; but let me assure you that WRITE.ROM is
  fine ...
(Sysop Tony) (groan!)
(Sysop .^Dave^.) see WRIROM.REV in the DL 6 database ...
(PhilW) T-Word is far nicer than WRITE ROM.  But I prefer Super ROM to UR-2
 due to Lucid and particularly Thought. So it is a hard choice.
(LARRY R.) who makes UR2?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Traveling Software; see the products described in DL 6 under
  TS??? filename
(LARRY R.) I missed filename in DL6?
(Sysop .^Dave^.) use the command BRO TS????
  to get their descriptions.
(LARRY R.) BRO TS???? with all 4 ?'s
(Sysop .^Dave^.) Yes!!! 



(DaveW.) Tony, what does an EPROM have to do with a RAM Disk?
(Sysop Tony) "RAM disk" is how Marty Goodman and John Ross decided to describe
 the process of burning programs and data files into EPROM's in their
 commercial service which is similar to Polar Engineering's ROM burning
 service, GUARDIAN.
(DaveW.) OK, but a RAM Disk is a disk emulator using RAM storage and SoundSights Bubble can be set up as 512K of disk equivalent.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, true...  but still that's what Goodman and Ross decided to
 call it.


(Sysop .^Dave^.) Closing conference ...
Many thanks for coming to you all ...
All go to yak-yak mode ...
