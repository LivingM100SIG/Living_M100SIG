(David H. Hawes) dave sommer, are you there

(David Sommer) im here, hello all

(David H. Hawes) ok, Im

(David Sommer) I'm here in Albuquerque, NM

(Sysop Tony) Well, good evening, David Hawes in Charleston SC.  And good
  evening to you, David Sommer in Aluguerque .

(gene) ok

(Sysop Tony) Boy, that's hard to spell.!

(gene) B-O-Y

(David Sommer) (it took me a couple of years to get it right

(Sysop Tony) No, Alguquerque.

(gene) ok!

(Sysop Tony) Whatever.

(David Sommer) [Albuquerque]

(Sysop Tony) Well, open topics tonight.  Anyone have a question to start us
  off?

(David H. Hawes) Tony, is there a sysop in Richmond, VA

(Sysop Tony) Undoubtedly so, David.  But not one from this forum.

(David H. Hawes) I saw a license plate CIS-SYsoP

(Sysop Tony) Well, maybe he's a Sysop on another forum.  There are over 200 of
  them, you know. 

(John A) DOES DSKMGR WORK WITH DV/I?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, a relocatable version of it does.  NFER.HLP

(John A) Would that be DSKMGR.REL in DL9?

(Sysop Tony) Probably so.  I'm not sure of the name.  hange topic;
  Hmmm... I'm having some trouble with my macros tonight.

(John A) I'LL HAVE TO RE UPLOAD IT THANKS

(gene) [Tony, I think you're having prob w/macro]

(David Sommer) ( a Mac attack?)

(Sysop Tony) Yep, a Mac attack. (grin)

(David Sommer) ok  this split screen is great!!!  this is the 1st chance I've
  really ...

(Phil) [Attack of the Killer Macros]

(David Sommer) had to use it.  Sure helps  with all these multiplexed
  phrases.

(Sysop Tony) Yes, it sure does.  Phil was active in creating that for us.
  Ah!  My program got mangled.  Got it back now.  Any more David?

(David Sommer) Nope ga

(GERALD FLANAGAN) I am new to this forum can you tell me how it works?

(Sysop Tony) Yes, What you type is seen by everybody.  When I call on you,
  it's your turn.  When others are speaking, it's their turn.  Read the file
  CONFER.HLP in DL1 as soon as you can.

(GERALD FLANAGAN) what does ga mean? thanks, I'm going there now.  see you
  later.

(Sysop Tony) Your turn again, Gerald.  ga = go ahead.  OK... open topic time.
  Who has a question?

(gene) Why do I have to use G PCS 154 when others use G MOD100 SIG?

(Sysop Tony) You don't... what they can do, you can do.  However, the proper
  form is two words, GO M100SI You only need to use PCS154 if you come here
  from the PER area.

(gene) ok thanx done

(David Sommer) ok  oh..i've used go m100sig from per  anyway  are there any
  plans to add CAS and/or TDD access to XMDPW5?..

(Sysop Tony) Probably not.  Phil?

(Phil) Well, I've given it some thought.  The code is now at about 4100 bytes
  likely would get to 5K or so to add the device stuff  if TDD is added, it
  will assume use of an OS supporting 0:.

(Sysop Tony) Except that  you can't use the TDD while also using the modem.

(Phil) Yes  but it would work with the munk that way.  [hows that for quick
  thinking????]

(Sysop Tony) It's not likely we'll see download to disk capability with the
  TDD the way the ROM in the computer, and the TDD are structured.  Several
  folks have tried, and not been able to get it to work.

(gene) re: d/load to CAS  You can enter text (after d/load  & then SAVE"xxxxx
  & then enter BASIC & kill file to make more room for next d/l with  scrool
  on & off commands.

(Sysop Tony) It is not possible to download direct to the TDD disk. The
  computer has only one communications chip, and when it is being used for
  the modem, it cannot also connect to the RS-232 port, where the disk drive
  is connected. You can only _truly_ download to disk with a drive that is
  buss connected, like the Chipmunk or D/VI. You can, however "simulate"
  downloading to disk in a couple of ways. If you have an external modem,
  install a switch at the RS-232 port, and download a file into RAM, flip the
  switch, and save it to the disk. Then kill the file in RAM, switch back to
  the modem, and do it again. For other approaches see the 3 DSKTRM files in
  DL3, several DPUSER and DPTIP files in DL9 and I also recommend the TDDTIP
  series of files in DL9 (TD2TIP if you have the new TDD-2).

(Phil) [Macro Mania]

(Sysop Tony) Any more on this, David?

(gene) Agree, only way is - to CAS

(David Sommer) mmmmm...

(Sysop Tony) Before disk drives became available  it was common to download
  40 or 50K to a cassette, using one of the BASIC Xmodem programs, which
  support that.  But XMDPW5 is all...

(Roger K) Hi

(Sysop Tony) machine language, and doesn't support external or addressed
  devices. Any more on that, David?

(David Sommer) some...  I not only have XMDPW5 but also
  XMODEM.312 whicH i use for those  LONG file (to CAS)  I'll look at those
  other Ideas one of these days.  when you say CAN'T...I smell a
  challenge...and may tackle that some day when I've run out of things  to do.

(Sysop Tony) No one has been able to do it, and believe me, some talented
  people have already tried.

(Phil) David, I think use of xmdpw5 with exit to text as Gene suggests  will be
  faster than xmodem.312, at anyspeed above 300 baud.  The Basic ...

(David Sommer) yes thats a good idea.

(Phil) xmodem programs are really slow and cost you a BIG speed penalty.

(Sysop Tony) Any more on this, David?

(David Sommer) no...for now.

(John A) DOES RESIDENT TELCOM PRG ALLOW DOWNLOAD TO DV/I?

(Sysop Tony) No.

(John A) OK THANX

(Sysop Tony) OK.

(Roger K) I just wanted to thank you for the help  last week the ramdir
  program worked !!!

(Sysop Tony) Aw, shucks... 'twern't nothin'.... (he said, kicking his toe in
  the dirt.) - I don't remember exactly what your problem was,  but as long as
  it's fixed, or working, or usable, whatever... great. Any more, Roger?

(Roger K) no

(Sysop Tony) OK

(Roger K) Is there any program in the DL that  I can use to automatically
  update a inventory program that i am working on?

(Sysop Tony) Well, considering that there is only one inventory program
  available there probably isn't one that is designed to "update" it.  Have
  you already looked at the inventory program in DL4?

(Roger K) Yes that is the one i am modifing to  use for my needs i am just
  stuck on the part of it!

(Sysop Tony) Well, suggest you leave a message on the board  for the author of
  the program, and ask for help.  That's the best way to get right to the
  horse's mouth.  (so to speak).

(gene) That's my prg  & I'm pretty sure it does have an update function

(Sysop Tony) (Or, talk to the author right here. [grin])  ga Jerry

(Jerry F) I`m back, thanks for the help .

(Sysop Tony) Yes... well,  Roger, did you want to get into what problems
  you're having with the program?

(Roger K) Gene  Yes I would!

(Sysop Tony) Well, go ahead.

(gene) [ 100, 102 or 200]

(Roger K) i am useing a hundred. Tony I am done if you what to go on.

(Sysop Tony) go ahead, Roger, don't mind us.  We're just playing.  Well, maybe
  you and Gene would like to talk privately.  You can, you know.

(Roger K) I will sen with Gene

(Sysop Tony) Roger is job 116, and Gene is 128  go to it.  ga Bruce

(bruce) is there any way to update interal  modem to 1200 baud ?

(Sysop Tony) Not without extensive hardware modifications.  It can be done,
  but it's far easier to buy a cheap external modem.

(bruce) once read about a 1200 chip in PORT 100  but called mfg who was
  unhelpful

(Sysop Tony) Well, I can't speak for him, but manufacturers would rather  deal
  with large volume users.  A single retail buyer is often a pain in the...
  if you get my drift.  But there is nothing that simply "plugs in".  it
  would really require some changes.  They don't even use the same frequencies.

(bruce) okay thanx ...that's all

(Sysop Tony) OK... ga David

(David Sommer) I was wondering...

(Jon Diercks) [hi!]

(David Sommer) if anyone else has had TELCOM or  XMDPW5 disconnect right
  after the autolog on sequence is done

(Sysop Tony) Oh yes.  That problem depends on properly constructing the logon
  sequence...

(David Sommer) or ^@'s (nulls) in a XMODEM (XMDPW5)

(Sysop Tony) (Ooops.  sorry)

(David Sommer) download file ...?

(Sysop Tony) Better let Phil deal with that one, since you're discussing his
  program. Phil?  You awake?  ga Phil  Hmmmmm  Phil is there, but seems to
  have fallen asleep.  ....

(Sysop Tony) Let's come back to that.

(gene) Tony, I think you modifyed SIDWAY to SIDWY2  & TCOMP won't compile it
  for me. Initial prg gave me no problem. Any suggestions?

(Sysop Tony) The author made some revisions after a week or so of the original
  program.  The revision compiled OK for me, and worked correctly.  The
  original compiled, but didn't work right.  What problem did you have
  compiling it?

(gene) not an OM error but a COMPILER OM ERROR

(Sysop Tony) Well, I don't know what to do to duplicate the problem.
  Personally,  I emptied out RAM, and had only the compiler, and the target
  program in RAM when it did the work. ... I _might_ have had the target
  program on disk but I don't think so. ....  If you need the program,  it's
  OK, but on my printers, compressed will give you 132 columns, which is
  apparently SIDWY's limit, too.  But in sideways PICA.

(gene) Your rite again. Will try that. Thankx ga done

(Sysop Tony) OK

(gene) [forgot to clear RAM]

(Sysop Tony) Phil's still asleep.  ga Jon

(Jon D) Anyone use SPLCHK w/ TS-DOS

(gene) not me

(Jon D) not POWR-DOS....I've been having some trouble w/  some of the support
  prgs....(addict, utldic) haven't dug into them enough to describe the prob
  exactly...just isn't working right....I think one of the prgs is trying to
  read off only two dictionary disks, but I've got'em spread to 3 ga

(Sysop Tony) Yes, I have... since I was involved in developing it.  But you'd
  have to be more specific about the problem, so i could try to duplicate it
  and see if there is really a problem there, or what.  They were tested on
  all 3 of the alternate DOS's at the time of development.

(Jon D) ok, will play w/ them some more & get back to you  wonder if it has to
  do with the version....think my TS-DOS is an earlier one. (1.0x?)

(Sysop Tony) One more tweak... you're using POWER-DOS which was not available
  at the time of development.  But it's not likely TS-DOS, I have several
  versions, dating from pre-release beta test version, through 1.0, 1.1, 1.2,
  etc...   The reader programs were designed to work with multi-disk files,
  but perhpas there are problems with the utility programs.

(Jon D) ok, I'll dig some more ... tks ... done and leaving

(gene) what DOS are we discussing?

(Sysop Tony) TS-DOS.

(gene) ok because it works fine w/ POWR-DOS

(Sysop Tony) You're still using the disk spelling checker?

(gene) too slow. only for small files

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, speed was always one of it's problems.  Traveling
  Software's ROM/disk...

(gene) [It saw its' day...SARDINE!!!!

(Sysop Tony) version or the All-ROM version seems the way to go.  Mark was
  gonna send me a copy, but never did. 

(gene) it's a shame, all the time & effort put into it

(Sysop Tony) Oh, well...  Anyone have a topic?

(gene) I think the Sysops should put their own "Best of M100 (m200)" prgs
  on the board

(Sysop Tony) We have discussed that, Gene.  It seems "The Best Of" book that
  CIS puts out is woefully out of date, and there don't seem to be  any
  immediate plans to update it.  So we discussed putting up our own Best of
  files... Just haven't gotten around to it yet.

(gene) done

(Phil) Re problem with xmdpw5 noted a couple  of pages back, the log-on
  problem can occur if you have the wrong xmdhaz version.  It will close all
  files on entry.  But no one should have THAT one!  The ^@'s are nulls.
  XMDPW5 cannot make those.  Likely there is another thing going on here,
  maybe a low power cond. or a marginal memory chip.  Not any of this seen or
  reported to date.

(David Sommer) the nulls only happen at the end of  the file and only a few of
  them if ever no big deal: I can just delete them.

(Phil) TEll  me more re the log-on bit.

(David Sommer) [me?]

(Phil) I thot there was...

(Sysop Tony) Yes,

(David Sommer) ok

(Phil) a comment re disconnecting at end of log-on.

(David Sommer) 1. I use the same auto logon i've  always used but within the
  last week the problem occured: as soon as  the sequence is done  i hear the
  relay disconnect-then silence. usually have to
  power off-on to fix.  It is not  a consistent problem either  Oh!...It's
  happened since I've had this new TDD2 of mine (about a week)

(Phil) Aha -- may have a comm stat problem there, due to TDD.  AND -- the
  presence of ^@'s in one file often means others are corrupted (maybe even
  ADRS.DO or XMDPW5.CO.  You may want to clean house and recreate everything.

(David Sommer) mmmm  yeah...i think I'll watch what goes  on for a pattern. and
  see how  a clean house 'smells'.GA,done.and must leave now.

(Sysop Tony) OK...  Thanks.  ga Peter

(PETER COHEN) HI WHAT DOES ga MEAN

(David Sommer) [Yawn/BYE!]

(Sysop Tony) "ga" means "I am done, you can GO AHEAD".  ga

(Phil) [God awful!]

(PETER COHEN) THANKS   I AM NEW AT THIS BUT ARE WILLING TO LEARN

(Sysop Tony) Please type "ga" when you're finished, so we know we can
  continue. 

(PETER COHEN) OK

(Sysop Tony) Can you type in lower case letters?  It looks like you're
  shouting.

(PETER COHEN) yes

(Sysop Tony) Hello Gary.  You gonna talk this week? Ah! There he is.

(Gary D.) Sure.....can I...

(Sysop Tony) Yea, you can. ga.

(Gary D.) O.K  I see BACKUP.200 in DL10 for auto backup to a cassette  is
  there such a program for auto backup to a TDD?

(Sysop Tony) There are backup programs for the TDD-1, don't know about the
  TDD-2.  Take a look in DL10 with the command S/KEY BACKUP.

(Phil) Seems like you may want a Save All function.  I think DSKMGR has such
  a feature if that is what backup does on CAS: for 200.

(Gary D.) OK

(Sysop Tony) Yeah, that's what it does.

(Gary D.) Many thanks. I have DSKMGR but never really  looked hard at it. Will
  do now!

(gene) COPY.BA, on TDD disk will  backup to CAS or DISK, your choice  [TDD 1 ]

(Sysop Tony) Uhhhh... do you mean it will backup  all files in RAM to a disk
  or cassette?

(gene) yes !!!

(Phil) Is that a FLOPPY  program with util disk or part of POWR-DOS?

(gene) opps...POWR_DOS  sorry

(Sysop Tony) I think he means it is a program on the TDD-1 Utility disk.
  Uh huh.  So, the truth will out.

(Phil) Thot it was PD -- and I think it needs PD isntalled to work.

(Sysop Tony) Well, which TDD do you have, Gary?

(Gary D.) I use the ol' TDD-1, but  since I also have DSKMGR, I guess I
  already have the utility, just never noticed it!

(Sysop Tony) Also, take a look at SAVALL in DL9.  May be what you want.  Any
  more on this topic? Anyone?

(gene) no

(Gary D.) Nope!

(Phil) most empjhatically not!

(Sysop Tony) Well then

(PETER COHEN) i would like to know how i can increase ram above 32k in my m100

(Sysop Tony) There are a number of ways  Since there are a number of companies
  who develop and market...

(Phil) ga

(Sysop Tony) products to do just that.  The choices are too numerous to
  mention But here's a capsule description:  Expanding RAM is a common interest
  of many users, so we have prepared files on the subject that cover much more
  than we can here. Depending on your interest, see EXPAND.RAM (100-200) or
  EXPAND.102, or if you want a LOT of RAM space, see BIGRAM.INF. (all in DL13)
   For the 600, see EXPAND.600 in DL11.  There are several new RAM expansion
  products available for the 100/102 PCSG has a 256K unit that gives you 8
  "banks" which can be used the same as the original bank. Node Computers has
  a 256K bank that can be used as one continuous bank, to store large files,
  much as you would on a disk. See the file NODE.REV in DL13.  And PG Designs
  is advertising one called the "Vault"... as in "Storage Vault".  See
  VAULT.THD in DL13.  Traveling Software has  just announced one that can hold
  up to 2 megabytes of RAM, and several ROM's.  See the file BOOSTR.PRD in
  DL13.

(Gary D.) [My, don't you type fast!!!]

(gene) [& only 2 misspelled words]

(Sysop Tony) I was disappointed to learn that you can't write files to the
  Node device and that no files can be larger than your available RAM space.
  Too bad.   Phil, did you have a comment?

(PETER COHEN) thanks alot ,also where can i get the magazine portable
  computing with model 100

(gene) [Dalton Book Stores]

(Sysop Tony) The one you want is called Portable 100.  See the file MAG.100 in
  DL13 for address and subscription info.  (Portable Computing) is a different
  one.) Next?

(PETER COHEN) thank you tony

(gene) ok. I don't think AUTO (new u/load) was tested on the M100
  ( lines don't work with the 100

(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm...

(gene) [opp 9 lines]

(Sysop Tony) Well, suggest you leave a message to the author  He developed it
  on a 100 I think.   It looked OK from just reading it, but I didn't run it.
  Where did you have a problem?

(gene) screen scrooling for prompts  & FC errors, also EOF errors

(Sysop Tony) Uh huh... well, that's one of the problems with making it 100/200
  compatible.  But be sure to leave him a message, I'd like him to know there
  are problems. Change of topic:  Gene,  Were you aware that there is a
  group of magicians who are holding conferences in one of the CB channels
  regularly?  They call it Micro Magicon.  Gary's a magikian, too.

(gene) yes read about it "Online" if that is the same group. If not do u have
  the time/day 

(Sysop Tony) No, I don't.  Problem is, the CB's have no message board to leave
  such inquiries.  Maybe a message to feedback would locate that info for you.
   Or  if you can find that back issue, a message to the author of the
  article.

(gene) good idea, both of them. will try Feedback

(Sysop Tony) Gary, did you have any info on that?

(Gary D.) No

(gene) [Micro Magic?]

(Sysop Tony) Micro Magicon.

(Gary D.) I haven't had the time to check out the Online guys, unfortunately.

(Sysop Tony) OK.... ga David

(David E) hello after a long time gone  I have been busy lately and have
  forgoten some of the things here  I need to download a file off onother
  computer by phone, it is an ascii file but I get  control charters any way,
  how can I stop or clean them out easly.

(Sysop Tony) Depends on what control characters they are. ...
  Actually file transfers are relatively easy.  You shouldn't get EXTRA
  characters in the transfer.  If you do, something's wrong.

(David E) well  it was a word processing file to begin with  which had
  everything removed that was less then 32 and greater than 127  but when i
  download it I get a ^]Y bwtween every sentance  This is not a compuseve
  download as you may have guessed.  ga

(Sysop Tony) Well, if I recall correctly, the ^] is the ESCape character.

(Phil) [Yup!]

(Sysop Tony) Don't know about the Y, but if you get an escape, and they're not
  supposed to be there then something's putting them in.  You gotta find that,
  it seems to me.

(David E) that is what I was hoping you could tell me.

(Phil) You know, this sounds a lot like the file that someone put up as a doc
  for  one of James Yi's pgms; seems like it was a Mac WP file.

(Sysop Tony) What brand/type of computer is sending the file?

(David E) IBM xt at the store I work at.

(Phil) What word processor???

(David E) wordstar is the wp

(Sysop Tony) You know, you might be well advised to get Phil's program
  FLTIBM, and do a direct RS-232 transfer to eliminate any outside problem.

(David E) sorry perhaps word perfect.

(Phil) [also it will strip the WS file!]

(David E) that was  what I figured myself but was hoping to save the trouble
  of taking my comuter in to the store.

(Sysop Tony) Take a look in DL3, for FLTIBM.INF, to start off with.  ga Phil

(Sysop Denny) Hi Folks, am I late?

(Phil) There are utilities in most WP's to convert a file to ASCII.  Seems
  like...

(Sysop Denny) (grin)

(Phil) you need to look into that a bit.  And there are lots of converters
  in the IBM SW forum to do this for varous WP's.

(Sysop Tony) OK... any more on that David?

(Phil) [Better never than late -- or is that the other way around??]

(David E) Well thanks for the info.

(Sysop Tony) Not in this case - Well, any final topics?  We're running
  overtime, But Denny has volunteered to keep the CO running. (tee hee)

(Sysop Denny) Well, I'm not using XMDPW5

(Gary D.) See wot happens when you're late? You forget how this works, Denny!
  (grin)

(Sysop Denny) Goes to show you.

(Phil) [and why not!!]

(Sysop Tony) Beats Me.  (ynoT)

(Sysop Denny) You wouldn't want of be where I was just now.

(Phil) where?

(Sysop Tony) Well, it looks like we're out of time for this evening's
  conference.  So I'll end the formal conference now.  Feel free to stick
  around and chat further, if you like.  Thanks for coming tonight, we
  appreciate your input.   Bye.

   *** END OF FORMAL CONFERENCE ***

(Gary D.) Dare we ask?
