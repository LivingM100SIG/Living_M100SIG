(Leonard E) I have a request for an 'exaample' of how to use ATFIX to fix a
 busted FAT. Gonna be *real* fun coming up with that.
(Sysop Tony) Hmmmm.... shouldn't that sort of thing be in the DOC file?
 if at all? Oh, I see what you mean.....
(Leonard E) Well, I thought that I had enough  info but obviously not.
(Sysop Tony) Yeah....Kind of like....
 "Tell me all about the Model 100... in 400 words or less...."  
(Leonard E) right...
(Sysop Tony) We have literally gotten messages like that!
(Leonard E) I think I'll tell him how to change FATPRT to write to a RAM file
 and have him send it to me then I can tell him how to fix it.
(Sysop Tony) "How does the D/VI work?"  "How can I write a DBMS program?"  etc.
(Leonard E) FM!
(Sysop Tony) Why not just tell them to run a magnet across the disk first?
 (heh heh)

(Larry L) [What's with Dave?]
(Sysop Tony) Dave's fingers are not working well. He's sitting this one out.
(Larry L) [We have to get him a voice activated M100]
(.^Dave^.) [flew bugh tu.]

(Larry L) I was looking over the M100 schematics and noticed that the modem
 chip has a option that lets you use CCITT frequencies. These are the
 frequencies used in Europe. Is this common knowledge? I have seen nothing on
 this subject.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, it's common knowledge among folks who understand schematics
 and there has been discussion here before on it. In fact, in the hardware
 section DL 13, there is a .PRD file on a company that makes conversion kits
 available, including a switch that makes it switchable.  Both Rowlfe Getsla
 and I traced the circuit down once.

(Larry L) I have been trying to save programs on cassette tape.  I bought a
 standard tape recorder; it will properly load Tandy programs but will not load
 progs that I have saved. Is ther something I am doing wrong?
(Sysop Tony) While many cassette recorders CAN be used to save and load
 programs, it often requires considerable fiddling around with the volume
 and/or tone controls on those recorders not specifically designed for computer
 use. Most folks find the $29 Radio Shack CCR-82 which is designed for computer
 use, to be the best buy.
(Phil F.) Most standard tape recorders cannot handle the frequency of most
 computers. I got an ad from Radio Shack that the Tandy Disk Drive is on sale
 for 129. That's what I am going to get only 2 weeks after getting the CCR-82.
(Leonard E) believe it or not, there are some BRANDS of tape that don't work
 for computer use! I've got a few "Intermagnetics" cassettes that seem to
 record fine, but the computer can't read the data!!!! (don't ask me what the
 problem is)
(Larry L) I cant believe that a standard tape recorder could'nt handle the
 freq. required. I think the TONE has much more to do with it.  I have a
 circuit that converts sine waves to square waves. I think this may solve the
 problem. I think, though, that I will buy the TDD.
(Sysop Tony) Larry.... actually, the main problem is that the computer data IS
 square wave, and many tape recorders, particularly cheap ones, won't handle
 the conversion to sine wave well.
(Leonard E) first, if your recorder has AGC, it is useless for computer use.
 AGC is also known as automatic level control.
 Second, for God only knows what reason, the frequencies used in the cassette
 interface are harmonically related. This means that distortion (or a tone
 adjustment) can change a 1 to a 0 thus scrambling data. And I must repeat my
 comment re brand of tape. I have no idea WHY but some don't work.
(Sysop Tony) I'd guess that some brands of tape simply won't handle the
 frequency requirements, particularly cheap brands. As I recall, Intermagnetics
 is made by Certon (Assembled in Mexico) , and is one of the cheapest.
 However, folks even have trouble with the Radio Shack "Computer Cassettes",
 so who's to know.  Personally, I think cassette use except in rare
 emergencies, or in the case of buying new software (where it can't be avoided)
 should be AVOIDED with great regularity!
(Larry L) I tend to think of my m100 as a standalone unit. I have the expanded
 Ram so I tend to keep programs in the comp. I only use the cassette for
 archiveing programs.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, but cassette is the least reliable of the storage methods.
(Leonard E) Larry, silly question, but how are the jacks on the recorder
 labeled & which ones do you have the two gray plugs plugged into (black plugs
 is obviously correct).
(Larry L) As best as I can remember...Black goes to EAR...Large grey goes to
 MIC and small grey goes to REMOTE.
(Leonard E) [AHA!] Larry, large gray must go to AUX! You are overloading the
 MIC input!
(Larry L) ???
(Leonard E) M100 output is LINE level much stronger than a mike signal.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's correct. There are several files in DL 9 which relate
 to that.  The computer output is a "line level" output. Bill Templeton wrote
 an article for Portable 100 on the subject, and even designed an adapter for
 the problem.  See the files in DL 9. Use the command BRO/KEY RECORDER or
 similar to find them.
(.^Dave^.) micrec.100, micrec.wht, micrem,100; micro-recorders; DL 9
(Sysop Tony) Bill also used micro-recorders, those with the teeny-tiny
 cassettes, successfully, when using the adapters.


(Leonard E) Any comments/questions on my current DVI utilities?
 Or requests for additional ones? I've got plans, but would be nice to know
 "the public" wants/needs.
(Sysop Tony) I haven't seen any.  And don't have any. As many of us have
 found, if it works, you'll never hear about it. but if it doesn't, you'll get
 a million messages. otherwise, no one even says "Thanks".
 (By the way.... Thanks!)
(Leonard E) Would you consider trying out my BILLS program on a TDD? I'd like
 to know which OS's it will won't work with.
(Sysop Tony) If it uses disk access then it will work with ALL the TDD access
 programs. And if the syntax is the same as the DVI syntax, the Chipmunk, too.
(Leonard E) It *requires* the ability to read/write strings containing
 ALL 256 chars (^@,^Z & DEL).
(Sysop Tony) Well, the problem there might be with the null character.
 However, all the DOS's will read most anything with a LINEINPUT statement,
 or an INPUT(1.1) type of statement.  With the exception, maybe, of TS-RANDOM,
 which I don't have, nor have we seen. I'd suspect the ^@ character would
 create problems for you somewhere.
(Leonard E) I used INPUT$(1,1) for just that reason. Line INPUT drops all ctrl
 chars. I know that DVI will read anything with INPUT$(1,1). 
(Sysop Tony) And, (reviewing your comment) the ^Z is a forbidden character in
 a file since it is the EOF marker on disk files.  I can see that you'd be
 anxious to have someone try it on the other disk drives.
(Leonard E) Believe it or not, The DVI ignores ^Z unless it is in the sector
 marked in the FAT as being the last one!!!!
(Sysop Tony) Huh! I'd think that using INPUT(1,1), you could read right past
 the end of the file into the next, or old, or bad data.
(Leonard E) Haven't had that happen, but it is possible to 'modify' the FAT to
 point back to the same cluster and get an 'infinite length' file
(Sysop Tony) There you go fooling with the allocation table again. (grin)
(Leonard E) [but it's FUN]
(Sysop Tony) So how do you test for EOF?
(Leonard E) I don't, the system seems to know where it is (so I just keep my
 fingers crossed!). Been using it for a year with no trouble.
(Sysop Tony) Oh gawd!  Talk about "seat of the pants programming"! That's one
 of the FIRST things users will have trouble with!
(Leonard E) [sorry, I do use EOF(1)]
(Sysop Tony) How do you combine INPUT(1,1) with an EOF test?
(Leonard E) Easy; I do an EOF(1) at the start of the loop that inputs the
 record.
(Sysop Tony) So your file may have SEVERAL ^Z's in it, then?
(Leonard E) Sure. Remember, I'm saving numeric values in the 100's *internal*
 format, thus 50% of the occurences of the hmmmmm... no it won't!
 1A is hex for ^Z and that can't occur in a number! But some of the other data
 might cause a ^Z, YEAH! Any time person#1 has a BILL#10 you'd get a ^Z (or is
 it the other way round)?
(Sysop Tony) And what is the overall purpose of the program?  To keep track of
 your bills? or payments?
(Leonard E) At one point there were SIX(!) of us to split the bills among, and
 some bills (phone) are not even splits! And it keeps track of the odd
 fractions of a cent ($10 split six ways is $1.6666666666667).
 And to save me the trouble of figuring bills by hand!
(Sysop Tony) Oh, yes... that one. I am reminded of the scene in the film
 "It's a MAD (4!) World" where they are discussing how to divvy up the loot.
 One share for being in a car...
 one share for being a person in the car....
 one share for going down to the body...
(Leonard E) well that's about it, but it may be worth people's while to
 read thru the program for 'unusual' programming tricks.


(Phil F.) F4 in TEXT is unused, is it possible to use this key, and if so how?
(Sysop Tony) There is a way, but it has to do with writing a machine language
 patch that grabs the interrupt vectors, and reroutes the OS through your
 special routine.  Beyond the grasp of most users, and most programmers.
 Otherwise, the answer is "No, not generally".
(Phil F.) Is there something in the D/L that might give me some clues as far as
 the memory locations and types of patches. if not how about a book on the
 subject. I would like to learn alot more about M/L programing.
(Sysop Tony) The memory locations, yes. I can point you towards that, but as
 for patches, no, you'd have to write your own.  There is a file in DL3,
 either TELKEY or TELTIP which is a good place to start. it discusses the
 vector jump table, and how it works with the TELCOM keys.   Then the file
 HOOKS.100 in DL8 should give you some more info. For info on assembly language
 programming, TUTORA.ASM through TUTORD.ASM is a good start. probably also in
 DL8. No specific book on machine language programming for the Model 100 family
 although it's said to be similar to the Z-80 code, so probably a book on that
 would be useful. OK? (Or was that 8085 code?)
(.^Dave^.) Leventhal's book is the standard reference.
(Sysop Tony) Title?
(.^Dave^.) nope
(Eric S.) The title of the Leventhal book is "8080A-8085 Assembly Language
 Programming by Lance A. Leventhal". 


(Eric S.) Just purchased the PDD and was looking for an alternate O/S for it.
 Any suggests.
(Sysop Tony) See the file DISKOS.INF in DL 9 for that information, in depth.
(.^Dave^.) Eric, start with DSKMGR.100 and .DOC in DL 9.
(Sysop Tony) Yes, that's here. DSKMGR is here, but it's not as useful as a
 commercial OS for the drive. it's an improved version of FLOPPY.CO, though.
 The TDD is just going on sale.  If you paid more than $129 for it you may be
 entitled to a refund.  Check the back of your sales receipt and query the
 store where you bought it.  General Radio Shack policy allows you to return
 anything in 30 days, and buy it again at the reduced price.
(.^Dave^.) Source says that $80 refund is to be expected for folks that paid
 $199.99 in December without having to return first.
(Sysop Tony) Good policy, but figures don't match. Buy it for $199, then get an
 $80 refund means you got it for $119.  ????  Any clarification on that?
(.^Dave^.) didn't query source. 

(Eric S.) Back on the O/S for the PDD.  Any one that will allow d/l to disk?
(Sysop Tony) No.  None of them have that capability. But it's not their fault!
 The computer has only one communications chip, and when used for modem you
 can't access the RS-232 port without disconnecting.  So DL to disk is not
 possible.  You can "simulate" the function using an external modem, either to
 communicate, or to hold the line while you do a disk access.
 See the files DSKTRM.* in DL 3.


(Rich W) 1st ,regarding superrom (if anyone here can answer). Can a thought
 file be printed from 1 PGSG rom bank to another?
(Sysop Tony) Mike Anders, who is the PCSG rep, was here earlier and could have
 given you a definitive answer on that one. My guess is that you can transfer
 files between banks. PCSG supports file transfer between banks.
 so probably yes.
(Rich W) 2nd question...is Port 100 definitely fini. and is JD's new mag going
 to fly?
(Sysop Tony) No... they are trying to get a January issue out but who knows
 "where" from there?
  The question about JD's new magazine is verrrry premature.  No one knows
 yet whether it is even viable.  He has to round up 50,000 subscribers to make
 it work as a free magazine, deriving his income only from the advertisers.
 If ANYONE can make it work, JD can.  He's well experienced, both in editing,
 and the publishing field.


(David S.) Thanks-- I just tuned in, so I'm guessing what it's all about,
 but about Portable 100, I got a _subscription_ issue in the mail a few weeks
 ago, so I know they're trying.
 my question may have been covered earlier but does anybody here know yet
 whether there will be software support for the new Tandy portable drive
 equivalent to the old drive and whether there's any degree of compatibility
 between the old and the new?
(Sysop Tony) first, on the Portable 100 comment.
 All the subscribers received the latest issue in the last few weeks
 so that's nothing new.  However, that issue was 4 months late and had been
 sitting around in a warehouse for that time.  It was available on news stands
 in August.  The June issue was never mailed; it's still sitting in the
 warehouse.  So they haven't yet cleaned up their act. also they ARE in
 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, so they have some protection from creditors while they
 try to get it all back together.  We will have to wait and see.
 Yes, there will be support for the TND (Tandy's New Drive) here; how much is
 going to depend on what sort of support is needed and forthcoming.  We can't
 be very specific now, as no one has seen, nor bought the new one.  All we have
 is "leaked" information.  It may be 200 K, it may be 360K.... it may be single
 sided, or double sided. it may be a giraffe, or a rhinocerous. get the idea? 
 We don't know what it is, so we can't say how much support is going to develop
 for it.  But we WILL support it.
(.^Dave^.) [200K guaranteed, $199.95]
(David S.) --just the comment re the magazine, that pulling together the
 capital for a subscription mailing, however late, is not a trivial commitment
 on their part.
(Sysop Tony) However, when you don't have to pay any bills for four months,
 while continuing to take subscriptions, .....
(Rich W) The reasaon I had brought it up in the 1st place is that the mag
 vendor in the World Trade Center (NYC) who carries P100, told me that it had
 been cancelled by his supplier. A bad sign.
(Sysop Tony) They have had a "dicey" relationship with several distributors. 
 I'd not worry about that.
(.^Dave^.) Suppliers in my area cancelled two years ago.
(Sysop Tony) I think they'll try hard to get out a January issue which,
 incidently, was originally promised as a December issue but their future is
 still very "iffy". they laid off almost all their staff, so whatever they
 do they are doing with a skeleton crew.


(Phil F.) This dosen't have much to do with the M100SIG directly, but sometimes
 when I am using the DL or the message board or somewhere else on CIS, I get
 "hung-up". The phone line is still on, but everything freezes. I have
 contacted FEEDBACK and they gave me all the standard stuff like CTRL Q,
 CTRL C, etc. but nothing works.  Does anyone know why?
(Sysop Tony) Well, there are a couple of possibilities. One is that somehow,
 possibly line noise, a CTRL-S has been sent stopping transmission.  CTRL-Q may
 restart you. Also, there are a number of small "waits" that occur, depending
 on how many users on the system, exactly what is happening etc. but they
 generally are no more than 10-15 seconds. There is a major stoppage, called a
 "Files busy" although we are seeing less of them around here lately.
 Then there are network problems, especially if you connect to CompuServe by
 any of the other services, such as Tymnet or Telenet. And then, there's the
 phase of the moon....
(David S.) OK-- you (and FEEDBACK) already mentioned ^Q, which is my only
 technical cure other than supreme patience.  "You mean you don't appreciate
 those pauses?" especially when you're in the middle of composing a long piece
 of EMAIL or an on-line reply to a SIG message?   
(Leonard E) Well, ^Q won't help if you've recieved a ^S as the 100 won't let
 you SEND until the ^S is cleared. SHIFT-PAUSE (BREAK) will clear it in TELCOM.
 In other terminal programs, you're on your own. As for System loading, I've
 seen pauses of over a minute on a *HEAVILY* loaded CIS node (6pm on Fri is a
 lousy time to call!)
(Sysop Tony) True, but generally the ^S goes to the host, which CAN be cleared
 with ^Q. If it comes to your computer, you see the word "Wait" over the [6] at
 the bottom of your screen.  Bottom line is that we are all subject to delays
 because the hardware is not perfect!  Imagine, dumping ME just a half hour
 or so ago; right in the middle of a conference!


(Sysop Tony) OK.... CO is ended, but stick around and talk if you like....
 Revert to Yak-yak mode.
 Bye.
