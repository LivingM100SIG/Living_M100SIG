SHTL27.NEC is an enhancement of Lorne Williams' SPSHTL which is, in turn, a
 Model 100 version of Gary Ludeke's program for the Color Computer
 published in 80 U.S. February 83.

The information in this documentation partially repeats and partially
 augments the information in SHTLDO.DO in XA3.


You are piloting the Space Shuttle, a deadstick (no engines) glider.

If you choose <F>ull Descent - You start at 30,000 feet altitude, one mile east
 of the runway, heading north, descending at an angle of 15 degrees
 below horizontal, airspeed 600 mph.

If you choose <P>ractice Final Approach -  You start at 10,000 feet altitude,
 10 miles due north of runway heading due south, descending at an angle of 1
 degree below horizontal, airspeed 600 mph.
 
 You must land 20 feet either side of the runway centerline heading exactly
 180 degrees (due south), at more than 180 mph, with a vertical speed less
 than 7 feet per second.  The runway is 3 miles long.

	<g> will lower landing gear.  The gear create a lot of drag, so don't
 lower them til the last moment.  Once lowered they can't be raised.
	<s> opens spoilers, <c> closes them.  Use spoilers to moderate speed.
        <up arrow> decreases descent angle (raises nose)
	<down arrow>, the opposite.
	<right arrow> initiates or increases a right turn by one degree
 per second.  Maximum is three.
	<left arrow>, the opposite.

	The instruments are, from left to right:
mph--air speed indicator (beeps at less than 200 mph),
alt--altimeter
da--descent angle
dme-distance measurement from runway in nautical miles.
tr-turn rate (+ for right, - for left)
hdg--compass heading
distE or distW--distance east or west of runway centerline,
vs--vertical speed
s--* indicates spoilers open
g--^ indicates gear up, v indicates down

You are free to take any approach to the runway.  Landing area will come into
 view when you are on course (dist from runway centerline<100 and hdg=180).


Suggestion:  Get yourself lined up with the runway 10 or so miles out and then
 adjust your descent angle to make your final approach. 

It's not easy at first but persistence will pay off.  Happy landings!
