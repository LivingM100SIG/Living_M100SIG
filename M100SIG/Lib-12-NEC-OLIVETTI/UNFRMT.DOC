                                  INTRODUCTION

     When text material is downloaded from a computer system, it is usually
formatted to a specific line width.  If you attempt to print it out using a
different width, you can get some strange-looking short lines and other
awkward blocking.  This is unfortunate, as it would often be nice to be able to
print out the text using a formatter, with page numbering, headers, footers,
etc. Most text formatting programs require a carriage-return only at end
of paragraphs.
     Unless you have access to a program which will Search and Replace
carriage returns, the alternative has been to go through the file and
manually delete the carriage returns. UNFORM.NEC was created to eliminate
this tedious chore.
     UNFORM.NEC makes the decisions, on a line-by-line basis, whether to leave
or remove a carriage return, and, if the carriage return is dropped, whether
to insert 0, 1, or 2 spaces in its place.  It will delete returns within a
paragraph, and leave them at the end of a paragraph, on blank lines, and on
formatted lists.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS

     Delete any garbage material from the beginning and end of the file.
     Run the program.  Press any key to move from the program title page.  You
will be asked for the name of the file you wish to unformat.  Just type in the
name of the file and [ENTER].  Do not enter the ".DO" extension.  For this
example, we will say the name of the file is "TESTER.DO".
     The screen will now read "Measuring TESTER.DO".  This message
will remain on the screen for as much as a minute or more, depending upon the
length of the file.  You need not stay at the computer; it will BEEP at any
point in the program where you must take an action.
     You will then be told the width of the file.  This is the greatest length
of any line in the file.  On pressing any key, you will be shown a sample
line and asked "Is this a typical length line?"  This will help to catch
any garbage before, after, or within the body of the file.  It is critical,
because the program will make many of its decisions based on the line length.
If you answer "Y" the program will continue.  If you answer "N" then it
will start measuring again, looking for a SHORTER line.
     Assuming you have answered "Y", you will now see "Unformatting
TESTER.DO".  On completion the screen will read  that the unformatting is
complete, and you will be asked if you want to retain the original file.  If
you answer "N" then you will exit to the menu, where the revised TESTER.DO
will be waiting for you.  If you answer "Y" then you will be told the new name
of the OLD file, which will be OLD followed by the first three letters of
the file name (in this case, OLDTES.DO).

                                  PRECAUTIONS

     UNFORM.100 is intended for use only on previously formatted text
files.  It is not recommended for program listings, or any other type of
file in which carriage returns are CRITICAL to the meaning of the file.
It should, however, be able to handle formatted lists within a text file.
     Note that the program will not format an unformatted file and also
that any file with a line of over 200 characters will be rejected.  It will
also reject a file with control characters, so do not imbed printer
characters until AFTER running UNFORM.NEC.
     The program creates a second, unformatted file, while retaining the
original, which may be kept if desired. This means that you must have adequate
free RAM.  If you do not have enough, the program will tell you so.
     Finally, the program is not perfect.  It is looking for clues as to
whether or not to leave in a carriage return, based on spaces, punctuation,
and line length.  If a line is formatted oddly, the program may err.
On the whole, however, it should give satisfactory results.  I have hit very
few snags after running several versions of it for several weeks.
     Addendum:
In converting the program I have simply replaced any Model 100 PRINT@
statements with NEC's LOCATE format and rectified a few other incompatible
BASIC statements.  Questions regarding the program's logic should be directed
to Don Zeikel, the program's author.
