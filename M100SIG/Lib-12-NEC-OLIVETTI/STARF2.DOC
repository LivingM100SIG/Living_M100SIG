This is Version 2.0 of Micro-Starfighter for the PC-8201. It combines Version
1.0 with STARCR in one program. You are asked whether you want instructions; if
you don't respond "Y" you go right to   the game. A "Y" response gives you the
screen formerly presented by STARCR,    after which pressing any key gets you
to the game.
					A word about line 18. This is a "filler" needed for the RESTORE in line 20 to
work properly. After your first play of
the game, line 18 will be replaced (by
means of line 90) with highest score
data. If the program ever operates 
erratically, check line 18. If it looks odd, replace it with: "18 GOTO19".
					See STARF.DOC in XA3 for End USer's
excellent playing instructions.
