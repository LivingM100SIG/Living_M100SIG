Preliminaries
=============
 
XMODEM ensures error-free file transfer when UPLoading or DOWnloading which
 Telcom alone does not.
 
XMODEM also allows UPLoading a program file with line lengths exceeding 132
 characters, unlike Telcom.
 
A transferred file must be a Text, or .DO file.
 
 
Logging on
==========
 
XMODEM requires that you log on to your host computer (or BBS) at STAT settings
 of either 3N81NN or 5N81NN (300 or 1200 baud, respectively).  On CompuServe,
 you may log on at 3I71XN or 5I71XN.  XMODEM will automatically change your
 STAT settings to 3N81NN or 5N81NN.
 
 
XMODEM Transfer (Download)
==========================
 
Once you are connected with the host, you must instruct it to begin an XMODEM
 transfer.  On CompuServe, this is accomplished with the DOW command at
a Data Library prompt (ex. DL7:)
 
DOW file.ext/PROTO:XMODEM/TYPE:ASCII
 
CompuServe will inform you that transfer has commenced and will tell you to hit
 ENTER when transfer is completed.  CompuServe will now wait until it
 receives acknowledgement from the NEC XMODEM program to begin.
 
After CompuServe informs you that it is beginning XMODEM transfer, you should
 exit TELCOM (this won't interrupt your phone connection) and choose XMODEM
 from the 8201's main menu.
 
Use a function key to choose Up or Download, then choose 300 or 1200 baud
 transfer rate, depending on which speed you were using in TELCOM.
 
XMODEM will then begin the transfer.  You will not see the characters scroll
 on the screen.  Instead you will see a "." for each 128-character block that
 is received successfully, followed by the block number.  A period represents
 XMODEM's acknowledgement of successful receipt of a block.  An "X" represents
 XMODEM's request to the host to repeat transmission of the block.  The block
 will be repeatedly sent until it is received correctly.  If you think you
 are getting too many X's, you should abort the XMODEM process by typing a
 CAPITAL "A".  (The Capital is important!).
 
When the transfer is complete, the 8201 will return from BASIC to Term (TELCOM)
 so you can initiate another transfer or continue other communications.  You
 should hit ENTER to complete the transfer.
 
 
Upload
======
 
On CompuServe, use the UPL command at a Data Library prompt (ex. DL7:)
 
UPL file.ext/PROTO:XMODEM/TYPE:ASCII
 
This time, when you enter the XMODEM program, use f.4 (function key 4, Up)
 and choose the transfer rate.  Remember, Capitalization is important
 when you specify a file name to be uploaded on the NEC.  ("Notes" is
 different from "NOTES" or "notes").  Function key 1, "Files", will produce
 a list of files in RAM from which to choose.  You will probably see a few
 question marks and X's before seeing a string of periods which indicate
 successful block transmission.  During upload you do not see the block number.
 
 
NOTE:  This program creates a machine language subroutine in high memory
 (61000 to 61186).  This will not interfere with CRT code, although it
 may interfere with CRT + BASIC code.  This program is compatible with
