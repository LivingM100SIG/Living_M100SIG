GRAFIX.ASC is a utility program written for the NEC PC8201A
portable computer.  Its purpose when active, is to intercept
outputs to the printer and check for characters which have been
defined as graphics characters using the CHRDEF utility.  It
prints these out as defined.  The program uses the commands
for 480 dots/ line required by my EPSON RX-80 printer, namely
"ESC K n1 n2" (HEX 1B 4B n1 n2).  where:
n1 = (number of data) mod 256;
n2 = int(number of data/256).
If your printer uses a different sequence, the routine can be
modified easily.  If you have downloadable fonts you probab-
ly don't need this utility.
In operation the utility resides at hex F000, so before accessing
it, a CLEAR,61439! must be executed from BASIC.  The loader
does this for you initially, but it will have to be entered after
any cold starts or running of programs that have CLEAR statements
higher that 61,439.  If you hear a beep when attempting to enter the
program from the menu, do the CLEAR statement.
To get the program running, download it and the loader program.
The loader will convert the ASCII into machine code at F000,
and BSAVE it to a .CO file in RAM.
When you run the program, you will see the main menu.  Your
options are:
1. Stop intercepting and exit
2. Begin intercepting and exit
3. Exit with no action taken
With the intercept active, graphics characters(>HEX 82 = decimal
130) cause the intercept routine to check for a graphics font
address at HEX FEBF.  If the address is zero nothing happens.
Otherwise the characters are saved in an decimal 80 character
buffer located above the program.  A non-graphics character will
cause the graphics buffer to be printed out, and then will itself
be printed.  Graphics characters beyond 80 characters will be
ignored, but continuous graphics can be achieved by printing a
carriage return-line feed pair between graphics lines(LPRINT after
80 chrs).
You can easily change graphics fonts between lines by BLOADing
previously defined character sets.
CAUTION!!!  If you don't exercise option 1, and load another
program to the area above 61,439, then try to LPRINT; the new
routine will be entered with unpredictable results.
You can excercise option 1 from BASIC by entering:
POKE 63960,219:POKE 63961,127

Have fun!
