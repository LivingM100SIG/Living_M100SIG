 Instructions for FtNote.BA
 
 by Tom Streeter, 75216.2530
 
    The unique thing about this formatter is that it's suitable for
 long manuscripts, particularly of an academic sort.  To see what it can do,
 use it to print out this file on your printer.  It has made it possible for
 me to use my NEC 8201A (with SideCar) as my only word processor for a 230
 page PhD dissertation (now on file at the University of Illinois).  It uses
 dot commands for centering, underlining, etc., and allows chaining
 of up to twelve files and printing embedded footnotes at the bottom of
 the page, in Modern Language Association (MLA) dissertation style.
 It's slow, but with a low-end letter quality printer, you'll never notice.
 (You may have to change the codes in line 120 to suit your printer before
 using this: UN = auto underline on; UO = auto underline off;
 SP = superscript or half linefeed backwards; SO = superscript off or
 half linefeed forwards; SH = shadow print or boldface; SN = shadow or
 boldface off.)
    Customizers may wish to know that this is a debugged, improved and
 compressed version of "Format.BA", published in the "NEC 8200 User
 Monthly" in 1985.  The line numbers in "FtNote.BA" more or less correspond
 to those in "Format", but comments and spaces have been removed to save RAM,
 and some lines have been collapsed. 
 
 Using FtNote.BA
 
    The input section of the program is designed to compensate for the
 NEC's small screen; you can see everything that's going on without
 loosing information as it scrolls by.  When the program is run, a list of
 text files appears at the bottom half of the screen, and the cursor appears
 next to the number "1" at the top.  Type in the first file name, using the
 prefix "CAS:" if the file is on tape, and then hit return, whereupon a
 number "2" appears, again next to the cursor.  Again type in the filename,
 hit return, and continue until all file names are entered, then just hit
 return. 
    When prompted with "Parameters?," type a lower case "y" if you want to
 change the defaults.  Then answer the following prompts (skipping any of the
 prompts by keying a CR produces the default for that parameter.)
      
   "Left margin?"
   "Line spacing?"
   "Line width?" (the width of the
      line BETWEEN margins)
   "First page #?" (page numbers less than 1 will NOT be printed; thus
      type 0 for a title page that should not be numbered and should
      be followed by page one, or -100 when you don't want any page
      numbers at all.)
   "First FN #?" (Sets the number assigned to the first footnote
      the formatter encounters; footnotes will be incremented by
      one after that). 
   "Paragraphing?" (This sets the paragraph indent.  A negative
      number can be used to produce a hanging indent, but the number
      must be smaller than the margin.)
   "Output?" (Specify "lpt:" for parallel, "com:" for serial, or
      "ram:")
   "Page halt? (y/n)" (Typing "y" causes the printer to stop at the
      end of each page to allow for insertion of single sheets.  When
      this happens, the prompt "Ready?" appears in the black bar, and
      typing "y" causes printing to resume.)

    Defaults are set in line 40 of the program.  Printer codes for
 underlining, boldface, and superscripts are set in line 120. 
 
 Preparing the Text
 
    A CR in the file creates a CR in the printed text.  Paragraph indenting
 occurs whenever a CR is followed by one or more spaces. (This means that a
 simple extra space or two at the beginning of a paragraph in TEXT
 results in a standard paragraph indentation in the formatted output.)
 The formatter removes extra spaces, but adds two spaces after a period at
 the end of a sentence, in accordance with normal typing practice.  (To turn
 off this feature, follow the period with a GRPH+C from the NEC keyboard,
 which the formatter will view as a character, but most printers will
 ignore.) Put dot commands in the text, separated from other words by spaces. 
 Put commands at the beginning of lines where possible.  (Leave out the quote
 marks shown in the following list; they're there just to fool the
 formatter into printing them, which ordinarily you don't want it to do.)
 To create a footnote, type ".fn" followed by the text of the note in
 curly brackets; e.g.  ".fn {Like this.}" Be sure to leave enough space
 in RAM to store footnotes while printing. 
 
      
   ".u" begins underlining, ".nou" ends it. 
   ".bold" begins boldface, ".nobold" ends it. 
   ".c" centers the following line. 
   ".page" advances to the next page. 
   ".quote" changes the parameters for  a long direct quote in MLA style
      (indented four spaces on right and left, single-spaced);
      ".noquote" returns things to normal. 
   ".x" causes the following word or character to be printed after the
      preceding word without a space in between.  Try printing this as an
      illustration:
      "( .x .u word .nou .x )". 
   ".lmN" changes the left margin, where N is the column number. 
   ".spN" changes the line spacing, where N is the number of spaces;
      (e.g., ".sp2" creates double spacing.)
   ".lwN" changes the line width, where N is the number of
      characters per line, not including the left margin. 
   ".inN" changes the paragraph indenting, where N is the number
      of characters to indent.  Hanging indents can be created with
      negative numbers.
