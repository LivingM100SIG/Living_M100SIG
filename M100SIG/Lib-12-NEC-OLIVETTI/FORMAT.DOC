      The set of commands:
      --------------------
      
              This program for the NEC  PC-8201A  will format a  TEXT file
      with embedded  graphics characters  which  will send commands to the
      EPSON FX-80 (and compatibles) to print special characters and fonts.
      E.g., an inverse video  'B'   (for BOLD On) and a  backwards inverse
      video 'B' (for BOLD Off),  the former  inserted just before the text
      to    be output in boldface, the latter just after such text,  would
      send the proper command to the Epson.
      There   is a  separate program,   GRPHCS.BA,    that will set up the
      graphics characters for you.
      The    graphics  characters that   FORMAT.BA recognizes, obtained by
      pressing the [GRPH key + an alpha key], are as follows:
      
       GRPH + c  = Center text line
        "   + p  = Paragraph indent
        "   + b  = Bold ON  (Dbl Strike On)
        "   + n  = Bold OFF (Dbl Strike Off)
        "   + i  = Italics ON
        "   + o  = Italics OFF
        "   + u  = Underline ON
        "   + y  = Underline OFF
        "   + e  = Expanded (dbl-wide) ON
        "   + w  = Expanded OFF
        "   + q  = NLQ ON
        "   + t  = NLQ OFF
        "   + s  = Superscript ON
        "   + a  = Subscript ON
        "   + d  = Scripts OFF
        "   + @  = US CH-Set (default) (0)
        "   + \  = French  CH-Set (1)
        "   + ,  = German  CH-Set (2)
        "   + .  = English CH-Set (3)
        "   + /  = Italian CH-Set (6)
        "   + ]  = Spanish CH-Set (7)
        "   + lx = change left  margin to x
        "   + rx = change right margin to x
        "   + h  = backspace
        "   + f  = page break (form feed)

      Changing the default parameters:
      --------------------------------
      
              Save both FORMAT and GRPHCS as .BA files.  First RUN GRPHCS.
      BA to set up the graphics  characters in memory. You may then delete
      it (after saving it to cas: or disk),  since the graphics characters
      will stay in memory until you  do a  cold start or  another  program
      changes the character definitions. Then  RUN  FORMAT.BA and you will
      be asked which text file you want to format (you can  also format  a
      file from the cassette, by specifying "CAS:fname", or the DEV:  name
      for the disk   drive, as the filename at this point: this allows for
      formatting a file that would not fit -or is   not- in  memory). Then
      you have the option of printing the file to Memory    (RAM:,  CAS: ,
      etc.),    Printer (parallel)    or  the   RS232 (serial, COM:3E71XN)
      interface. If Memory is  chosen,  you  will need to enter the output
      filename. Here you may specify a 'DEV:' name if you wish: CAS:, RAM:
      , COM:<CPBSXS> or a disk drive device & filename. If  you  chose the
      printer, you are asked to  make sure that the printer is on line and
      the  Top-Of-Form  is   at the proper place. Then you are prompted to
      change the default parameters  (margins,  single  or   double spaced
      lines, etc.) as follows:
      
       1.PITCH # : will set the printer to print in the given font.
      
       Pitch #           Font          Width
       -------    ------------------   -----
          0     = Single Strike Pica     80
         16     = Double   "      "      80
         32     = S.S. Expanded   "      40
         48     = D.S.     "      "      40
          8     = S.S. Emphasised "      80
         24     = D.S.     "      "      80
         40     = S.S. Exp. Emp.  "      40
         56     = D.S.  "    "    "      40
       -------------------------------------
          1     = Single Strike Elite    96
         17     = Double   "      "      96
         33     = S.S. Expanded   "      48
         49     = D.S.    "       "      48
       -------------------------------------
          4     = S.S. Compressed       132
         20     = D.S.      "           132
         36     = S.S. Exp. "            66
         52     = D.S.  "   "            66
       -------------------------------------
      
              The Bold,    Italics,  Underline and Scripts commands can be
      intermixed within the same  Pitch. To  print a   draft copy,  use  a
      pitch # of  0 (or even 4 for compressed) ; for the  final  copy, use
      one of the emphasised fonts (8,24) or the NLQ font.
      
              Note: If you print to RAM or the RS232 interface  the  pitch
      # will have no effect,  nor will any of the printer commands, except
      TAB, left/right margins and centering.
      







                                     -  2  -



      2.PITCH WIDTH : Number of columns on the printer for a given pitch,
      i.e.:
      
           PICA=80
           ELITE=96
           Compressed=132
           Expanded=PITCH WIDTH/2
      
      Make sure you use the proper width with the corresponding pitch #!
      
       3.LEFT MARGIN : Number of blank  columns  on the left. You can have
      indented paragraphs  by   changing the left  margin with GRPH+l'x  '
      where 'x' is the new  margin (e.g., "[GRPH+l]12 "  will set the left
      margin at column 12). MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE NUMBER WITH A SPACE!
      
       4.RIGHT MARGIN  : number of  blank columns  on the right  (from the
      RIGHT edge of the paper,   NOT THE LEFT EDGE!:  e.g., a right margin
      of 10 will be at column 70 in a pica pitch). Also  "[GRPH+r]x ". See
      above.
      
              Note:   you  can  have  positive    or  negative   paragraph
      indentation  by just   changing the left and/or right margins before
      the  paragraph,   and resetting them   after.  E.g.: with  a default
      margin of 6, you  could set the left and right margins at  3 to have
      a negative indent of 3 in both the left and right.
      
       5.TOP MARGIN : number of blank lines at the top of the page.
      
       6.BOTTOM MARGIN : ditto for bottom.
      
       7.NUMBER    OF LINES PER PAGE:  normaly an  8&1/2"x11" sheet has 66
      lines; you can change this number to  print labels, envelopes,  etc.
      Change this number to  a large  one  (e.g., 999)  in order to  print
      continuously, without page breaks or page numbers.
      
           8.LINE  SPACING :    for single  or double  spaced (or more...)
      print-outs. Default is single.
      
       9.HEADER MARGIN :  the space between the header and the body of the
      text. Default is 4 lines. Set to 0 if not using a header.
      
      10.FOOTER MARGIN : the space between  the  body of  the text and the
      page number. Set this to 0 if not using page numbers.
      
      11.PAGE NUMBERING :  if  (N)o,  no page  numbers will be printed; if
      (Y)es, the page numbering  will start at page 1. If you are printing
      to RAM or  to the RS232 interface,  you  should probably set this to
      "N" if "paged" text is not necessary.
      
      12.HEADER : if (Y)es,  you will be prompted for a  header (make sure
      the length does not exceed the  pitch  width) and wether you want it
      centered or left or right justified.
      
      13.PAGE WAIT : (N)o for continuous paper, (Y)es for single sheets.
      
      14.JUSTIFY :  (Y)es if  you  want the text right  justified, (N)o  =
      ragged.

      Foreign character sets:
      -----------------------
      
              To use the foreign character sets of the  EPSON FX-80  refer
      to the charts in  the  printer  manual,  pages 72-73,   then use the
      following keys: #,$,@,[,],\,^,`,{,},|,~.
      E.g., if you need to print the german 'u umlaut', do the following:
        1)press [GRPH+,](to set the printer to print german characters)
        2)press "}" to print the 'u umlaut'.
      So you would type   "}ben"  (Ger.:to  exercise)  and "uben" would be
      printed  (with  the  two periods over the first  u).   What could be
      simpler?  To get  back  to the US set, press  [GRPH+@] . Then if you
      type "}" it will be printed as "}"!  The graphics characters are the
      FX-80 numbers which represent the foreign countries' character sets:
      0=US, 1=FR, 2=DL, 3=GB, 6=IT, 7=SP.
      
      
      Tabs:
      -----
      
              True tabs   are  supported,  at every  ninth column position
      from the left margin, as in the NEC's TEXT mode.  They can be  mixed
      with  bold,  italics,  etc. But be   aware  that if  you  use  right
      justification, the filling of the line with added spaces  may  shift
      the tabs out of position.
      
      
      Page breaks:
      ------------
      
              You may insert a  page break ( [GRPH+f] )  whenever you need
      a paragraph to start  on a new page, to prevent it from being  split
      between two pages.
      
      
      Backspace (overstrike):
      -----------------------
      
              By pressing [GRPH+h] you  can  generate   a backspace;  this
      enables you to    overstrike a letter:    e.g.,   the FX-80's french
      character set does not  contain  an "a" with  an "^" accent; you can
      print it with  the  following sequence:  type "a", press  [GRPH+h] ,
      type   "^". In  this    fashion   you can overstrike  any  number of
      characters. This  feature  only works if you are sending the text to
      the printer, NOT to Memory or RS232.
      
      
      Paragraph:
      ----------
      
              Pressing  [GRPH+p]   will   generate an  indentation  of   8
      characters on  the  first  line of a  paragraph (same  as a TAB) but
      will work with the right justification function.

      Conclusion:
      -----------
      
              A  compromise had to be made between efficiency, compactness
      and the number of   features. I  think  FORMAT.BA  includes the most
      needed   features in  a    formatter. The use of graphics characters
      embedded in the text makes  for  efficient and clean  looking  text,
      and it is easy to see where a command begins and/or ends.
