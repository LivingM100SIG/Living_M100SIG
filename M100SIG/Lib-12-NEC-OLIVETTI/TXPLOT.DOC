TXPLOT.NEC

     TEXT-PLOT will plot a formatted
 file on the LCD screen. Each character
 in the file is represented by a
 darkened pixel.

Note: because the number of pixel rows
      on an LCD screen is only 64,
      please format your TEXT so it is
      64 lines to a page.


      A file to be plotted must be
 formatted before it will appear on the
 LCD screen correctly.  This can be
 achieved with most of the commercially
 available text formatters that allow
 you to save a formatted file to RAM or
 with WORPRO in DL7.

     A TAB in the file always shows up
 as 8 blanks, so it should only be used
 for paragraph indentations.

    All other CTRL-codes below ASCII 32
 are ignored (they won't PLOT), except
 the CR/LF code which informs TxPlot to
 begin a new line.

     If NECly user wants the program
 adapted for use with both CRT&Disk
 Basic resident in RAM, please send me
 E-mail. ( Gerald K Tsui 74716,3557)

    The object code for an assembler is
 available upon request.
