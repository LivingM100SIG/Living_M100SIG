To use the SCROFF.BA program by Wilson Van Alst which is listed in the file
SLOLCD.THD in LIB 3 I made the following modification for the NEC 8201:

1 REM SCROLL OFF
2 CLEAR10,62300!
3 PRINTCHR$(27)"V"CHR$(27)"T";
4 POKE62300!,205:POKE62301!,107:POKE62302!,83:EXEC62300!

  end of listing

This allows full use of 1200/2400 baud modem by disabling LCD scrolling which
slows things down to a max of 650 baud.  Run this program and you will go right
into TELCOM.
