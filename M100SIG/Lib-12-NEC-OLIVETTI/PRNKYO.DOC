PRNKYO.DOC -- Documentation for PRNKYO
--------------------------------------

PRNKYO.BA is a Basic loader which loads a translated version of Jim
Irwins's PRN100.CO into the KC-85 (only!).  PRN100 is a popular
(approximately 1000 downloads) machine-language print processor for the
Model 100.  It has nifty features such as page plot, break, and display --
and will print at around one page per second to a printer (or buffer)
which can take that speed.

Using PRNPRT.BA (derived from PRN100.BAS -- see PRN100.MOD), you can
install your own customized printer codes for things like underline,
boldface, superscript, etc.

Full documentation will be found in the various PRN100 files in DL2
(especially PRN100.DOC & PRN100.MOD); however, DO NOT try to use any of
the patch files there with this KC-85 version.  Here I will mention only
those things which are unique to this version.

1. Loading PRNKYO.CO

PRNKYO.BA is a Basic program which installs PRNKYO.CO on your menu.  It
will load it wherever you want in memory (below MAXRAM).  The default is
under any existing M/L programs you have in memory -- or MAXRAM, if there
are none.  If you load it just under MAXRAM, the addresses in PRN100.DOC &
PRN100.DOC (DL2) will be correct; otherwise, all addresses must be
translated downward accordingly.

When you get done, you will have a fully functioning version of PRN100 for
the KC-85.

2. Adding Printer Codes

The companion program PRNPRT.BA will add printer codes.  It is PRN100.BAS,
modified to accommodate the relocatable nature of PRNKYO.CO.  The
documentation of PRN100.MOD applies -- except that the addresses will be
lower in a relocated version.  There is a ROM call in this program, so do
not attempt to use it with a Model 100 version of PRN100!

3. Support

Please ask me any and all questions about getting this going, installing
printer codes -- and any apparent problems or bugs.

This will be the introduction to machine language programs and their
"unique features" for many KC-85 users.  Be sure to ask me or the Sysops
any questions you may have about the care and feeding of M/L programs.
Mainly, make a copy of all stuff in your computer before starting out to
install PRNKYO.CO.

Finally, some acknowledgements -- to Darbi Henderson who loaned me her
KC-85 yesterday so I could do this, to Jim Irwin for help in understanding
my disassembly of his code in PRN100, and to Onset Corp who are making me
a longer term loan of a KC-85 for further work (e.g., DSKMGR.KYO so KC-85
owners can use the Tandy Disk Drive, versions 1 or 2).
