Documentation for UTLKY1.BA, UTLKY2.BA and UTLKY3.BA
----------------------------------------------------

UTLKY1.BA thru UTLKY3.BA are function key driven utilities for the Kyo-85
(ONLY!).  UTLKY1.BA is the full program and the other two are smaller,
reduced-capability subsets.  The full version is described here.

When you run UTLKY1.BA from your KC-85 menu, you will see eight function
key labels, as follows:

1) Name -- facilitates renaming programs on the KC-85 menu

2) Kill -- makes killing programs much easier, and stuffs the keyboard
   buffer to let you kill BA files and stay in the program

3) Dir -- gives you a directory of all files in the computer, including
   the paste buffer and memory reserved for loaded CO programs; see
   FILEN.DOC (DL7) for interpretation of the output

4) Adrs -- enters the ADDRSS function (in the Kyo ROM but not on the
   menu); must have a file named ADRS.DO on the menu to use this

5) Schd -- enters the SCHEDL function; must have NOTE.DO on the menu to
   use this capability

6) Pset -- provides set-up capability for Epson printers (program can be
   edited to change the limited selection offered)

7) Lnfd -- toggles the built-in code to add line feeds to printers that
   need them (e.g., an Epson that you also use with an IBM-type computer).
   If you have been using LFEED.KYO, disable it and use this one (if you
   are using this program)

8) Menu -- returns you to the KC-85 main menu.  Hitting <ENTER> key will
   do the same.

At any level of the program, hitting <ENTER> will take you up one level in
the menus.

Compared to the above, UTLKY2.BA is lacking the Pset function, and
UTLKY3.BA has both Pset and Lnfd removed -- for users of other printers.
Starting with UTLKY1.BA, you can mix and match on your own.
