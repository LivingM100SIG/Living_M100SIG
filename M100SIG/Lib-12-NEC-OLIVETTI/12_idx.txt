  This is ADV.100 from XA3, modified to run on the NEC PC-8201. CAUTION: This
  is
  only the game itself; you also need the game text, available in XA3 as
  ADV0,1, 2,3 and 4. SECOND CAUTION: All this requires over 30K of memory (but
  it's worth
  it!) Strongly advise reading ADV.DOC in XA3 FIRST, then downloading the text
  files, then back here for this program. Runs in 5443 bytes, including 4 REM
  lines. Checksum 439,286.

  Adapted from "Loan amortization version 2.0" by Jim Gerritz & Phil Estrem
  in DL2, this improved version of AMORTZ prompts for number of days from
  closing to end-of-period, and if input prints a first "interest-only"
  payment, then your schedule. Double precision is now used for interest,
  principal and balance, for accuracy with large numbers.

  This is a neat little program that works on the Olivetti M10, NEC, and RS
  Mod 100. It's nothing great, but kind of cute. The program produces a
  changing screen with BOXES. Try it out today! Takes only 10 seconds to
  download (really!). Put on some nice music, then RUN this program. I find it
  fascinating to just watch the boxes form and then un-form. Try it! I think
  you'll like it!

  In recent months a new member (?) of the Model 100 family has appeared,
  the Kyotronic 85 (or Kyo 85) made by Kyosei in Japan.  It looks a lot like
  a Model 100 (even more so than does the Olly M10 or the NEC 8201).  But it
  is very incompatible.  An earlier file (KYO85.INF, DL 13) captured messages
  re this computer and compatibility issues.  This file continues the story,
  and focusses on the possibility of changing the ROM to a M100 ROM.
