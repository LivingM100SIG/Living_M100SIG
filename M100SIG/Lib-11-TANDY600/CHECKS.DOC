
	CHECKS.600 v 2.3 is considerably enhanced from the earlier version
that became available in early 1986. Not only have sloppy buggettes been
removed, but both the screen display (List) and hard copy (Print) sections are
improved significantly. Major new features are the inclusion of a monetary
total of all checks reported in List and Print sections, and the important
"wildcard" search features.

	Note that the program REQUIRES the installation of DBCALLS.LIB in
active RAM as well as CHECKS.DAT and CHECKS.FIL in a specific format. Highly
recommend that the files be downloaded from the database here and users use
them to become familiar with the program. Then their data may be deleted and
user's own checks may be recorded.


1) Enter checks section:
   
   This section is rather obvious; major change that needs to be mentioned,
since the screen doesn't, is that pressing ENTER at a field prompt aborts the
process and returns user to the main menu. Lower right portion of the screen
keeps track of the total amount of money recorded during current session.


2) Sort records section:
   
   Not having run up hundreds of checks in this program, I've no idea how long
it takes to sort a lot of checks. In testing, it seems blinding fast which
means the user will be in and out of here very quickly. Any of the fields can
be sorted upon which permits printing of reports in any sequence desired.
CAUTION: if sorting upon the "Date" field, months come first. Thus, March '87
will be listed before April '86.


3) Find checks section:
   
   The "Find" section displays results to the screen. First prompt asks if the
user wants to see all the checks recorded. If so, then all information on every
check recorded will be displayed, ten checks at a time. Total number of checks
shown and their dollar total is reported at the end of display.
   
   User may select field to search and have only those items displayed that are
selected. In this mode, the "Number" and "Amount" fields will show EXACT matchs
only. However, "Date", "Payee", and "Purpose" fields are not case sensitive
and, more importantly, may be searched with use of wildcards. User may choose
to end every "Purpose" entry with an "X" for tax purposes and then get a print
out of those checks by selecting "Purpose" field and asking for *X as the word
to search for.
   
       Searching the "Date" field offers various possibilities. Responding in
the manner shown to "search for" prompt has indicated results.

        02*     -  lists checks dated in February.
        ??02*   -  lists checks dated the second day of every month/year
        *02*    -  rather useless; both Februarys and second days
        *87     -  lists checks dated in 1987
        03*87   -  lists checks dated in March '87
        03??87  -  lists checks dated in March '87
   
   Iteration: no matter what field is selected, the monetary total for the
checks reported will be reported at the end of the display.


4) Print records section:

   This section, after preliminary advisory, operates in precisely the same
manner as the "List" section described above. Fifty-four checks are listed
per page, with totals at the end of the report just as with screen display.

   Printing requires a parallel printer; send me a disk with SASE if you need
the program converted for serial printer use.


5) Delete records section:

   The check number MUST be known in order to use this section. Give the check
number when prompted and all record of that check will be deleted.


6) Exit program - does just that.
