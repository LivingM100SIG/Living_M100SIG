      Dear Mr. Ringley:

      Per your January 18, 1990 letter,  we  have  been  instructed  by
      management that you should contact the store  for  a  replacement
      diskette on your Model 600 and  have  them  call  Tandy  Software
      Assembly and ask for Orville Sewell.

      This information has been in the Store Operating Manual for years
      and  our  store  personnel  should  have  done   this   for   you
      automatically.

      If I can be of any further service please contact me.

      Very truly yours,
