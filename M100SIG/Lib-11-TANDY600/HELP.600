The BASIC ROM chip may be ordered from Tandy's National Parts Center, (800)
424-2425.  You can also order it through your local Radio Shack store, but be
prepared to wait.  Some users report long delays in obtaining it.  Some mail-
order dealers who also carry Tandy/Radio Shack computers may have it in stock,
but finding them involves extensive calling around to locate a dealer who has
one.  Once you obtain the ROM chip, you can copy it onto disk, and thereafter,
reload it into RAM from the disk, providing you have sufficient RAM space for
it to operate in.  Once copied to disk, you don't need the ROM chip any longer,
and you can remove it and replace the MSPLAN ROM if you wish, loading BASIC
from the disk whenever you need it.  If you cannot obtain a ROM chip, perhaps
you can borrow one.

Programs and information for the 600 are all stored here in Library 11.  To
create yourself a catalog of all the files and programs here, use the command
SCA DES.  Read through all the tip files for operating suggestions, and hints
from previous users, before you start downloading programs.  Make sure your
terminal defaults are set correctly to support the 600; read DEFALT.HLP in
Library 1, and GO PROFILE to set your terminal profile accordingly.  You will
get very little support on the message board, since there are currently very
few 600 owners who drop by on a regular basis.  If you have access to a PC or
PC compatible computer, download the file CAT-11.ARC and de-ARC it to obtain a
catalog of all files in this library.

Memory upgrades are sold by American Cryptronics in California, (714) 540-1174,
and Purple Computing in Oregon, (800) 732-5012.

Easyware Products in Texas runs a subscription BBS and publishes a newsletter
for 600 users, and sells software for the 600. Write Box 218778, Houston TX,
77218 for information.  Include a large, self-addressed and stamped envelope
(#10 or larger), with 75 cents postage on it.

As of the upload date of this file, there are no sources of commercial software
or support for the 600.  The only programs you will find are those on services
such as CompuServe, GEnie, or Delphi, and local BBS's around the country.  We
do not maintain a list of such BBS's since they are generally privately owned
and run, and are subject to on-again, off-again service, depending on the whims
of the folks who run them.

600 disks may be readable on MS-DOS machines; see the files 600TO.LT,
ADIDAS.NET and MANZ.THD

If you are having problems with TELCOM, read the file TELCOM.CAT which offers
comparative descriptions of all files in this library which relate to the
TELCOM program. -- Having a "garbage problem" when you sign on?  See the files
LOGON.TIP and 600TIP.003. - For downloading instructions, see TEL004.600.

There have been many messages which offered substantial advice to 600 users,
and which have been saved as thread files for the benefit of new users.  The
file THD-11.CAT lists the thread files.
