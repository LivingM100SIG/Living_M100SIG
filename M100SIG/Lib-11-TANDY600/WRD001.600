PRINT FORMATTING ON THE TANDY 600

The Tandy 600 portable computer Owner's Manual does not mention how to send
formatting codes to the printer; i.e., underlining, changing fonts, etc.  Yet
that does not mean that it cannot be done.  I have found an easy way to send
any code (including ESCape sequences to most printers) with any Tandy 600
built-in application.  All you need is your printer manual and Appendix D --
ASCII Character Codes from the Tandy 600 Owner's Manual.  For the purposes of
this document, I will talk about sending codes to an Epson printer.  This
method has also been used successfully on an IBM Proprinter, and with limited
success on the CGP-220 Ink Jet printer.

Sending non-ESCape codes to any printer is very easy.  If you want the printer
switched to the compressed mode, for example, look in your printer manual for
the code.  It can be in either decimal or hexadecimal.  The code for Epson
printers is decimal 15.  Now looking in Appendix D of the 600 manual, the Key
Top Character for decimal 15 is CTRL-O (the letter O, not the number zero.) 
Keep in mind that case is significant, so press the CAPS LOCK key for a capital
O.  Pressing CTRL-O with the CAPS LOCK on does not produce the same code as
pressing SHIFT-CTRL-o, so make sure and use the CAPS LOCK key.  Wherever you
want the printer in the compressed mode, press CTRL-O.  You will see a "star"
symbol on the screen, but it will not be printed.  The code for turning off the
compressed mode is decimal 18, which translates to CTRL-R.  Pressing CTRL-R
produces an "up-down arrow" on the screen.  That's all there is to it.

Sending ESCape code sequences are a little more complicated, but not much.  As
you know, the ESCape key on the Tandy 600 stops whatever you are doing and
sends the cursor to the menu line.  Therefore, you cannot just press the ESCape
key to send an ESCape code to the printer.  The code for ESCape is decimal 27.
I have found that an ESCape code can be sent to most printers by adding decimal
128 to the decimal 27, producing decimal 155.  Decimal code 155 is produced by
pressing SHIFT-ALT-4.  While holding down the SHIFT and ALT keys, press the
number four key on the top row of the keyboard.  The symbol produced on the
screen is the cent sign.  Then you can follow this by whatever other codes are
necessary to get the job done.  Turning  on underlining with the Epson printer,
for example, is accomplished with ESC-hyphen-1.  To do that with the Tandy 600,
type SHIFT-ALT-4, then the hyphen, then the number one.  You will see the cent
sign followed by the hyphen and the number one on the screen, yet they will not
be printed.  Turning off underlining is ESC-hyphen-0, so you type SHIFT-ALT-4,
then the hyphen, then the number zero.  I was able to produce all 160 different
typestyles with the Epson printer using my Tandy 600.

This method of sending ESCape codes does not work with my CGP-220 Ink Jet
printer.  Apparently it does not like the decimal 155 for the ESCape code.  You
will just have to try this method and see if it will work with your particular
printer.  As I said earlier, it does work for Epson and IBM printers.

By the way, these codes work with all built-in applications, not just Word.  It
is very useful to turn on the compressed mode for spreadsheet applications
under Plan, for example.

The only drawback I have found is that these codes take up space on the screen,
which can upset your margins.  For example, to start and stop underlining on
one line takes a total of six characters.  Even though those six characters
will not be printed, they probably have caused the last word on the line to be
wrapped to the next line, leaving a right margin that is more ragged than
usual.  This problem will essentially prevent you from justifying any paragraph
which has one of these extended print formatting sequences.  

If you are changing print pitch (i.e., going from pica to expanded, compressed,
or elite), you might want to put the codes on the line prior to the line where
you want the codes to take effect.

The problem is a little more severe in Plan.  Since the printer does not print
those formatting codes, the cells that are to the right of print formatting
codes do not line up with the rest of the columns.  A little trial-and-error
experimenting with moving the text further to the right within a cell will line
up everything when it is printed.

In conclusion, you can send nearly any code that you choose to the printer. 
You can underline, boldface, or change the pitch.  Even though Tandy decided
not to put the fullest or latest implementation of Microsoft Word into the
Tandy 600, I think that it is an excellent word processor for a portable
computer.  It is not just another text editor.
