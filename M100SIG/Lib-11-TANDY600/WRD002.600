              CREATING ASCII TEXT FILES FOR UPLOAD TO COMPUSERVE


     CompuServe accepts text input of up to 79 characters per line both on the
message board and in the Data Libraries.  Formatting messages or .DOC files for
the DLs using Tandy 600 WORD is simply a matter of setting the page width to 79
characters and the page length to 1 line as follows:


FORMAT DOCUMENT page width: 79                          page length: 1
            margin top: 0      bottom: 0          left: 0     right: 0
            page numbers: Yes(No)         start at: 1


To Print the document to an Text file, set the following parameters:


PRINT to: filename.ext   formatted:(Yes)No       copies: 1
         range:(All)Selection Pages         page numbers:


Tabs, line indents and centered lines will be "printed" using spaces, so
there's no need to worry about different Tab settings on the editor to which
you're uploading.

               Using this  document  format,  you  can  still  FORMAT
          PARAGRAPH  individual  paragraphs  within  your   specified
          format.    For  instance,  this  paragraph,  besides  being
          Justified, uses a LEFT & RIGHT INDENT of 10 to set  it  off
          within the  document.    Be  sure,  if  you  are  preparing
          Messages for upload to CompuServe via the SIG Editor,  that
          you specify SPACE BEFORE & AFTER as 0 and LINE  SPACING  as
          1, since the SIG Editor interprets blank lines as  "end  of
          message."   If you are using the FILGE editor, then  that's
          not a consideration since only the line "/exit" can end the
          message.  If you want to  preserve  any  lines  exactly  as
          written without the editor reformatting them,  rather  than
          specifying SU (Save Unformatted) at the end of the  upload,
          insert a  period  as  the  first  character  of  each  line
          (including blank lines).  Be sure to work from the  top  of
          the file down.  If a long file, temporarily  changing  your
          editor to FILGE might be preferable.

               When you Print the file to a Text  file,  even  though
          your page length is set at 1 line,  the  paragraph  formats
          will be preserved.

                                      You
                            could even create very
                      odd-looking paragraph formats, such
                  as circles or even Christmas trees (I'm not
                trying to make any hints as to this  SIG  come
                December.)  This particular one  -- actually a
                 series of one-line paragraphs -- was created
                    by simply formatting this paragraph as
                      "centered" and pressing ENTER when
                          each line reached the width
                              I was looking for.
                                    Simple?

     Of course, try to keep in mind the interests of those who will be reading
the messages.  Some may want to reformat the file you uploaded with wide left
margins so that they can punch holes for inclusion in notebooks.  Justification
results in extra spaces being inserted toward the right margin which would make
reformatting to a narrower column extremely tedious.  So a format similar to
this paragraph, using a Left alignment and not justified, would seem the most
considerate.

     At 300 Baud you can upload messages directly from text files created with
WORD.  The upload may get a bit ahead of the editor and seem jumbled, but if
you Preview the resulting upload you'll see that the CIS editor straightened it
out.  At faster Baud rates you'll get hopelessly ahead of the editor, which
will likely go haywire.  To send the file use the TRANSFER SEND option in
TELCOM, being sure to specify "None" in the Protocol field.


                          CREATING A BOILERPLATE FILE


     You can easily create a boilerplate file which contains the formatting
information you use to send messages or .DOC files to CompuServe.  Create a new
WORD file named "MSG" and Format Document as described above.  You may want
different paragraph formats; for instance in the example below (I use equal
signs to represent paragraph markers because WORD doesn't allow you to print
CTRL-T and who knows what CompuServe would make of it anyway) the first
paragraph -- for salutations -- is aligned Left with no indents.  The second is
aligned left with a first line indent of 5, for normal paragraphs.  You might
place your normal closing, including your name or handle, as the last line.
When you have finished, be sure that none of the WORD options at the bottom of
the screen are highlighted (i.e. you're in the Edit mode) and that the cursor
rests on the first paragraph marker so that you'll be immediately ready to
enter text.  Example:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=
     =
                                   Cheers,   --jam=










> Copy Delete Edit Format Insert Jump Merge Options Print Replace Search
Edit document or press Esc to use menu
Word: MSG       {}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     With, remember, the cursor on the first paragraph marker.

     Press CTRL-F10 to get back to the System Manager Menu.  Put the cursor on
MSG.WRD and press "N", then TAB.  I've adopted the convention of starting all
my boilerplate filenames with an apostrophe and not using an extension (that
leaves them at the bottom of the Menu screen, out of the way).  Type the
filename.ext you want, 'MSG to follow this convention, or perhaps #CIS or
C.BLR, and press ENTER.  Unless you used the .WRD extension, your boilerplate
is no longer listed as a WORD file.

     To use your boilerplate, simply COPY the boilerplate to ????????.WRD, put
the Menu cursor on ????????.WRD, press ENTER and type in and edit your text.
PRINT the file to a Text file and that Text file is ready for uploading to
CompuServe.  If you've got Basic for your 600, you can Delete the .WRD file and
peruse the Text file with BROWSE.600 (in DL0) to double-check it, if you wish.


                         "STYLESHEETS" & "GLOSSARIES"


     For users of desktop Microsoft WORD, such boilerplates can be viewed as a
combination of Stylesheets and Glossaries.  You can include headings containing
your address and phone number, for example, which precludes you from accidently
typing (especially the latter) erroneously.  In fact, you can create
"Stylesheets" of paragraph and tab formats and "Glossaries" of often-used (or
mispelled) terms, names, addresses or even paragraphs!

     Setting up a "Stylesheet" entails creating a new WORD document
(STYLE.WRD?) in which you create various paragraph/tab formats, perhaps naming
them.  Using CTRL-F9 to jump back and forth from the document you're typing,
you just COPY the paragraph marker you want to the SCRAP and INSERT it (F2)
into your document.  Following the tips given in WRD001.600 (in DL0 here) you
may be able to create printer control codes which could be COPYed into your
document, but that is dependent upon which printer you have.

     "Glossaries" entail creating Text files (PRINTing them from WORD), naming
them mnemonically, again using some kind of convention (perhaps this time
simply not having an extension or beginning with an exclamation mark), and
MERGEing them into your document.  This seems faster than creating a
GLOSSARY.WRD file and COPYing information from there into your document.  If,
however, you want to retain the format as well as the content of a Paragraph,
then creating a GLOSSARY.WRD file would be preferable.

     Of course, since the operating system of the Tandy 600, Microsoft Works,
is an integrated environment, you have the additional ability to easily copy
data from your FILE database or (MULTI)PLAN spreadsheet or CALENDAR programs
into your document.


     Further tips:

     To prevent the screen shifting right and jumping back when you reach the
end of lines, you may prefer to set the page width to 75 characters or less.

     If you have saved your Text file to a filename without extension and
deleted the original .WRD file and then you decide to re-edit it, you cannot
Run application: WORD    file: FILENAME.  You could rename the file to add an
extension and later Format Document to 1-line pages, but it might be quicker to
COPY your boilerplate to a new WORD file and then MERGE from: FILENAME.

     To "automate" your uploads even more, you can use the advice given in
MESSAG.HLP in DL0 and create a first line such as:

L;Dave Thomas 76703,446;Tandy 600 Help

which would 'L`eave a message to Sysop ^Dave^ (be sure to include the PPN,
otherwise your message won't be flagged for the recipient) on the subject of
Tandy 600 Help.  You can also add as the last line "S#" (for 'S`tore
message/Section #) after the blank line or "/exit" line ending the document,
which will automatically store the document.  If you have Tandy 600 Basic then
for quick messages online or those not likely to require extensive editing,
MESSGE.600 in DL1 should prove faster.

Or you might type the following:

re;1234567

which would 'RE`ply to message number 1234567 (you don't have to give the
recipient's PPN or subject for replies).  Since the Section # is also in the
previous message, you need only specify S after the blank or /exit line.  Read
MESSAG.HLP for many more useful tips.  Similarly, you can at least partially
automate uploads to the Data Libraries; read UPLOAD.HLP, also in DL0, for that
information.

     When uploading Text files to the Data Libraries or EasyPlex, you could
send the file using XMODEM protocol rather than without protocol.  It will
still be a Readable ASCII text file.


     Hope that I've gotten you into a mind to explore the capabilities of your
Tandy 600; and if you chance upon any undocumented features or, for instance,
create a Printer Contol Code "stylesheet" for your printer, please upload a
"tip" file to the DLs.
