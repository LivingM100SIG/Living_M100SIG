   If you inherit a long document with line feeds after every line, but they 
are not where you want them for a re-shaping of the document, here is one 
method of removing line feeds (or pi signs) from a document, Tandy 600 
Portable.
   1.If you wish to retain paragraphs, while stripping all other line feeds, 
go through the document and mark the beginning of each paragraph with a 
symbol such as a triangle. The keys for this are CTRL+P. This will provide 
a marker which will not be stripped, so that you can re-insert the paragraphs 
later. (I just found out that that triangle produces a line feed in the Forum 
editor).
   2.Starting with a file in word, Copy it to a disk file. 
   3.Verify successful copy by Copying the disk file to Console for a breif 
inspection. You should see symbols before the text appears.
   4.Delete the original Word file if you need the space.
   5.Open a new Word file.
   6.Merge the Disk file into this new Word file. This should produce about 
60 to 80 lines of symbols and spaces, followed by the text. The text appears 
stripped of all formatting except spaces.
   7.Find the beginning of the original text, and place the cursor there. 
Ignore spurious repetitions of the text mixed in with the symbols.
   8. Press F6 to enable extend. Press the left arrow and hold it to block in 
the area from the start of the text to the left end of the display. Then 
press and hold the up arrow to block in the entire display of symbols, all 
the way back to the start.
   9. Press ESC, then D to delete the symbols. You will need 5000 bytes or 
more available to do this in one shot. Otherwise, do steps 8 and 9 in two or 
more sections, removing the symbols in blocks at a time. Delete SCRAP later. 

   You now have a document in Word stripped of all previous formatting except 
spaces, which you may now re-format however you choose, using ESC,F,D.
   (This file now has the normal Word formatting, like any word file, which 
is now holding it in whatever position you choose) 

   For short documents it may be simpler to just run the cursor down the left 
side of the display and press DEL at each line.
