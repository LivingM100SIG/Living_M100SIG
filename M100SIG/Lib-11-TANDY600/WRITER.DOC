
Documentation for WRITER.600, a program created for CodeWorks Magazine.
  Tandy 600 version adapted from WRITER.BAS by Dave Thomas

     "Writer is a program that takes a critical look at the mechanics of your
writing.  It knows nothing about the context of your writing, but can look at
sentence length, use of punctuation, unique word usage and other quantifyable
attributes.  With it, you can check your own or anyone else's writing
mechanics." - CodeWorks, Issue #1, p. 17

     Upon first use of the program, Option 1 must be used to enter new
text and save to RAM or disk. Text to be analyzed must always be typed in from
WRITER program control in order for it to be properly formatted and line count made in the manner needed for processing. Preparation instructions are provided
by the program before you start typing in your textual material. The text must
be no less than 100 words and no more than 300, or about 600 to 1800 bytes.

     Once a file has been prepared, the analysis may proceed immediately or
the file may be recalled for later evaluation after preparing other files.

     Whilst analysing textual material, the program keeps you informed of
progress with advisory comment and, during final calculations, by printing
plus signs indicating progress rather than lock-up.
