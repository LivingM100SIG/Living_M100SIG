  Care of and replacement of NiCads are a topic of special interest to
  Tandy 600 owners -- since that computer comes with a built in battery pack.
  These messages discuss operation of the NiCads -- and give a recipe for
  rebuilding a spent battery pack by replacing the individual cells.  A chance
  to save some $$$, if you have the skills (and daring!) required.
  Otherwise, information on ordering a new battery pack is also given.

  This is a non-.WRD version of ZPCHAR.WRD, which can be downloaded by Model
  100/ 102/200 and other users.  The characters you see and keystrokes to get
  them  won't be the same as what I saw when I wrote the file, but it may be
  of  interest to some.  This can be downloaded with either buffer capture or
  XMODEM, but be sure to use 8 data bits, not 7.  If you use  seven data bits,
  you'll get the standand character set! Enjoy! Steve Zimmerman 73226,3504
