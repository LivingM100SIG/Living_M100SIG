CompuServe Model 100 SIG file: TEL004.600

       File transfers with the Tandy 600 to/from CompuServe Data Libraries
are covered in this file. Prior to attempting any use of the fine XMODEM
protocol transfer capability, it is essential that user's CompuServe DEFALT
be set up with 8 bit, zero parity as described in TEL001.600 file in DL 1.
Note that these instructions cover transfers in any SIG/Forum and Public Access
on CompuServe but would need mild modification for use in the Personal File
Area, for which see PERFIL.HLP in DL 0.

   1) Introduction:
       It is highly recommended that users dispense with the Data Library menu
system as rapidly as possible. These instructions are based on the assumption
that the member will be operating without the menu, at least in the database.
The "User Options Menu", accessed from the Function Menu, allows selection of
"1 (MEN) Use menus [No]" and "2 (BR) Use brief prompts [Yes]" which is known
as "expert mode" and is recommended for ease of Data Library use. However, if
expert mode has not been pre-selected from the Options Menu, the same result
may be obtained on a temporary basis by use of "SET NO MENU" command entered
in any of the SIG's Data Libraries. That is, upon arrival in the Data Library
and being shown the list of commands that ends with:
 "Enter selection or H for help:" just type the words "SET NO MENU" and press
the ENTER key. The result will be that you'll then have a "DL 1:" prompt, or
whatever numbered Data Library you've entered.
       The remainder of this file assumes that commands will be entered at
the "DL n:" prompt, though the same result would be obtained if the DL Menu
was totally ignored and commands were entered at ".... H for help:" prompt.
 
   2) No protocol, plain transfer:
       This method should be used ONLY for textual material such as this file
and other documentation. It MAY be used for Basic program transfers IF they
are in ASCII format, but it is not recommended. This method MUST NOT be used
for transfer of ready to run BASIC 600 programs. Such programs include those
with a double file length listing in the Data Library, like 12345(9876), that
generally have BIN among the keywords, as well as programs in member's
Tandy 600 with the .BAS extension. Repeat: do NOT use no protocol transfer for
BASIC programs.
 
       a) Downloading:
          Often misunderstood, downloading refers to the transfer of files
FROM CompuServe TO your Tandy 600 or other computer. Specifically for the
Tandy 600, the simplest procedure is as follows, using this file as example.
          (1) At the DL n: prompt, type the <R>ead command and filename.ext;
thus: R TEL004.600  - do NOT press ENTER at this point.
          (2) On your Tandy 600, press the F3 key. "Cp" will appear on line 16
of your screen near F8 marker.
          (3) Now press ENTER. The command typed in (1) will take effect and
CompuServe will proceed to send the file to your computer.
          (4) When the end of the file has been reached (which will be obvious)
press the F3 key again and the "Cp" will disappear.
          (5) The file just <R>ead will now be in your SESSION.TXT, or whatever
file you set up as default with your "Options" command in Telcom.
          (6) Offline you may now load the file to WORD by placing System
Manager's cursor over the filename, pressing ENTER, and responding to "RUN
application:" prompt with WORD and pressing ENTER again. In WORD, the file may
be edited, copied to disk, and printed as desired. [This may also be done while
still connected and online, but watch the clock and $$$ tick off!!]
          (7) Note that it is entirely acceptable to download more than one
file to SESSION.TXT during one online connection. The additional files will be
appended, they won't overwrite the first file. Then when offline the files may
be separated into their proper parts using the WORD editing capability.
 
       b) Uploading:
          Clarifying again, the term uploading refers to transfer of files
FROM your computer TO CompuServe's Data Libraries or message board. The method
described in this paragraph should be used only for textual material in ASCII
format and NOT for programs.
          (1) Files to be uploaded may be prepared with the Tandy 600's WORD
application, but should NOT be uploaded as .WRD files. After preparation of
the file in WORD, <P>rint it to a .TXT file with "formatted NO" option. Prior
to <P>rinting, <F>ormat <D>ocument should have been used to set up file with
page width of 79.
          (2) Arriving in the SIG's Data Library use the UPL command at the
DL n: prompt thus: UPL THISUN.TXT/PROTO:CAPTURE and press ENTER.
          (3) At the query concerning prompt desired, just respond with NO and
you will be advised to start the transfer and to send CTRL-Z when completed.
          (4) Now press SHIFT-ESC on your Tandy 600 which will take you to the
Telcom command line.
          (5) Select <T>ransfer
          (6) Select "Send" by use of <spacebar> and press ENTER
          (7) Type the filename, THISFILE.TXT in the "TRANSFER SEND from" field
          (8) Press TAB to move to the protocol field, use <spacebar> to select
the "(None)" option.
          (9) Now press ENTER. Upon completion of the file transfer, the
Tandy 600 will return to the Telcom command line. Select "Connect" and then
press CTRL-Z in order to close the file in the Data Library. Respond to the
Keyword and Description prompts in the manner described in UPLOAD.HLP.
 
   3) XMODEM protocol transfers:
       This is the preferred method for ALL file transfers to/from the Data
Library and Personal File Area and MUST be used for transfer of programs for
the Tandy 600. Though the non-protocol transfer method described above may be
used, with slight modification, on the message board, XMODEM transfers may NOT
be used on the message board (except in the EasyPlex area.)
 
       a) Downloading:
          (1) Binary transfers --- used for .BAS programs. Normally programs
for the Tandy 600 in Basic have a .600 extension, BIN among the Keywords, and
have double number file length listings; 8765(789) type of notation.
             (a) Type DOW command at the "DL n:" prompt with the syntax:
 DOW THATFILE.600/PROTO:XMODEM/TYPE:BIN and press ENTER
             (b) Press SHIFT-ESC on Tandy 600 to access Telcom commands.
             (c) Press <T>ransfer
             (d) Use <spacebar> to select "Receive" and press ENTER
             (e) Type THATFILE.BAS in "TRANSFER RECEIVE to" field; note that
the .BAS extension is important in order to receive the program in a ready to
run format.
             (f) Press TAB to move cursor to protocol field.
             (g) Press <spacebar> to select "(Xmodem)" option.
             (h) Press ENTER. After a bit of "Waiting" whilst your computer
and CompuServe shake hands, a report on blocks (128 bytes) received will show
until transfer completed. An occasional "Waiting" may show up when a squirrel
chews on the phone line, but transfer is likely to resume.
             (i) When transfer is completed, the Telcom command line will
return; "Connect" should be selected and then ENTER pressed.
             (j) Press ENTER to notify CompuServe that transfer is completed
and to return to the "DL n:" prompt.
 
          (3) ASCII text transfers:
               This method is best to use when downloading a Basic program that
has been prepared for a Model 100 or Tandy 200 and is not in binary format.
Also for use in error checking transfer of any documentation.
              (a) Procedure is identical to binary except for the command
given to CompuServe at the DL n: prompt and the filename given for Tandy 600.
              (b) Syntax for the DOW command:
 DOW THATUN.DOC/PROTO:XMODEM/TYPE:ASCII
              (c) Filename extension for the Tandy 600 may be .BAS if it is
a Basic program that will run without modification; not likely but possible.
Best is to use the extension of .TXT on any ASCII file and then load into WORD
as described above for editing. If a Basic program, it may then be <P>rinted
in unformatted mode to .BAS file and loaded to Basic.
 
       b) Uploading
          (1) Binary transfers - again the method to use for any .BAS
file in your Tandy 600.
              (a) Similar in every way to uploading as described above,
the differences will be clarified.
              (b) At the DL n: prompt, type the command with syntax:
 UPL THISUN.600/PROTO:XMODEM/TYPE:BIN and press ENTER.
              (c) Filename in "TRANSFER SEND from:" field should be the
Basic program you have ready, such as THISUN.BAS
              (d) Select "(Xmodem)" as protocol
              (e) "Waiting" message and block transfer report will be
just like that in XMODEM downloading.
              (f) When transfer complete, "Connect" and press ENTER to
notify CompuServe of completion and then respond to Keyword and Description
prompts as described in UPLOAD.HLP in DL 0.


          (2) ASCII text transfers - for documentation; no Tandy 600
program should be uploaded as an ASCII file.
              (a) Procedure is identical to that explained above except
that the command syntax is: UPL THUSIT.DOC/PROTO:XMODEM/TYPE:ASCII
              (b) Most likely filename extension for "TRANSFER SEND
from:" field would be .TXT since .WRD files should NOT be uploaded to Data
Library.
