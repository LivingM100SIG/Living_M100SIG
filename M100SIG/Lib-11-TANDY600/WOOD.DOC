
Documentation for WOOD.600, a program from CodeWorks Magazine.
  Adapted for the Tandy 600 by Dave Thomas

	In their Jan/Feb 1986 issue of CodeWorks, the Editors devoted eight
full pages to discussion of the planning and programming that went into this
program. Recommend that folks interested in the program technicalities obtain
a copy of the magazine by addressing CodeWorks at the address given in REM
at the beginning of the program.

	The WOOD.600 program solves the very complicated problem of trying to
cut expensive plywood in the most effective way to waste the least wood. With
complicated problems, it will keep trying (Attempt--> nn) until it can find
either a "Satisfactory" or "a POOR" solution. In very rare cases the program
will proclaim an "EXCELLENT solution!"
	After printing detailed results and cutting procedures to the screen,
the program provides an opportunity to print further instructions, diagrams,
and results to the printer.

	Since I'm neither a programmer nor a carpenter, I took the simple way
of testing the program to make sure all was well. First I had the program cut
up the base 96 x 48 sheet of plywood in three pieces. No problem. Then, not
wishing to guess about something I knew nothing about (cabinet making),
I measured a china cupboard and a computer desk module and had the program
figure the best cuts to get the pieces needed for those bits of furniture.
In both cases, the program came up with solutions quickly and then reported
the size of the pieces remaining after cutting the needed boards. For you to
see how the program works, I'm including those test inputs below.

	After initialzation, the program asks for the "kerf" of your saw. This
allows it to adjust for the loss of wood due to the saw's action. Then you are
prompted for LENGTH, WIDTH, and GRAIN for each needed piece. Naturally t'is
expected that the program user will have cabinet blueprints prior to running
the program. The GRAIN prompt is looking for one of two responses: "1" would
mean that you want the grain to run the length of the piece, whilst "2" would
indicate grain running the width of the piece. Type a zero (0) at the LENGTH
prompt to cease input and allow the program to start calculations.
Note that the "Press ESC to quit, ENTER to continue" prompt provides for a
tidy exit to System Manager with ESC whilst ENTER takes you to the next screen.

	The screen and printer reports both use "Cut codes" to indicate the
type of cutting required. These are deciphered as follows:
   Cut code 1 - exact fit
   Cut code 2 - one cut, horizontally
   Cut code 3 - one cut, vertically
   Cut code 4 - two cuts, 1st vertical, 2nd horizontal
   Cut code 5 - two cuts, 1st horizontal, 2nd vertical
.np
	Now let's try the program out, use the following inputs for
  PIECES   LENGTH   WIDTH   GRAIN  after starting with "Kerf 1"
    2 @      29       12      1
    2 @      22       11      2     [don't trust me for blueprint!
    1 @      20       12      1       this was hasty measurement
    1 @      47       12      1        just to test program!]
    1 @      47        8      1

	One more example for you to test with, but don't trust your good
china to my measurements!!
  PIECES   LENGTH   WIDTH   GRAIN  after starting with "Kerf 2"
    1      47.25    15.5      1
    2      48       20        1
    2      54       13        1
    4      41.5     11.6      2

	A final important comment. The program has many possibilities for
further development and improvement in solving such questions as "how can
I best get X items of sizes A, B, C, ..... into (or out of) Y area?" Those
that wish to investigate further will find the REM lines of help.
