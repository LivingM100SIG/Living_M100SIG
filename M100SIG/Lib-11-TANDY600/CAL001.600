            *FORCING YOUR MODEL 600 TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEXT YEAR*
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

           <aka "Discovering your computer is NOT just a machine">

     Using the Model 600 Portable Computer to keep your schedule straight is
a blessing when you have alot of things to do, places to go, and people to
see.  Since my purchase of "Igor",(My Model 600), I've enjoyed the built-in
"CALENDAR" application and, its related data file "CALENDAR.CAL" greatly.
I've entered my appointments, tasks, etc. as per the owners manual(one of
the FEW ROM programs that is documented well), and Igor prompted, prodded,
and reminded me through-out the year.

     Then on a fateful November evening of 1986, I was making some plans for
the first week of January 1987.  I entered into the "CALENDAR" month
display, advanced to January 1987, entered my data for January 5.
Everything was going fine... with my thoughts lingering on the upcoming
event in the New Year, I pressed "J" and <Enter> to "Jump" back from the
Daily Diary Screen, to the Monthly Calendar Screen.  It was here that Igor
and I had different ideas.

     The now familiar "*" that shows that something is scheduled was not
showing on January 5th! In fact, it wasn't showing anywhere!  Now we both
know that computers do not think for themselves, so obviously if must be due
to operator error. [For those of you regular users of the M100 SIG you know
by now that I'm VERY capable of that.]  Soooo....I highlighted January 5th,
and proceeded to the Daily Diary Screen once more.  What's This?! My data is
still here.  Hmmmmmm. Well let's try again.  I deleted my entry for January
5th and re-entered it.  Repeating the above mentioned process I gingerly
coaxed Igor back to the Monthly Calendar Screen.

     It was at this point that I realized that I had aquired one of those
rare computers that had a mind of its own.  What to do....what to do?  For
if Igor continued to sulk, gobbling up data for 1987, and not showing the
when, why, and where-fore, my nice tightly run schedule could fall apart in
just a matter of weeks, maybe even days!  I could almost hear the chuckle
from the corner where I had put Igor to think about what he was doing.

     Then almost involuntarily a slight snicker uttered from MY lips.  If
Igor could play these kind of games, so could I!  I put my Model 200 where
Igor could see it, (any Model of computer will work.).  This distracted Igor
long enough so that I could get back to the System Manager Screen without
any complaints from Igor.( He does love so to show off).  I then Pressed "S"
for "SET".  Igor again took no notice and continued to stare at the other
computer, almost gloating that he could get my schedule so loused up.

Now here is where you too can get the upper hand...Press "C" for Clock, and
change the "Year" from "mm/dd/1986" to "mm/dd/1987" and Press <enter>
without changing the time.  Igor snickered at my ignorance at this point.
After all, it was 1986, and I was trying to tell him it was 1987.  "Oh
well.." I could almost see his screen display.  "Poor guy's mind is
slipping, might as well humor him."  Igor promply displayed the new year of
"1987".

     My heart raced with anticipation as I made the now almost automatic
entries to get back to the Monthly Calendar Screen for January.  I deleted
my data one more time, and re-entered....ONE MORE TIME(Know the feeling?)!
With my fingers shaking I then headed back to the Monthly Calandar Screen.
SUCCESS!! There was the "*" showing on January 5th, telling me something was
scheduled.  Now for the REAL test.  Now for the REAL test of superiority.
I went back to the System Manager and using the same process as above,
changed the year back to 1986.  There was almost a defient sneer emmitting
from Igor as I headed back towards the CALENDAR for hopefully the last time.
The "*" still showed in January 1987!  And the data entries where also still
intact!  "Well, Igor... What do you have to say to that!?"

     Igor just sat there and stared up at me like a "normal" machine would.
But we all know better, don't we.  Be careful though.  If Igor has taught
this to your machine also, while they were all sitting around the warehouse
with nothing to do, you will have to fool yours into thinking it is 1987 for
1987 CALENDAR entries until the New Year for 1987 actually rolls around.  I
wish Tandy would keep these guys seperated in the warehouse.  These machines
are as bad as a mess of school kids playing pranks when left alone too long.
Good Luck!
