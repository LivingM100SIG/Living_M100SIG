                 HOW TO BYPASS THE 80 CHARACTER LIMIT ON LPT1:
                          IN TANDY 600 HANDHELD BASIC

      The LPT1: device in Handheld Basic will automatically add a carriage
 return and a line feed after every eighty characters whether we want it to or
 not.  The GW-Basic WIDTH command was not implemented in HH-Basic.  This
 prevents HH-Basic from printing the full width of "wide carriage" printers, or
 the full width in compressed mode.  It also prevents the proper printing of
 bit image graphics, due to the two "extra bytes of data" being added every
 eigthy bytes.
      Fortunately, the solution is not terribly complex.  Open a disk or memory
 file for output as 1.  Then replace LPRINT with PRINT#1, placing the "printed"
 output in that file.  When all of the "printed" material is in the file, exit
 to the System Manager.  Use the Copy command to copy the file to PRN.  It
 should print to the width that you wanted.  As a final note...any file can be
 printed by copying it to the printer.
