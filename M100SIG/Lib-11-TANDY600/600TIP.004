USING CALLING CARD NUMBERS IN TELCOM SCRIPT
     Often I call Compuserve long distance and I may not want the call to be
billed to the phone I'm using.  In my phonebook file there is an entry--
COMPSVECARD with ph#  0(the # of the node I'm accessing)++++(then my calling
card number).  The + sign is a one second delay. 4 seconds is about right for
most local telephone switches, but you may need to experiment if local switch
is older. Then write a script file and connect using COMPUSVECARD for auto
logon.

BROWSING FILES QUICKLY
     If you are beginning to get alot of files and those 8 letter file names
just don't jog your memory enough, then try this: use COPY (filename) to CON
(console).  This works like the TYPE command in DOS.  Use [CTRL]S to pause to
scrolling and SHIFT BREAK to quit. This works on text files and WORD files
(disregarding to "garbage" at the beginning), however don't bother with BASIC
or PLAN files unless you're just looking for a little excitment.

EDITING INSIDE COMMAND LINES OR MULTIPLAN CELLS
     It may seem like you have to completly reenter a command or cell
formula,but whoa, thars an easier way.  Say for example, you want to change the
SET WAKE FUNCTION to enter a new date. Tab to the date entry, the entire
current setting will be in reverse, press F10 the cursor will go to the end of
the entry, now press F9 or F7 and "backup" to whatever you want to change.
After entering the changes then use <shift del> keys to erase to the right of
the cursor.  This works in all WORKS and WORD command lines, and with the Edit
function in CALENDER, FILE and PLAN.

LOW-TECH SOLUTION FOR HARD-TO-READ SCREEN
     The 600 screen is best viewed with a broad overhead light source such as
the ceiling lighting found in many offices, however our homes aren't light that
way and we go through all kinds of contortions trying to read the screen with
our home lighting.  I've found that a piano lamp, the type that extends over
the sheet music, works best for me. COMB sells a brass one for about $24-$29.
The base sets on the top of the 600 behind the screen and extend above the
screen at just the right angle for easy viewing.
