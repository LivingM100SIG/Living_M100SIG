           Modifying the Tandy 600/ZP-150 DBCALLS.LIB File

     To  use the procedure given below for modifying  DBCALLS.LIB 
you must have MSDOS or PCDOS 2.0 or greater.  The modification is 
done using the DEBUG.COM program provided with MSDOS and uses the 
I/O redirection facility of MSDOS to input the commands to  DEBUG 
from the file MAKLIB.TXT


1)  Download  a copy of the MAKLIB.TXT file  from the DL 4 database
    to your MSDOS compatible computer.
2)  Upload the file DBCALLS.LIB from Tandy 600/ZP-150 to your computer 
     and rename it as UTILITY.LIB.
3)  Copy  the  MSDOS  DEBUG.COM program to  the  same  disk  or 
    directory that contains the above two files.
4)  Enter the command line "DEBUG <MAKLIB.TXT".
   
     Make  sure you have included the character "<" in the above 
command  line as this causes DEBUG to read it's commands from the 
specified file.
     You  will see DEBUG go about modifying the file and it  will 
be written back to disk when complete.

5)  Download the modified UTILITY.LIB file to your Tandy 600/ZP-150.
