                Instructions for the Dice Machine

     The Dice Machine is designed to allow you  to  type  a  dice
rolling instruction directly from a set of game rules and  get  a
result.  As an example, our game requires you to your character's
stats using 4D6-4 to get results between 1 and  20.    Just  type
"4D6+4" at the prompt (ROLL:) and the four dice, a sum,  and  the
number of maxs and ones are displayed.  You can feed the  machine
any valid integer for the number of dice and the number  of  pips
on the die.  Only one math operation (+-*/) can be performed with
each roll.  The function keys are programmed for ten  common  die
rolls.  If you have any questions concerning this program, post a
