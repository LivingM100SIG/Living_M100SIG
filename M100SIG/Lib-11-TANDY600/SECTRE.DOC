                                   SECTREAD

     SECTREAD is a BASIC utility program to read 512-byte sectors directly
from a 3-1/2" disk in drive A: using HH/OS system interrupt &H57 (87
decimal), as described in the Tandy 600 Programmers Reference Guide.

     SECTREAD calls routines in the UTILTY.LIB library file, and that
library file must be present in RAM.

     SECTREAD creates a temporary file, "sector.tmp", in order to use the
512 byte file I/O buffer for storage of the sector data.  The UTILTY.LIB
DSVARPTR routine obtains the RAM location of this 512 byte buffer, and the
DBSYSINT routine uses the buffer address as the transfer address for disk
sector data.  The file is closed and killed when the program is
terminated.

     To use SECTREAD, place a disk in drive A:, and RUN the program from
BASIC.  SECTREAD will display the program name and version, followed by
the message, "Initializing (30 seconds)".  Roughly 30 seconds later, the
program will prompt for the "Absolute Sector Number" which you wish to
have displayed.

     The disk sector number must be entered in decimal, and should be
limited to the range: 0<=sector<=719.  The program DOES NOT validate the
sector number, although entering a number LESS THAN ZERO will end the
program.  Requesting a sector greater than the maximum absolute sector
number on the disk will cause an error.

     The 512-byte sector information is displayed in hex and in ASCII.
The leftmost side of the display contains the absolute sector number, the
track number and the relative sector number (i.e. the sector within the
track, range 0-8) in hex.  The first column to the right contains the
offset within the sector, followed by sixteen columns of two-digit hex
numbers which represent the contents of individual bytes within the
sector.  The hex columns are followed by an ASCII representation of the
same data.  Two examples follow:

     Tandy 600 3-1/2" disks are organized into 80 tracks, numbered 0
through 79.  Each track contains nine sectors, numbered 0 through 8.  Each
sector contains 512 bytes.  There are 720 absolute sectors on the disk,
numbered 0 through 719.

     Track 0 Sector 0 (absolute sector 0) is the boot sector, and may
contain a bootstrap loader for the 600.  This is what loads if you perform
an "uncooperative system boot" (ESC/ALT/LABEL at power-on or reset).

     Track 0 Sectors 1 through 4 (absolute sectors 1 through 4) contain
the File Allocation Tables (FAT's).

     Track 0 Sectors 5 through 11 (absolute sectors 5 through 11) contain
the disk's directory entries.  The directory entries may be used to
determine the absolute sector locations of the various files on the disk.
Each 32-byte directory entry contains the following information:

     Offset    Length         Content
     --------------------------------------------------
      &H00       08.     Filename
      &H08       03.     File extension
      &H0B       11.     ???
      &H16       04.     Date and Time of File Creation
      &H1A       02.   * Starting location of file
      &H1C       02.     Length of file in bytes
      &H1E       02.     ???

*  The starting location of a file is a cluster number (or whatever the
MSDOS term is).  The absolute sector may be calculated by the following
formula:

     (Cluster Number x Cluster Size) + Offset = Absolute sector

                              or

     (Cluster Number x 2) + 8 = Absolute sector number
