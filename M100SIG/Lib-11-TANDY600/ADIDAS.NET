                  Adidas Net for the Tandy 600

     Having finally replaced my ancient Z-80 CP/M system with an
MSDOS machine, I was thrilled to be able to replace the serial
line between my Tandy 600 and my desktop system with a fully
implemented Adidas Net.

     It took a bit of experimenting to be able to read and write
Tandy 600 3-1/2" disks on my XT clone's 3-1/2" 1.4Mb (720Kb
controller) drive.  I fooled around with DRIVPARM on the XT and
with ZAP600 on the Tandy 600 to no avail -- I couldn't get a
combination of device parameters which would read all of a file
on the XT, and when I wrote stuff from the XT and tried to read
it in the Tandy I got zilch.

     The solution, it turns out, is to FORMAT the 3-1/2" disk on
the XT's drive after having set the following device parameters
using DRIVPARM:

     Device parameters for B:
     --------------------------------
            DRIVE DESCRIPTION:
            Special Functions:   $00
             Device Type (/F):   $02   3.5" 720k floppy drive
            Device Attributes: $0000
     Number Of Cylinders (/T):    80
                   Media Type:   $00

            MEDIA DESCRIPTION:
             Bytes Per Sector:   512
     Sectors Per Cluster (/L):     2
             Reserved Sectors:     1
          Number Of FATs (/A):     2
        Root Dir Entries (/R):   112
                Total Sectors:   720
        Media Descriptor (/M):   $F8   hard disk
              Sectors Per FAT:     2
       Sectors Per Track (/S):     9
                   Heads (/H):     1
             Hidden Sectors_L: $0000
             Hidden Sectors_H: $0000

          Total Disk Capacity:  360k

     The command line for setting the above parameters with
DRIVPARM is:

     drivparm b: /f:2/t:80/l:2/a:2/r:112/m:$f8/h:1

     After setting the device parameters via Daniel Fandrich's
excellent program, or via the clumsier CONFIG.SYS line, I format
a single sided 80 track disk in the XT.  This disk may be written
to from the XT or from the Tandy 600.

     To implement Adidas Net on your system, format your Tandy
600 disks on a 3-1/2" drive using the above specs; slip on your
Adidas running shoes; and jog back and forth between the two
machines.  It beats hell out of 9600bps serial transfers!
