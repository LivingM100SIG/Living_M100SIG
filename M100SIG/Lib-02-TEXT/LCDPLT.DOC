.
.LCDPLT.101 creates LCDPLT.CO.  This machine code program can be called to 
produce a screen dump onto most dot matrix printers.  The example below shows 
the setup for an OKIdata 92/93/192/193 printer.  This routine was originally 
developed for the dumping histograms to a dot matrix printer.  See HISTO.DOC.

.
To dump the screen to the printer during a BASIC program use:
.
.CALLPL!,PL%,VARPTR(PL$(0))
.
.
.The setup for other printers would be established as follows:
.- PL$(0) contains the character sequence which places the printer in a 
graphics mode ready to accept 8 bit vertical graphics elements.  If PL% is 1 
then each screen pixel is a two by two square on the printer.  If PL% is 0 then
each screen pixel is a single printer dot.
.- PL$(1) contains the character sequence which sends the printer to the next 
line.  The printer should move to the left margin and down eight printer dots.
.- PL$(2) contains the character sequence which takes the printer out of 
graphics mode and back into normal text mode.
.- PL$(3) this is the first exception character's replacement string.  One or 
more graphics characters (8 bit vertical elements) will have to be treated 
specially.  The first character in this string is the exception character.  The
remainder is the string is sent to printer instead of the exception character. 
In the case of the OKIdata the char 3 decimal must be sent as two 3's to the 
printer.  The pair of 3's tell the printer to print a single 3 and not exit 
graphics mode.  (OKIdata's PL$(3) is CHR$(3)+CHR$(3)+CHR$(3).)
.- PL$(4..) addition exceptions if needed.
.- PL$(last) must contain a null string.  This string terminates the exception 
list.

.Anyone wishing to share setup values for printers they use is welcome to 
submit the information to me.  I will maintain a setup cross-reference here if 
enough interest is generated.
