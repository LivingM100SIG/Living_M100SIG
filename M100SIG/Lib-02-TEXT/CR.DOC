CR.DOC--Documentation for CR.100 V1.0

CR.100 is actually two text utilities in one.  Both are Machine Language, so 
they're small and super-fast.  Both work on the text file IN PLACE in the RAM: 
directory, without creating another copy of the file, thereby saving precious 
memory.  You should find CR.100 very helpful in managing .DO files as you move 
them back and forth from CIS to your M100.

The first CR utility, WRAP, inserts CR's into the text file for uniform line 
length, wrapping words around using the width you specify <may be 10-132 - the 
default is the last width used by SHIFT-PRINT, UPload, or CR itself.  CIS 
requires lines less than 80 characters long>.  One caution:  be careful with 
very narrow widths.  They can break up dot commands or long words.  Use WRAP 
on any text file you plan to UPLoad to CIS with XMODEM, because you can't use 
Telcom's "Width:" feature on protocoled uploads.  <I used WRAP on this DOC, 
for instance.>

The second utility, STRIP, removes extra Carriage Returns from your text file. 
 STRIP ignores lines starting with a "." to preserve any word processor dot 
command syntax.  If a CR is followed by a space character <indent> or another 
CR, a paragraph is assumed and the CR is left intact.  Otherwise, the CR is 
deleted.  If it was preceded by anything other than a space or a hyphen, the 
CR is replaced by a space <so that words don't getruntogether>.

Both routines check for CR's without accompanying LF's and then add them where 
necessary.

The whole program weighs in at under 500 bytes.  Pretty small, but not quite 
small enough for the ALT LCD buffer, so I've uploaded it as a relocating .BA 
loader.

Hope CR.100 proves useful to you.  You can test it out on this DOC, for 
starters.  Programmers will also want to see CR.SRC, the ML source code for 
CR, in Custom Software format.

Send all problems, suggestions, praise, money <especially money - Xmas is 
coming!>, etc. to:
