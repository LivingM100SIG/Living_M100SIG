	To use OKITAL.100, first take out the line feed in line 8 of the 
downloaded version to make it run correctly. Delete any text at the beginning 
and end of the program. Load the program into BASIC, turn your printer on and 
run the program. It will scroll through a page or so of paper, without printing
anything, and then stop. Wind the paper back and go to your text document. 
Whenever you want to shift into the italic font, insert an escape-2 (the escape
is made by holding down the grph key and hitting a K; you'll get a left-
pointing arrow. Put a 2 immediately after it). When you want to return to your 
normal font, insert an escape 0 for normal draft quality, or an escape 1 for 
correspondence mode. 
	This font will not work in correspondence mode, but it will work in 
bold, condensed or expanded modes.
	Remember, it's stored in volatile memory in the printer. If you turn 
the printer off, you'll have to reload OKITAL.100.
	The program uses a loop to load data into the printer memory, using 
data statements to supply the numbers (see the Oki manual for details on how to
design custom characters). If for some reason you want to change a character, 
the line numbers of the data statements correspond to the ASCII code of the 
letter. For example, if you don't like my italic j, which is Decimal 106 in 
ASCII, type "edit 106" to change it. A warning: my printer doesn't like a 
numeral nine (9) in the data statements. I don't know if this is a bug in all 
Oki 92's but you might watch out for it.

Happy printing! Paul De Groot, 72747,2571
