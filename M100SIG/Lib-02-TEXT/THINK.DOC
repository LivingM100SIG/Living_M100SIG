       THINK.IT for the Model 100
       ==========================

      THINK.IT is an outline processor for the Model 100 computer. It is simila
r to programs such as ThinkTank for the IBM or IDEA! for the Model 100. THINK.I
T is copyright (C) 1985 by Larry Groebe. Permission is granted to make and pass
along  additional copies of the program as long as line 0 is kept intact. THINK
.IT is distributed as "shareware"- if you like it and would like to receive the
full documentation (currently a growing 16+ page manual) and future updates (an
d I guarantee there will be updates since the version here still has a few bugs
) please send a donation ($20 or more would be wonderful) to:

  :::BRIEF OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:::

     I say brief, because this is a complex program. This instruction file is 7
K, yet has to hurry over the features. Hopefully, you will find THINK.IT's acti
on to be nearly intuitive, and after a little experimentation, quite easy to un
derstand. 

     THINK.IT uses not quite 6K, and requires at least 2K free to run. Here's a
typical outline THINK.IT can create. It keeps track of all the various levels a
nd lets you manipulate them easily. You have a large amount of control over the
final form of it, too: line-spacing, numbering, print width, etc...

+AMAZING SAMPLE OUTLINE
   +Why THINK.IT is a nice program.
      -Fairly small size.
      -Runs faster than competition.
      -Cheaper too!
   +Why Larry Groebe is a nice guy.
      -He worked months on the program.
   +Limitations of THINK.IT
      +250 chars each idea.
         -No paragraphs either.
      -200 ideas maximum.


     Upon running THINK.IT you will asked for a filename. If you are beginning 
a new outline, press ENTER. When you exit the program you will be asked for a f
ilename under which to save the outline. Then in future sessions use this name 
at the opening screen.

     Initially the outline consists of only a single item. Additional items in 
the outline can be added at the same level as the topic the cursor is resting o
n by pressing ENTER, or as sub-headings of the topic under the cursor by pressi
ng TAB. Each opens space for the new outline item, and the latter automatically
indents inward from the previous item.

     Outline entries can be up to 250 characters long. As you reach the right e
dge of the screen, the entry will scroll to make room for further text. Editing
is similar to TEXT- Using the cursor keys, plus the shift and control keys will
allow you to move quickly from one end of the entry to the other. When the item
is complete, pressing ENTER exits the editing mode.

     You move about the outline with the vertical cursor keys. The current item
will be highlighted in reverse video, indented to indicate where in the outline
it rests. Again, it works much like TEXT, with shift- and control- arrow keys m
oving you in larger increments. When you reach the bottom or top of the screen 
the display will scroll to reveal more entries.

     The neat part is this: you can "hide" less important entries, displaying o
nly the amount of detail you wish by pressing the left cursor key. Each time yo
u do so, the lowest visible level of entries in the outline will be hidden. Pre
ssing the right-arrow will reveal again that hidden level. Shift-left and Shift
-right will collapse the outline to its most major points and expand it to cove
r all entries, respectively. You thus have lots of control over your material.

      The various function keys perform the functions they indicate: FIND, VIEW
, PRINT, CUT, COPY, MENU. Find allows you to type in a word or phrase to search
for, and will locate that within the outline.

     View changes your "view" of the outline. View1 displays ALL items on scree
n from the top level to the lowest one selected by the left-and-right arrows. V
iew2 displays only items on the same level, and hides those both below AND abov
e. To see the subtopics of an outline entry in View 2, place the cursor on the 
desired entry and press the right arrow. That entry will vanish and it's subent
ries (and no other parts of the outline) will appear. To return to the parent e
ntry, press the left arrow.

     PRINT allows you to output your outline to a printer or to a ram file for 
further editing via TEXT. You must answer questions about the output device, th
e line spacing, the amount of indentatoin, whether outline numbers should be in
cluded, and the width of output. (a width of 0 is recommended when "printing" t
o RAM.)

     CUT and COPY excise or copy entire collections of thoughts. When you press
one of these, the thought at the cursor, - and ALL sub-thoughts 'underneath' it
- will be placed in a buffer. Then, after using ENTER or TAB to start a new ent
ry, press PASTE, and  ALL thoughts AND subthoughts will be placed at that locat
ion in the outline. If you only wish to cut a single entry, but not it's sub-en
tries, use the SHIFT-DEL key. (NOTE- once an entry has been PASTED, it is remov
ed from the buffer and cannot be pasted again).

     Pressing F8 exits THINK.IT. The file will be saved at this time. Pressing 
SHIFT-F8 will exit w/o saving the outline.

     Pressing the + key will move all items and sub-items under the cursor UP a
level in importance. You will see the indentation level change. Conversely, pre
ssing - will drop items down a level in the outline.

        ===== KEY SUMMARY =====

CURSOR KEYS
Up, Down --Moves between outline items
Shifted  --Moves screenful of items
CTRLed   --Moves to first or last item.

Left, Right --Collapses or expands
              outline one level.
Shifted     --Collapses or expands
              outline to max or min.
CTRLed      --Scrolls long entry under
              cursor to reveal more.

ADDING OUTLINE ITEMS

Tab    --Begins editing new thought
         after current one, next level.
Space  --Allows editing of existing
         thought.

IN EDITING MODE
Esc    --Erases text from an entry.
PASTE  --Pastes any cut or copied
         entries beginning at current
         loaction.
CODE-c --Converts numeric expression to
         a number.
         (EG: SIN(1)/3 gets replaced
         by the number .2804...)

left and right arrows, shifts and CTRLS, DEL, BKSP work as in TEXT during edit.
Vertical arrow or ENTER quits EDIT.

          following items up a level.
- key  -- Lowers cursor item and all
