----------------------------

The Model 100/102/200 are able to represent German characters on-screen by
using the key combinations CODE-A, CODE-O, CODE-U, CODE-S, CODE-a, CODE-o, and
CODE-u.  The Epson printers are able to print these characters, if in the
German sub-mode of the international character mode (can be switched in be
typing 'LPRINTCHR$(27)"R"CHR$(2)' in Basic).  Unfortunately, the Tandy
computers and Epson printers use different representations of these symbols,
and the following conversions are required:

  German Symbol    M100 LCD ASCII   ASCII to LPT:     Reqd Conversion
  -------------    --------------   -------------     ---------------
  Umlaut A         177 (CODE-A)      91 (was [)          177 to 91
  Umlaut O         178 (CODE-O)      92 (was \)          178 to 92
  Umlaut U         179 (CODE-U)      93 (was ])          179 to 93
  Umlaut a         182 (CODE-a)     123 (was {)          182 to 123
  Umlaut o         183 (CODE-o)     124 (was |)          183 to 124
  Umlaut u         184 (CODE-u)     125 (was })          184 to 125
     ss            185 (CODE-S)     126 (was ~)          185 to 126

GRMCVT.100 is a Basic loader which creates a relocating machine language
program which converts 100/102 German RAM files so that they will print
properly on a suitably configured Epson printer.  It will NOT run on a Tandy
200, but the source code (GRMCVT.SRC) can be modified for the '200.  Another
(slower) approach for the '200 is to use the Basic program GRMXLT.BA (DL2).

When you run GRMCVT.100 (.BA), it will show a "Loading...." message, and then
will ask for a file name.  If you specify a file which does not exist, it will
beep at you -- and return to the prompt.  Otherwise, it will convert your file
-- then return to the prompt.  ENTER in reply to the prompt will clear the m/l
code from memory and reset HIMEM to its original value.

Note that this program does not create a new file, but processes your original
file in place.  For this reason, it is very desirable to create a backup copy
of the original file -- either on disk, or in RAM with another name.
