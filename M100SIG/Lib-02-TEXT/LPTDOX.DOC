The program is a one-liner (149 bytes) that lists RAM files, asks which ones
you want to print, and prints them, with each new file starting at the top of a
page.

INSTRUCTIONS:

   At the "Name?" prompt, you type the name of the first file you want to
print, followed by <ENTER>.  You'll be prompted for a new name.

   Continue responding with file names (you can use lower-case or caps, and you
don't need a ".DO" extension) until you've listed all the files you want to
print.

   At the next "Name?" prompt, hit <ENTER>, and the printing will begin.

COMMENTS:

   This program does not format: i.e., it has no provision for word-wrap at the
end of lines, and it will balk at lines that are greater than 255 characters.

   Thus, it is not well-suited to .DO files generated by TEXT, unless you take
pains to insert carriage-returns as you write.

   I use the program mostly for files downloaded from CIS and from a host
computer at work.

   LPTDOX will pass <CTRL><P> codes to the printer; so you can underline,
italicize, et al., if you know how to use this function.  (See bottom of p. 60
in M100 manual.)

   Finally, the program assumes your printer uses CHR$(12) as a top-of-form
command.  Most printers do; but if the program "hangs," or the files don't each
print at the top of a page, consult your printer manual and change LPTDOX as
necessary.

   Because of this program's small size, it's suitable for inclusion in utility
"packages," such as Phil Wheeler's UT-LF2 in DL7.
