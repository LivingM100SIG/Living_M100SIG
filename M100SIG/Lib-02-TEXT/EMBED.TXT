EMBEDDED PRINT CODES: EPSON & GEMINI
------------------------------------

The following approach to embedding
printer codes in text to be printed on
Gemini and Epson printers is derived
from message #27752 by Bill Templeton.
Note that 'SAVE TO:LPT' type printing
must be used; 'SHIFT-PRINT' will not
respond to the codes.

Nomenclature (Model 100 keys):
  CTL = Control
  ESC = Escape
  GRA = Graph
  () are delimiters (do not type)
  CTL-P = press both keys at same time
  GRA-P = press both keys at same time

Embed the following at the point in the
text where the change in print mode is
desired:

Start underline:(CTL-P)(ESC)(-)(1)
Stop underline: (CTL-P)(ESC)(-)(GRA-P)

Start emphasize:(CTL-P)(ESC)(E)
Stop emphasize: (CTL-P)(ESC)(F)

Start italics:(CTL-P)(ESC)(4)
Stop italics: (CTL-P)(ESC)(5)

Start wide print:(CTL-P)(ESC)(W)(1)
Stop wide print: (CTL-P)(ESC)(W)(GRA-P)

Start compressed:(CTL-P)(CTL-O)
Stop compressed: (CTL-P)(CTL-R)

Start superscrpt:(CTL-P)(ESC)(S)(GRA-P)
Start subscript: (CTL-P)(ESC)(S)(1)
Stop super/sub:  (CTL-P)(ESC)(T)


I've been using these successfully with
WRITE+ and Epsons for 9 months, thanks
to Bill Templeton (or whoever came up
with the ploy of using GRA-P to fill in
for chr$(0) -- which can't be repre-
sented by the Model 100).
