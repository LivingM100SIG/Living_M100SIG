SCRDMP is a graphic screen dump utility for the LP VII, DMP100 or other printer
utilizing the 7 bit graphics character system.  The program is merged at the 
end of any program to provide graphics capability, typically you would set it 
up to be called by a function key (ex. ON KEY GOSUB 63000).  Please observe the
following notes:

1) Don't duplicate line numbers used in this subroutine.

2) This sub uses RESTORE statement, if you are using DATA statements elsewhere 
in your program, be sure you are set up to RESTORE your data pointer after 
execution of the routine.

3) The Graphics mode and Print mode control characters work with my LP VII 
printer, verify that they are the correct ones for yours.

4) Actually, the program prints the first 63 lines of pixels, if the last row 
is that important to you, another pass could be added.

Advise me of any comments or suggestions.  (J. Holovacs,95 King George Rd.,
