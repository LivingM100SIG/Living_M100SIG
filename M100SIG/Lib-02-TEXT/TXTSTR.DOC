The full TextStar program is described in the March 1989 issue
of Portable 100 magazine.  TextStar endows the TEXT program with
Wordstar-like cursor control.

The following Wordstar cursor movement commands  have  been
implemented in TextStar:

     ^D      Right one character
     ^F      Right one word
     ^QD     Right to end of current line

     ^S      Left one character
     ^A      Left one word
     ^QS     Left to beginning of current line

     ^E      Up one line
     ^QE     Top of screen, column 1
     ^QR     Top of file

     ^X      Down one line
     ^QX     Bottom of screen, right end of line
     ^QC     End of file


The following text deletion commands have been implemented:

     ^G      Delete character under the cursor
     ^T      Delete word
     ^Y      Delete line
     ^QY     Delete to end of line


The following miscellaneous commands have been implemented:

     ^KB    Mark start of block (same as F7)
     ^KY    Delete block (same as F6)*
     ^KD    Exit TextStar to Menu (same as F8)


*  Note:  The ^KY command operates differently in  TextStar.   In
Wordstar you would normally have to type ^KK to mark the end of a
block  before  deleting  it.   ^KY,  as  defined  here,  is  more
consistent with the Text function key meanings.

You will need the file TXTSTR.REL.  It is a Basic relocating loader
which creates TXTSTR.CO anywhere in high memory.  TXTSTR.ASM is the
assembly-language source code.

Download TXTSTR.REL into your machine as TXTSTR.DO.  Enter Basic
and type "LOAD TXTSTR" (without the quotes of course), type
"RUN" when you get the Ok prompt.  TXTSTR will be loaded just under
HIMEM by default or anywhere else you specify.  This is handy if you
use a disk DOS such as FLOPPY and want to load TextStar just below it.
You can delete the TXTSTR.DO file file when finished.

To use TextStar, place the widebar cursor over TXTSTR on the main
menu and press the enter key.  You will see the familiar TEXT
"file to edit?" prompt.  Everything from here on will look and
feel just like TEXT except for the cursor movement commands.
