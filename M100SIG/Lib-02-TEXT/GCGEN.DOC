.   GCGEN.100 is a program that allows the user to design and download custom
characters to the gemini 10X printer. These characters can be designed and
downloaded individually or a .DO file can be created to allow the storage and
downloading of multiple characters at any time.
.   Other facilities allow activating, and de-activating of the downloaded
custom characters, copying of the normal printer character set to the
downloadable character set in the printer, downloading single characters,
and printing of a character while in the process of designing it.
.   The program is operated from two menus and a character generation screen.
.
.
.New Character/Download Menu:
.
.Option 1 - Build character - Transfers user to character generation screen, to
allow building of a character.
.
.Option 2 - Activate downloaded characters - Sends proper codes to the
printer to "turn-on" the downloaded characters. The printer horn will sound,
when completed.
.
.Option 3 - De-activate downloaded characters - Sends proper codes to the
printer to "turn-off" the downloaded characters. The printer horn will sound,
when completed.
.
.Option 4 - Copy normal characters to printer - Sends proper codes to cause the
printer to copy its standard character set into the downloaded character area
inside the printer. The printer horn will sound, when completed.
.Note: When Option 4 is executed, all downloaded characters are copied over
with the standard character set.
.
.Option 5 - Downloads all characters defined in the download file CHAR.DO to
printer.
.Note: This option does not activate the downloaded characters.
.
.Option 0 - Exit GCGEN.BA - Returns user to M100 main menu
.
.
.Character Generation Screen:
.
.   This display allows the user to build a new character. A 9 by 8 area is
set up on the right side of the screen, which represents the character the
printer will print. The user may move the cursor around in this area setting
or re-setting dots to generate the new character. Another smaller 9 by 8 area
is displayed just to the right of the main display to allow the user to more
easily visualise what the character will look like.
.
.The following keys may be used to generate the character;
.
.Cursor Control Keys     - Moves the cursor around with-in the 9 by 8 grid.
.
.S or s - Sets a dot. The gemini printer does not allow two consecutive dots in
the same row, GCGEN.100 does'nt either. the M100 will beep if this is attempted.
.
.R or r - Resets a dot
.
.P or p - takes the character on the screen, downloads it to the printer,
activates the downloaded character set, and prints the character.
.Note: The default character used is an ASCII 94 (^). The printer remains with
the downloaded characters activated, and ASCII 94 = the new character.
.
.ENTER - Enters character, transfers user to the Character Save/Download menu.
.
.ESC - deletes character, returns user to the New Character/Download Menu.
.
.
.Character Save/Download Menu:
.

Generation Screen. Prompts user for ASCII value for character, and whether the
character is a decender (shifted two rows down from print line when printed
i.e. "g").
.Note: This option does not activate the downloaded character.
.
.Option 2 - Print Character - Prints character designed with Character

Character Generation Screen to download file CHAR.DO. Prompts user for ASCII
value for character, and whether the character is a decender (shifted two
rows down from print line when printed i.e. "g").
.
