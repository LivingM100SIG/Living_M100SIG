     T-WORD TIP #1

     ===================

     This  tip  explains  an  easy  method  to obtain formatted (even right
     justified) footnotes using  the  footer  option  of  the  T-WORD  word
     processor  included  in  the SARDINE ROM. This will probably also work
     with the T-WORD in UR-2.

     ---------------

     The T-WORD manual states that to use the footer option of the  program
     to  produce  footnotes you should use ENTER after each individual line
     of the footnote. This works fine and can be very helpful  but  it  can
     also  be  cumbersome to count characters on a 40 col display with word
     wrap. This method also makes editing the footnotes a chore  since  you
     must reformat each individual line. There is an easier way.

     If  T-WORD  encounters  a  footer when formatting a page it counts the
     CR's in the footer declaration and places the footer that  many  lines
     above  the  bottom  margin.  Other than this the footer formats to the
     defaults on the menu screen.

     If you have a footnote that requires more than one line to  print  you
     need  only  enter  an extra CR at the end of the footer declaration to
     take care of each extra line required. T-WORD will  then  format  your
     footnote for you automatically. This allows you to edit your footnotes
     free-form without worrying about defining each individual line.

     In  addition  you  can  also  use  other  formatting  features without
     problem, such as outdent to  number  your  footnotes,  or  even  right
     justification. 

     The  extra  CR's  are printed at the top of the next page. This may or
     may not be a problem for you. If it is the section at the end of  this
     doc  will be of help. If you enter too many extra CR's you will simply
     have another extra blank line or so at the top of the  next  page.  If
     you  enter  too few the extra lines of the footnote will carry over to
     the top of the next page. These problems are easy to track  using  the
     page  break and plot options. With a bit of imagination, and the right
     printer codes, you can even format the  footnotes  in  another  pitch,
     such as compressed print.

     Conflicts...

     It would be great if it was all this simple but unfortunately there is
     a  conflict  that I need to mention. The good news is that the problem


     -----

     p.s. This is a demonstration of what i mean using both the outdent and
          the right justification options on a footnote. This one  required
          2 extra CR's to format on this page.










                                     Page 2

     is correctible.

     T-WORD  will go crazy if you attempt to use headers when you are using
     this method. The reason is that the CR's carried over to the next page
     interfere with the formatting of the header. This  will  not  cause  a
     system  crash,  but  your printer won't appreciate the result, and may
     start printing in Katakana. An adjunct to this  problem  is  that  the
     carried over CR's push the top margin down that many lines on the next
     page.  This  may or may not be a problem, depending on how finicky you
     are.

     Fortunately this 'problem' is double edged. You can use the carry over
     lines from the footer as the header for the next page (really!). Since
     the page number is incremented when the bottom margin is  overrun  you
     can  even  put  the  page number in the ersatz header. This method was
     used to produce this document.*

     All you need to do is to enter your header text in place of the  extra
     CR's  at  the end of the footnote. The 'header' will then print out on
     the next page, in exactly the same place each time. I could go through
     all sorts of examples but now that you know how it works you should be
     able to figure it out for yourself. You only need to be sure to  start
     the header with the first extra line of the footer. If you need a line
     separation  between  the  header and the text just be sure you have an
     extra CR after the header text.

     You can produce extra blank carry over lines by simply entering a line
     of spaces that exceed the right margin in the footer.  Each  of  these
     lines will produce an extra carry over line.

     Using  the methods described above and a bit of imagination I have not
     yet found a combination of footers, footnotes and headers that I could
     not produce using T-WORD. TRAVELING could have made it  a  bit  easier
     with  the  addition  of a couple of very simple functions but that's a
     subject for another time. Until then  i  think  you  will  find  these
     methods   will   suffice   for  just  about  any  type  of  footnoting
     requirements.

     Another time...

     If you really need footnotes a lot it may be wise to drop TRAVELING  a
     line  regarding  some  changes in the program to make the feature more
     built in. I am relatively certain that this could be  done  without  a
     heck  of  a  lot  of  changes to the program. The fact that the simple
     method outlined above works is ample proof of that fact. It  certainly
     would enhance an already terrific program.

     And  since you finished the spelling checker TRAVELING, how's about an
     index generator guys.

     Get on 'em folks. No rest for the weary!

     * One trick that I have not tested yet is the use of the  block  merge
       command  in a footer to 'boilerplate' the footnotes. I don't see why
       it shouldn't work.
