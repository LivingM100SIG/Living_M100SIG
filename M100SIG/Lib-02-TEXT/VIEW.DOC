 VIEW.CO is a machine language program that alows you to
veiw a full 60 columns of text with 10 lines on your Model
100. This means 600 characters can be displayed at one
time, almost as much as the Tandy 200. Compare this with
the normal 40 charaters by 8 lines which can only display
320 characters.
 View is 1.4K and Himem should be set at 61600. The display
is readable and easy to use. It has full uppercase and
lowercase characters with descenders. Characters below
CHR$(32) [Space] are not shown and characters above
CHR$(125) [}] are shown as CHR$(255). The TAB key is
reconized as eight spaces. View has word wrap on Space and
Dash.
 View was written to supplement pixel-mapping, helping to
find formatting errors. It was not my intent to write a
text editor. My feeling is that a 4K utility would not be
used as much as a 1.5K (with View.ba) utility whould. The
Model 100 has a good text editor and anything less would
have been almost useless.
 View uses a basic driver to set Himem, load the Filename
and set word wrap. The idea is that you will probably use
view, then go into Text then back to View ect. The basic
driver alows you to only enter the information once until
you want to change something.
 ex. You run View.ba for a file. It loads View.co and sets
the file and word wrap and then showes your file. You see
something you need to change so you go to the text file and
make an edit. When you return to the Menu just place the
cursor on View.co and presto you'll see the text file
without answering any promts. If you decide to change say
word wrap Run View.ba at the File name promt press enter,
then enter the new word wrap setting. Well thats the idea.
The basic driver is:
 
10 CLEAR56,61600
20 CALL7994:INPUT"File Name";A$:IFLEN(A$)>6THEN20
30 IFA$=""THEN60
40 A$=A$+SPACE$(6-LEN(A$))+"DO":FORX=1TO8
45 F=ASC(MID$(A$,X,1)):IFF>96THENF=F-32
50 POKE62950+X,F:NEXT
60 INPUT"Word Wrap";I
70 IFI<10ORI>60THENI=60
80 POKE62959,I*4-1
90 RUNM"View
 
 Note: Just copy this with the text editor and paste into
basic and Save as View.ba. If you enter a bad filenameor no
file name View.co will just return you to the Menu.

 When you run View.ba you'll see the files in memory and
then be asked for a Filename. Enter a valid file name
(without extension) and press enter. Next you'll be asked
for a Word Wrap setting. Just press enter for the full 60
columns or enter your favorite setting. If you enter a
number less than 10 or greater than 60 View.ba will enter
60 for you.
 The screen will clear and display the first screen of
text.
 
  [F8] Takes you to the Menu
  [F4] Takes you into the text file you working with.
  [Up Arrow] Takes you to the start of file.
  Any other key will take you to the "next page". Note
  that the last line of the current screen is the
  first line of the next screen.
 
Convert View.Hex to View.Co with Change.Ba in DL4. Download
View.Hex as VHEX.DO (2806 bytes). BACKUP ALL FILES IN RAM!
Edit the file to remove the garbage in the begining and end
of the file. Run Change.ba, place the cursor over VHEX.DO
and press [F2], respond to the file name prompt with
'View'. Return to this documentation file and using Copy
and Paste, make a copy of the small basic program in this
documentation file. Go into basic and press PASTE. Save the
file as View.ba.
 
 I am suprised that this utility is not already in the data
base here on the Sig. The character set was based on
Telewiter-64 for the Color Computer. But I may have gotten
a little carried away with the 10 lines but 8 line
characters seemed too skinny. If some one would like, they
can add a text editor, just let me know if you do.
 
Problems
 
 If you have any problems send me Email as I travel a lot
and may not be on the Sig for months at any given time.
 
Technical
 
 The first part of View was compiled with TCOMP 61600 -
62662. The data for the character set is stored from 62663
to 62950 at three bytes each.
