PRINT is a machine language text processing program for the 
Model 100 computer.  The features in PRINT do not rival 
commercially available text processing programs, but they 
are adequate for most printing requirements.  The features 
include margins, line width, page length, single/double 
space, right justify, font selection, send/suppress line 
feeds, start at any page, horizontal centering, and hanging 
indentations.  You can also preview your print file on the 
LCD, display page breaks, and "graph" a page of text on the 
LCD screen.  THIS VERSION CAN BE CONFIGURED TO YOUR SPECIFIC
PRINTER!  See PRN100.MOD for details.

PRINT uses 59900-62959 in your Model 100 RAM.  Any machine 
language programs presently in that area should be saved to 
RAM or tape before loading PRINT.  I strongly encourage you 
to save ALL your files to tape before loading PRINT or any 
other machine language program.  A bad load could cause a 
"Cold Start" which will destroy all your files.

Now for the program itself.  It is going to be loaded as 
PRINT.CO.  If you have a file by that name, then rename it 
before loading this program.  Follow this procedure to 
obtain PRINT:

1.  Download PRN100.OBJ as PRN100.DO
2.  Download PRN100.LDR as PRNLDR.DO
3.  Using TEXT, inspect both files and
    delete any garbage from the
    beginning and end of the files.
4.  Go to BASIC
5.  Load "PRNLDR"
6.  Kill "PRNLDR.DO"
7.  Save "PRNLDR.BA"
8.  Run

After about 4 1/2 minutes, you will either get a "Load 
Successful" or "Load Failed" message.  The error message 
will indicate a bad load.  Inspect PRN100.DO for garbage, or
download the file again.  After a successful load, you may 
kill PRNLDR.BA and PRN100.DO.  Save a copy of PRINT to tape.
  In BASIC, type:

CSAVEM"PRINT",59900,62959,60503

Push F8 and go to the main menu.

NOTE:  If you reload from tape, follow this procedure:

1.  Go to BASIC
2.  CLEAR 256,59900
3.  CLOADM"PRINT"
4.  SAVEM"PRINT",60503,60503,60503
5.  Go to MENU

At this point you have successfully loaded PRINT.  Your menu
should now contain PRINT.CO.  If you have a .DO file already
created, then you may proceed.  Otherwise, create one.

Back at the main menu, place the cursor over PRINT.CO and 
press ENTER.  You should see a display of all your .DO files
(without the .DO extension).  F8 is labeled as Menu.  The 
lower left corner of the screen will say:

Select: TEST.DO

PRINT saves the last filename that you worked with.  If you 
want to work with that file again, then just press ENTER.  
Otherwise, enter the name of the program you want to use.  
The .DO extension is optional.  The program won't accept a 
bad file name.  It will give you the chance to enter another
program name.  You can enter a bad name just to see what the
error message looks like.

Once you have entered a valid file name, the screen will 
look like this:

[L]eft Margin    10 [R]ight Margin   10
[C]har Printed   60 [J]ustify Right   N
[T]op Margin      6 [B]ottom Margin   8
[P]age Length    66 [D]ouble Space    N
[F]ont Code       1 [A]dd Line Feed   N
[S]tart @ Page    1 [W]ait Btwn Pages Y
Select:
          File Grph PBrk Disp Prnt Menu

Also, in the lower left corner, your selected file will be 
displayed in reverse video.

Select an option by pressing the letter in the brackets.  
Just press the letter, the ENTER key is not needed.  The Y/N
parameters will simply change their state when you press 
their letter.

The other options will ask you for an input.  Only numbers 
are recognized, other characters are ignored.  Press ENTER 
at the completion of your input.  The range for inputs is 0-
255.  Going past 255 does no harm, though.  The program just
"wraps around."  A 256 is a 0, a 257 is a 1, etc.  PRINT 
does limit you to 3 characters of input.  If you try to 
enter 1000, it just won't let you do it.  Change a few 
parameters to get the feel of the program.  I think it's 
pretty easy to use.

Most of the options are self explanitory.  Those you might 
not understand are:

Justify Right:  Inserts spaces between words to square up 
the right margin.

Font:  Type style used by the printer.  Set this up by using
PRN100.MOD.

Add Line Feed:  Some printers require a line feed character 
to index to the next print line.  The Model 100 suppresses 
the line feeds.  If you need the line feeds, this command 
will add them for you.

Start @ Page:  Gives you the option to start printing 
somewhere other than the beginning of the file.  If you try 
to print Page 3 of a two-page file, you will get an error 
message.

Wait Between Pages:  This command is used if you want to 
stop printing between each page.  I use it for feeding cut 
sheets or for printing one or two pages of a long report.  
After the required pages have been printed, just press ESC 
to end the printing.

NOTE:  [C]har Printed is the actual number of characters you
want printed on each line.  [P]age Length is the total page 
length.  The number of lines printed is Page Length minus 
the Top and Bottom Margin.

FUNCTION KEY DESCRIPTIONS:

F3 - File - This key returns you to the file selection menu 
of the PRINT program.

F4 - Grph - This option uses pixel graphics to display a 
page of text on the LCD screen.  The screen only has 64 
lines.  A 66 line page can be displayed as long as the 
bottom margin is at least 2.  The graph function is limited 
to total page widths of 189 characters.  After that, there 
is no room left on the LCD.  Lines or page lengths longer 
than these values can be used by PRINT, it just won't graph 
properly.

F5 - PBrk - This function is used to display on the LCD the 
first and last line of each page.  In double space mode, the
last line is always a blank line.  Occasionally, a blank 
line within your text file will end a page.  Don't be 
surprised if you see that happen.  A line on the screen 
separates each page.  The program waits for a keypress 
before going to the next page.

F6 - Disp - This sends your entire text file to the LCD.  It
will be formatted as if being sent to the printer.  Pages 
are separated by a line.  Like F5, press any key to go to 
the next page.

F7 - Prnt - This is what the program is all about!  Your 
text file will be formatted to your specifications and sent 
to the printer.  PRINT does check to see if your printer is 
ready.  If not, the program will tell you.  If you enable 
your printer, then the program will begin printing.  Use ESC
if you want to abort the print option.

F8 - Menu - Returns to the Model 100 main menu.

NOTE:  During F4-F7, pressing any key (except the keys 
listed in the CAUTION below) will Pause the function.  
Pressing any key again will resume the function.  Pressing 
ESC will abort the function and return to the Select options
page.

CAUTION:  During PRINT or any other machine language program
refrain from pressing PASTE, LABEL, PRINT, or PAUSE/BREAK.  
My program uses several Model 100 ROM subroutines.  If you 
press one of those keys while PRINT is in one of those 
subroutines, then I have no way of intercepting the 
keypress.  Model 100's ROM will try to take control and you 
may have difficulty getting back to PRINT.  In a case like 
that, pressing BREAK and typing MENU will usually get you 
back to the Model 100 menu.

PRINT suppresses any blank lines at the beginning of a page.
  If you need blank lines, just type a space before the 
first carriage return.  The program does not consider the 
space to be a blank line.

Also, the program issues a Form Feed command after each 
page.  This is the same as CHR$(12).  I think this command 
is common to all printers.  If you need to disable the form 
feed, then POKE zeros in 61781, 61782, and 61783.

EMBEDDED CONTROL CODES

Certain control characters can be embedded in your text file
to enable and disable some printing options.  These are:

^C - Horizontally center a line
^P - Start a new page
^W - Cancel Hanging Indentations
^X - Hanging Indentation - Left Only
^Y - Hanging Indentation - Left & Right

None of these Control Codes depend on your printer.  It's 
done using spaces.

^C - Horizontal Centering - This centers a line by inserting
the appropriate number of spaces at the start of the line.  
If you want to center several lines, put a ^C in each one.  
The ^C can be anywhere within the line to be centered.

^P - New Page - When PRINT encounters a ^P within the text 
file, it immediately forces the start of a new page.

^X, ^Y, ^W - Hanging Indentations - This is a feature that I
haven't seen in the commercial printing programs.  It's 
actually the reason I wrote this program in the first place.
  A Hanging Indentation indents all the lines in a paragraph
EXCEPT the first one.  When I write a report, I frequently 
have numbered items within that report.  I want the 1,2,3 
etc against the left margin, but I don't want the text 
there.  For example:

1.  I want a Hanging Indentation
    to line up the text and leave
    the number against the left
    margin.

2.  PRINT allows me to do that
    automatically.

See what I mean?  I allowed two types of indentations.  One 
indents the text only on the left side.  The other indents 
the text on both the right and left side.  The left and 
right indentation is useful to set off a couple of 
paragraphs of text if you remember to put the right number 
of spaces at the start of the first line.

To use hanging indentations, insert a ^X (left only) or a ^Y
(left and right) at the location where you want the indent 
to be effective.  ^Y puts the same indent on the left and 
the right side - there is no way to specify a different left
and right indent.  The indent will be effective continuously
until a ^W turns it off.  Typically, the ^W would occur as 
the last character in the last paragraph to be indented.

To embed a control character in a text file, do this:

1.  Hold down the CTRL key.
2.  Press P (the display will not change)
3.  Continue holding the CTRL key down
4.  Press the character to be embedded
5.  Release the CTRL key

PRINT allows you to embed your own control codes within text
files.  PRN100.MOD describes how to set up PRINT to your 
specifications.

The program does not do page headers or page numbers.  When 
I need these features, I simply run my paper through the 
printer twice.  I leave a large enough top margin to add the
information later.  Then I can write a text file or a BASIC 
program to do the page headers or numbers.

That's it!  I hope you have fun with the program.  For the 
machine language buffs out there, feel free to disassemble 
this program.  It is difficult to follow because I don't use
an assembler.
