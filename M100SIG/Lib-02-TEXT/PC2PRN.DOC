                       DOCUMENTATION FOR PC2PRN.LDR


Program PC2PRN.LDR provides a means for sharing a printer between a
personal computer and the Model 100 laptop computer.  This is a machine-
language program, and I have no way of testing whether it works with the
Tandy 102 or 200.  First, I will describe the way it is used.

The hardware requirements are:  a personal computer with a serial
communications port, a cable connecting it to the serial communications
port of the Model 100, the Model 100 (of course), and a printer connected
to the parallel port of the Model 100.  Any connection between the Model
100 and the parallel printer that works for printing with the Model 100
should work for printing with the PC and this program.

Serial cable connections (assuming a serial port with a 25-pin connector on
the PC):

        Model 100      PC
        ---------      --
        GND   1........1   GND
         TX   2........3   RX
         RX   3........2   TX
        RTS   4........5   CTS
        CTS   5........4   RTS
        DSR   6.......20   DTR
        GND   7........7   GND
        DTR  20........6   DTR

Note that this was the standard cable sold by the Portable Computer Support
Group for use with Disk+ when I bought it in 1985 (the rest of the pins are
connected straight through, but are not internally connected in the Model
100, so they don't matter).

Here's a picture, for clarification:

+------+     +-------+     +-----+
|  PC  |.....| Model |.....| LPT |

+------+ ser +-------+ par +-----+

Back to operation of the program:

When this program is running, the Model 100 acts as a serial-to-parallel
converter for the data being sent out by the PC.  Any (yes, any) characters
sent out the serial port of the PC are sent to the parallel printer
attached to the Model 100.  There is no translation of tabs, nulls,
controlZ's, or any special characters, so that even graphics may be sent
through this program.  To print directly from the Model 100, simply
terminate the program (using F8) and print as you normally would from the
Model 100.  There is one small catch:  printers connected to PC's normally
do not generate a linefeed when a carriage return is sent, whereas the
Model 100 expects a printer attached to it to generate this linefeed.  I
deal with this by setting up the printer in the normal fashion for use with
a PC, and then I use a program on the Model 100 that accompanies all CR's
(carriage returns) sent to the printer with a linefeed (such as LPTLF).


                          DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:

Download the program PC2PRN.LDR to your Model 100, naming it PC2PRN.DO.
Enter BASIC, and type
  CLEAR 256,MAXRAM-1000
  LOAD "PC2PRN.DO"
  SAVE "PC2PRN"
  KILL "PC2PRN.DO"
  RUN
The program presents you for a range of end addresses that are possible,
given your current values of HIMEM and MAXRAM.  You may enter the address
that you like, or you may just press <ENTER> and it will create it at the
highest address you have available.  When the program is done, you will
have a new program, PC2PRN.CO, in your list of files, as well as PC2PRN.BA.
At this point, you may wish to store PC2PRN.BA to cassette tape or disk;
you won't need it again unless you decide you want to change the loading
address of PC2PRN.CO or PC2PRN.CO gets wiped out of your memory.

To run PC2PRN.CO, simply move the widebar cursor over it and press return.
The screen clears, except for the row of function key labels at the bottom.
They are:  F1: RTS, F2: DTR, F3: LPT, F4: LCD, F5: DSR, F6: CTS, and F8:
MENU.  Any that are currently "ON" are in inverse video.

Now, you need to set up your PC.  Type in the commands
  MODE COM1:9600,n,8,1,P
  MODE LPT1=COM1
assuming that the serial port on your PC that is connected to your Model
100 is COM1.

Make sure your printer is on.  Now, print a short file from the PC, for
test purposes.  You should see the characters going across the screen, and
they should also appear on your printer.  Notice that the characters on the
LCD of the Model 100 do not scroll, but output returns to the top line
after the bottom line is filled.  Also notice that control characters are
made visible by a caret (^) in front of the control key that would generate
them.  (You should see frequent ^M^J combinations, indicating the carriage
return/linefeed pairs.)  You should also see the labels for RTS and DTR
going on and off.  This indicates the hardware handshaking going on between
your Model 100 and PC.

For higher printing speeds, you may turn off the output to the Model 100
screen by pressing F4, indicating LCD.  Pressing the active function keys
F1 through F4 toggle their respective functions ON and OFF.  Likewise,
press F4 again to turn on screen display and press F3 to turn off
transmission to the printer.  Now, you have a way of displaying the
characters coming out of the serial port of your PC.

One other thing to note:  characters typed at the keyboard of the Model 100
are sent to the PC.  One way to have some fun with this is to turn
everything on (press F3 again to turn on LPT transmission).  Now, type
  CTTY COM1:
at the keyboard of your PC.  Note that the PC does not give another prompt
on the screen; instead, there it is on your Model 100!  Type a command at
the keyboard of your Model 100; what you type is printed in inverse video,
and the PC echoes each character.  When you press ENTER, the PC should
execute your command.  The information from the PC should also be appearing
on your printer.  Keep this in mind in case your PC monitor dies (mine has,
twice).  To terminate this insanity, type
  CTTY CON
at the keyboard of the Model 100; a new prompt should appear on the screen
of your PC.

Before turning anything off, terminate the program by pressing F8 (MENU).
Occasionally, it does seem to get "hung up" if something is turned off
while the program is running.  Pressing SHIFT-BREAK usually will get you
out, but it is better to remember to terminate the program first.
