GPRINT.BA is a program that can be used for configuring the gemini 10X printer
The program has 4 modes of operation;
   1 - Configure Printer - allows the setting of print font, line feed value
       character width, type style, print type, right & left margins*, first
       line printed*, perf skip, Uni-dir print, and print with paper out.

       * These values should be left at default if using "Format Print"

   2 - Envelope Mode - Allows addressing of buisness and letter size envelopes.
       Line 400 allows you to set a default return address. Default addresses
       can be over-ridden simply by typing in a new line. Comma's can be
       used on addresses. BKSP is supported.

   3 - Quick Print - Opens a .DO file and prints contents sequentially.

   4 - Format Print - Opens a .DO file and prints contents. Formats output -
       Right justifies (ragged left), sets right, left, top, and bottom margins.
       >> Text should be entered in the .DO file. Carriage returns should only
          be entered where desired (i.e. end of paragraph, to add blank lines,
          etc.)
       Variables for setting margins are set in line 2; L=left margin, R=right
       margin, T=blank lines on top, B=page lenght.

Imbedding Printer Control Codes:
  Format Print allows imbedded printer control codes in text. The Codes are:
   &0& Form feed
   &1& Select italic character set
   &2& Select normal Character set
   &3& Select underlined print
   &4& Cancel underlined print
   &5& Select double-wide print
   &6& Cancel double-wide print
   &7& Select super-script
   &8& Select sub-script
   &9& Cancel super/sub-script

 To use simply enter code in .DO file. The actual code characters will not be
printed. The gemini printer executes control codes on recieving a carriage
return, therefore it is not possible to select & cancel a code in the same line.
