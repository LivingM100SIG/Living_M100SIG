          Easily customized for other DMP printers 

          This  program  sends  Control  Codes  to the DMP 105. They can be 
          sent in  any  order,  e.g.,  use  <1>  for  BOLD  then,  <4>  for 
          CONDENSED, <0> for Menu and DMP will now print BOLD CONDENSED. 

          Be  sure  to  use the OFF selections to take printer out of BOLD, 
          WIDE (elongate), and BIG BOLD, or just  Turn  printer  off  &  on 
          again to put printer back to normal mode. 

          BIG  BOLD  is a print font I use in place of Elongated. Elongated 
          will print 40 chars across; BIG BOLD will print 48 & the type  is 
          easier on the eyes.
