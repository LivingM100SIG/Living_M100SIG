                            COLUMN DOCUMENTATION

         COLUMN.BAS  is a program to develop a multiple column file or
    printout - something like a telephone book - from a file which has
    narrow width text lines.  Although the program was developed using a
    TANDY MODEL 100 computer with the Disk/Video Interface and an EPSON
    MX-80/GRAFTRAX printer it should also work without modification with
    the Chipmunk and TDD.  Use with the TANDY 200 will require changing
    the PRINT@ statements in lines 380, 710, 1320, and 1330.

         The PRINTER SET-UP portion of the program (Lines 1000 to 190)
    include printer codes for the EPSON MX-80.  These codes will have to be
    changed if the printer used is not compatable with this format. The
    program lines are:

         Lines 1010-1020  Prompt printer turn-on

         Lines 1030-1040  Prompts for COMPRESSED TEXT

         Lines 1050-1060  Tests for line width and sets to 16.5 cpi if line
    width is greater than 80 characters, sets double strike if 16.5 cpi,
    and sets emphasized print if 10 cpi.

         Lines 1070-1080  Compresses Text. In this routine, the print is
    compressed, printer set to sub-script mode, line spacing set to 7/72
    inch, and double strike is enabled.

         Line 1090  Sets paper to top of page, resets line printer, and
    resets paper to next top of page.

         The program is completely self prompting. The first 35 characters
    of the first 8 lines of the input file are displayed at the appropriate
    time to assist in determing the number of header lines in the
    reformatted output file. The header lines are centered over the text in
    the output file.

         When the INPUT FILE is requested, all of the RAM files are
    automatically displayed, with providions to display the disk DO files
    if selected as shown on the screen.

         If [ENTER] is pressed at the request for OUTPUT FILE, the  input
    file will be replaced with the reformatted file by the program. Output
    file of "LPT:" will provide printout of the input file.

         At the request for Char/Line, the display or printer width should
    be entered. The program is set up for 8 1/2 inch paper width. If wider
    paper is used, the "PC>80" in line 1050 should be changed to reflect
    the actual paper width.

         The program sets the line width of the output columns to one
    character wider than the maximum width of the input file text lines;
    however, the output column width may be changed when prompted by the
    display.

         The program automatically changes the line printer 16.5 cpi if the
    output file width exceeds 80 columns.

         In use of this program it was found that it is usually more
    convenient to develop a RAM or DISK file and printout this file rather
    than printing directly to the line printer. Although the program will
    handle any length files within capability of the computer capacity, it
    is recommended that printed output files be limited to a single sheet.
    Remember that input and output files may be stored on disks to conserve
    the RAM!

         Function Keys F4 (RUN), F6 (EDIT), and F8 (MENU) are activated. 
    Changes in the operation of the Function Keys may be changed by
    changing Line 160 and Lines 1250 to 1340.

         COLUMN.EX1 (Ten Code) and COLUMN.EX2 (Phonetic Alphabet) provide
    examples of files to be used to get acquainted with the program.
