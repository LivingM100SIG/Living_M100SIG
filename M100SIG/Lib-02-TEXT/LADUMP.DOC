         LADUMP.101 is a revision of the original screen dump program for
         Digital's LA50, LA100 and LA210 printers.  It dumps a screen in
         slightly less than four minutes.  Lines 0-1 should be deleted
         before using it as a subroutine within a program.  Line 0 is a
         comment line and line 1 creates a screen to print as a demo.
         LADUMP downloads at 801 bytes as a do file.  It is 432 bytes as a
         BASIC program iwth lines 0-1 deleted.  Checksum =47,038

         To use LADUMP, it should be merged to a BASIC program by loading
         the program you wish to merge it with and then type MERGE
         "LADUMP".  When run, it will then print the screen to the LA
         printer and return to the program.

         Also, somewhere in your program, (at the beginning) you will have
         to DIMXX%(239) for this subroutine to work.  You can't put it in
         the subroutine or you will wipe out all the variables in your
         program when it is called.

         If you are using an LA printer with the M100 but are using the
         parallel port with a parallel to serial converter, change line
         60000 to open "LPT:" instead of the COM port.  If you are using
         the COM port, most LA printers come factory set at 4800 baud.  If
         you are using a different baud rate (i.e. switched the DIP
         switches) you will have to also change line 60000.  LA50 users
         may have to set the graphic aspect ratio to get the proper
         proportions on the printout (Swith 5 on the first set of switches
         inside the cover)

         The pixel tester used is courtesy of Neil Wicks, who also revised
         this program, performing minor miracles to make it both much
         smaller and a lot faster

         Good Luck
