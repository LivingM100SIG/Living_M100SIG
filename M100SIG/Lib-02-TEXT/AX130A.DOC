                                     AX130A.DOC

             Well it seems Tandy decided to drop the price of the DMP130A
        Dot Matrix Printer for Christmas 87.

             Oops... Santa came early for me this year but for all you
        M100SIG members that find the DMP130A under the tree and want to
        use it right after the wrapping paper hits the floor, the switches
        get set, the cables are hooked up and the power switch is on then
        AX130A.BA is your answer.

             AX130A.BA allows simple key-stroke program access and
        execution of the complete set of print font styles and character
        widths as found on page thirty (30) of the Tandy Dot Matrix Printer
        DMP130A  Operation Manual. There are three possible key answers to
        any font/width that will appear on the M100 screen after you
        download and run AX130A.BA.

        

                           <S>elect the font/style being
                               displayed on the screen.
                                          
                           <M>ore - Show the next font or
                              character style available.
                                          
                           <Q>uit and return to the M100
                                      Main Menu.
