CHRGEN.BA is basically a menu driven program with prompts for all actions.  The one exception to this is in EDIT mode.  When in Edit mode you will see an 8 x 12 grid on the left side of your screen, and a list of prompts on the right.  You start editing any character by simply pressing that key when you reach the edit screen.  A few seconds later a picture of the character already in memory (if any) will appear on the grid to the left.  Simply move around the grid using the I,J,K & M keys turning on and off the PLOTTER, Proportionate Spacing, and Descenders with the P,S, & D keys respectively.  When you are finished with that character you may exit EDIT mode by pressing [ESC] or get another character by pressing [ENTER].

One hint, be sure to use the <C>lear command from the main menu before starting a new character set.  Also save your character set before exiting.  Save to RAM by entering the file name, or any other device by preceding the file name with it's device name, (for example "CAS:CHRSET").


NOTE FOR OTHER PRINTER OWNERS:

If your printer supports a downloadable character font, CHRGEN.BA can be adapted for your needs.  Lines 900-930 to reflect the codes required by your printer.
