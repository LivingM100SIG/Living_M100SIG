  I. GENERAL
     A. While there are many TEXT formatters available for the
        Tandy laptops, none of them works quite like ZIPFMT.  This
        program's main advantages are: very small size, machine
        language speed, and the creation of formatted documents =in
        RAM=, for easy output to a printer or, via TELCOM, to
        another computer, EMail service, or FAX receiver.
     B. The significant difference between ZIPFMT and other
        formatters: instead of using a large program that asks for
        various options every time you run it, ZIPFMT creates small
        .CO programs that are pre-set to a single "layout" --
        meaning a user-defined combination of margins and
        line-spacing.  Each of these .CO files is just 142 bytes;
        yet each is a fully self-contained text formatter.  So, if
        you normally use just one or two standard "layouts," you'll
        need just one or two small .CO files to handle your
        formatting chores.
     C. Another important ZIPFMT feature is that it formats files
        "in place" -- letting it handle much larger documents than
        formatters that must copy the original file.

 II. FEATURES
     A. Formatting Options
        1. ZIPFMT gives you control over the following elements:
           a. Left margin
           b. Maximum characters printed per line
              1) the combination of (a) and (b) establish the Right
                 Margin; so you have control over this also
           c. Top margin
           d. Bottom margin
           e. Line spacing
           f. Maximum lines printed per page
              1) the combination of (c), (d), (e) and (f) establish
                 Page Size; so you also control it
     B. Machine Language
        1. The formatter is fast.  It typically handles a 6K file
           (5,000 words) in less than 30 seconds.
     C. AltLCD Operation
        1. Because ZIPFMT works in a "protected" area of system
           memory, it does not conflict with other machine language
           programs, and you don't have to CLEAR space or change
           HIMEM.
     D. Formatting "In Place"
        1. Since ZIPFMT doesn't copy the document it's processing,
           you can work with very large files.
     E. Versatility
        1. Rather than dumping output to an external device, ZIPFMT
           creates a formatted TEXT file in the computer's memory.
           This lets you:
           a. send files to a printer with the "Save to: LPT:"
              option in TEXT -- which (unlike SHIFT/PRINT) will
              pass along printer control codes
           b. send completely formatted files via TELCOM.
     F. Size
        1. Each of the .CO files is a self-contained TEXT formatter
           --  but takes just 142 bytes of memory.

III. INSTALLATION
     A. You need to download either ZIPFMT.100 or ZIPFMT.200,
        depending on which laptop you have.
     B. Your new file contains listings for =two= programs:
        ZIPFMT.BA and ZIPFIX.BA.  Separate these into individual
        .DO files, then convert them to .BA programs.
        1. ZIPFMT.BA is the program you'll use to create a new
           formatter if you =don't= already have one on the menu.
        2. Once you have made a formatter, you can use a shorter
           program, ZIPFIX.BA, to change it -- or to create new
           formatters as explained below.

 IV. STARTING OUT
     A. Whenever you want to make a ZIPFMT .CO file, but don't have
        one in your computer, you need to use ZIPFMT.BA
        1. Run it as you would run any BASIC program from the main
           menu
        2. The first display will show a rapidly changing number in
           the middle of your screen, as the program loads machine
           language data to the proper addresses
        3. Next, you'll see the "layout" menu for a formatting file
           a. it is the "default" file that ZIPFMT.BA just loaded,
              and it is pre-set to a format of:

              1)     Left Margin:   [  5]
                     Printed Chrs:  [ 34]
                     Top Margin:    [  3]
                     Bottom Margin: [  4]
                     Spc Btw Lines: [  0]
                     Printed Lines: [ 59]

        4. With these settings displayed on the screen, the cursor
           will be flashing next to the first option, Left Margin:
           a. to change the setting, enter a new number
              1) the change appears on your screen
           b. to accept the setting as shown, press <ENTER>
        5. Continue, as in the previous step, through all the
           formatting elements -- defined as:
           a.  Margin - number of spaces before the first text
              character in each line
           b. Printed Chars - maximum number of text characters in
              each line
           c. Top Margin - number of carriage-return / linefeed
              combinations at the top of each page
           d. Bottom Margin - number of CR/LF's at the bottom of
              each page
           e. Spc Btw Lines - number of CR/LF's between each line
              of printed text
              1) this number will be 0 for single-spacing, 1 for
                 double-spacing, and so forth
           f. Printed Lines - maximum number of actual text lines
              printed on each page
        6. As you set various options, you'll see two important
           numbers re-calculate on the first line of your screen.
           a. LinSiz  - indicating the =total= size of a line,
              including Left Margin and Printed Chars
              1) this is equivalent to a Right Margin
           b. PgSiz - indicating the =total= number of lines
              printed on a page, including Top and Bottom Margins,
              Printed Lines, and Spc Btw Lines:
              1) final adjustments to Page Size should be made with
                 the 'Printed Lines' setting.  PgSiz should total
                 66 for most printers.  If your printer is set to
                 'skip over perf,' or you're printing on special
                 forms, you may have to experiment.
        7. After you've finished with the range of format choices,
           you'll be given an "OK? (Y/N)" prompt.  Answering with
           anything other than 'Y' or 'y' at this point will take
           you back through the settings for further changes;
           otherwise ....
        8. You'll see the final prompt:

                Save to  #_____.CO

                 NOTE:  Throughout this document, the symbol
                 '#', as in #_____.CO, above, is used in place
                 of a graphics character that will actually be
                 shown on your computer (but will not transmit
                 properly in this ASCII file).  The character
                 will be a 'Paragraph' symbol, which looks like
                 a 'P' in reverse.  It is used as a reminder of
                 what the ZIPFMT files do.
                    Also for the purposes of this document,
                 the formatting files beginning with this
                 character will be known interchangeably as
                 "#files," or "layout files," or simply
                 "formatters."

        9. This is where you enter a name for the layout file
           you've just customized:
           a. any name of five characters or fewer will work,
              though you should probably use something that reminds
              you of what the layout is for: #FAX.CO, or #MEMO.CO,
              for example
           b. you might also want to use numbers, indicating the
              left margin and line-length: #5/65.CO
       10. If you enter a 'null string' (by just pressing <ENTER>)
           at the "Save to:" prompt, nothing will happen; you'll
           just return to the main menu, with no #file created.

  V. USING ZIPFIX.BA
     A. This program is about half the size of ZIPFMT.BA, and it's
        intended for use when you already have a #file on the menu.
        With ZIPFIX, you can change the settings of an existing
        #file -- or create a brand new one by using one of the
        existing formatters as a "seed."
        1. These are the principles to keep in mind:
           a. You change a seed file if you answer the "Save to:"
              prompt with the file's own name
           b. If you respond with any other name, you'll create a
              new #file, and the seed file will remain unchanged
     B. Run ZIPFIX.BA from the main menu
        1. The first screen will show you a list of files and
           prompt for the name of a "Source:"
           a. this is what we've been calling a "seed file," and it
              must be an existing formatter
        2. When the screen changes, you'll see the seed file's
           layout settings and you can change them to suit your new
           format
           a. See detailed instructions in Section IV.
        3. If you respond with 'Y' or 'y' at the OK? prompt, you'll
           get the "Save to:" prompt for naming a new layout or (by
           saving the seed file to itself) changing the seed file
           a. Again, a null entry at this prompt will take you back
              to the main menu with no changes made

 VI. APPLICATIONS
     A. Because ZIPFMT creates formatted, .DO files =in RAM=, it
        lets you do some things that weren't possible before:
        1. Printer
           a. Instead of using <SHIFT><PRINT> to send files to a
              printer you can now use <F3>, designating "LPT:" as
              the output device
              1) this means you can send printer control codes --
                 to underline, overstrike, or change fonts -- by
                 embedding the controls as you write a document
                 (see the TEXT section of your computer manual for
                 more on this).
        2. TEXT
           a. You can use the left and right margins to configure
              your .DO files for easiest reading, or to make room
              for notes alongside the main body of the document.
        3. TELCOM
           a. while you could previously specify a right margin (at
              the "Width:" prompt) when sending files to another
              computer, there was no provision for left margins or
              page sizes
           b. ZIPFMT lets you add those elements to a file =before=
              sending it
              1) this is especially useful for sending professional
                 looking documents via FAX

VII. TECHNICAL NOTES
     A. Size Limits
        1. ZIPFMT's "in place" formatting technique lets it work
           with larger files than most other formatters, but there
           is a limit: when you add formatting to a file, the size
           increases -- and it's possible to run out of RAM.
           a. If this happens, the formatter will beep, flash a
              "Memory full" message on the screen, and return to
              the main menu.
           b. With most layouts, you can avoid this problem by
              allowing a 20% overhead for the file being formatted;
              i.e., you would want 200 bytes of free memory to
              format a 1,000 byte file.  If you're using a format
              that calls for very wide left margins, this overhead
              will increase.
     B. Unformatting
        1. DEFORM
           a. A while ago, I wrote a machine language program that
              strips left margins and most "soft" carriage returns
              from formatted .DO files.  It's called DEFORM (in
              different versions for the M100/102 and T200
              laptops), and it works quite nicely on documents that
              have been formatted with ZIPFMT -- in case you want
              to convert them back to original form.
     C. Tabs
        1. ZIPFMT will not work properly on files that use the TAB
           character to indent paragraphs or set up columns of
           data.  If you need to format such files, you can use
           another (100 byte) machine language routine, called
           ZAPTAB, to replace TABs with an appropriate number of
           spaces; then ZIPFMT will work as you'd expect.

III. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
     A. Beta Testing
        1. Randy Hess gets credit for suggesting (strongly) that a
           program like ZIPSRT might be useful.  He was also kind
           enough to invent problems that the earliest generations
           of ZIPFMT couldn't solve.

 IX. SUPPORT
     A. Message Board vs. EPlex
        1. For questions or suggestions concerning ZIPFMT, contact
           me on the M100 Forum.  Rathern than EMail, I would
           prefer open correspondence on the SIG message board
           because it lets more people know -- more efficiently --
           about the program's strong points and weaknesses.
           Thanks.
