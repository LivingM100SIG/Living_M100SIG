	Use LOADER.ASM to convert PRT10X.SRC to any filename you wish.
The program sits at 62000 to 62550.  It is intended only for the personal use
of (and improvement by) members of the Model 100 SIG.

	PRT10X is a print formatting program for the Gemini 10X printer.
It should work with all compatible printers.
	This program allows you to change the print mode within the body
of your text file.  Selecting the mode is done by inserting graphic characters
into your text.  Instead of the graphic character being printed, it is
converted into the appropriate command sequence for the printer.
	Remember that the graphics characters take up room on the display,
but not on the printout, so you may have to experiment to get a neat looking
printout.

	When you run the program, you will be prompted for the filename.
You must supply the .DO suffix.  The program will hang if the printer is
not ready.

Embedded Command Summary
------------------------
GRAPH-pn......Select print pitch, where n is a digit from 1 to 3:
	        1 = Pica
	        2 = Elite
	        3 = Condensed
GRAPH-i.......Italics mode.
GRAPH-s.......Standard mode.
GRAPH-e.......Emphasized mode toggle.
GRAPH-u.......Underline mode toggle.
GRAPH-w.......Double-Wide mode toggle.
GRAPH-f.......Send a form-feed.
 CODE-sn......Super- or Subscript, where n is a digit from 0 to 2:
		0 = Superscript.
		1 = Subscript.

	The toggle commands work like on-off switches.  The first appearance
of the command turns that mode on, the next off, and so on.  Some modes may
conflict, check the printer owner's manual.
