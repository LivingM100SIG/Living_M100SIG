***Yet Another Text Formatter***

Yes, text formatters are a dime a dozen, but this one solves a few problems I
had printing text files on my Epson LX-80 printer. First, its adds a line-feed
to each carriage return, so I don't have to change the switch settings on the 
printer each time I want to print from my M100. Second, it supports the Near-
Letter Quality (NLQ) mode of the LX-80, sending the correct control codes to
the printer to set it in the NLQ mode.

All ram files are displayed, and you are prompted for the file to print. If you
mistype the filename, an error message is displayed, and the file menu is
displayed again.

You are then prompted for left and fight margins; default settings of column 11
and 75 are shown. If different margins are desired, just enter them, left
first, then right, seperated by a comma.

You can place a header at the top of each page; after you enter the header,
you are asked whether you want the header printed on the first page.

Finally, you are asked whether the NLQ mode is desired.
Pressing the enter key at any prompt selects the default setting. After you
answer the last prompt, printing begins.
At the end of the first page, you can press enter for the next page, or "N"
for continuous printing. When the document is printed, you are returned to
the M100 menu.

Placing a <GRPH>p anywhere in the text forces a page break.

This program is a modification of the NEWPRT.100 program that appears in Orson
Kellogg's book "The Radio Shack Notebook Computer"

This is my first M100 upload; I hope its usefull to some Epson/M100 users.
