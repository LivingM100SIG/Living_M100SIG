    I've  been  using  this very short program due to memory economics. Weighs 
    in @ 265 bytes. Less for the M200. 

    No bells, whistles or fancy screens - Just a good printer utility. 

    Uses my 6 most printer fonts. Easily modified to your needs. As is set  up 
    for RS DMP105, but should work on all DMP printers. 


                                  Modus Operandi 

    1. Make sure printer is ON 

    2.  F7  key disables Elongate, Compressed. & Bold (same as turning printer 
    off. 

    3. You can mix different functions - e.g. - Elongate/Compressed/Bold etc. 

    4. DMP105 users, Compressed/Bold is a good looking NLQ. See hint below. 

    5. Model 200 users: 
                      change line #1 to just CLS 
                      line #2 to PRINT@600 
                      line #13 to just MENU 
                  lines 1 & 13 - you just delete the Calls as  they  are  M100 
    specific  &  not  needed  in  the M200. (the calls are to disable & enable 
    screen scrolling in the M100)] 

    6. Hint: If your printer is printing 0 instead of O, see  "ONOT0.BA"  this 
    SIG. for a more 'professional' touch.
