                  (C) 1985 - Paul Papanek Stork

TXTFMT.CO is a machine language text formatting program for the MODEL 100
portable computer.  It allows you to Open, Edit and Kill .DO files without
ever leaving the program.  Besides these functions it supports a full range
of formatting and printing capabilities.  Below you will find a list of 20
special commands which can be imbedded directly in any .DO file.  There are
also default settings for Left Margin, Page Width, Top Margin, Bottom Margin,
Line Spacing and Stop Between Pages which can be reset from the menu.

But the best thing about TXTFMT.CO is the price.  Since it is being offered
as SHAREWARE the price is only $20.  Use the program for a couple of weeks.
If you don't agree that it's one of the best NON-ROM based formatters around
just erase it from your memory, and it doesn't cost you a dime.  But if you
agree that it's a real value, then please register your support by sending $20
to:

                      Aniwa, WI  54408

In return I will send you the following:
        1. A full manual, explaining all of the features of TXTFMT.CO
        2. A utility program to install the codes from your own printer
           (currently it's set to operate on an Epson FX-80)
        3. A registration certificate which entitles you to all future
           updates for the cost of postage and materials.
           (Supply your own cassette and prepaid mailer and they are FREE)
        4. Any special version of the program which you need.
           For example, one assembled below DOS for DVI or Chipmunk.
           You tell me your special needs and I will try to fill
           them, again only for the price of Postage and Supplies.

Just try TXTFMT.CO for two weeks if you don't like it, then just throw it
away.  But if you do like it then why not register, and pass it on to your
friends.  They may need a good fast TEXT Formatter as much as you do.

                              Sincerely Yours,

                           USING TXTFMT.CO's MENUS
                           -----------------------

    TXTFMT.CO is run almost entirely by function keys and menus.  Each major
function is accessed by pressing a function key from the main menu.  You will
then be asked to supply a file name to be processed.  Press <ENTER> if you
want to use the default name printed in reverse.  Press <Shift><Break> if you
changed your mind about using this function.  Or enter the name of a new file
to work on.  The ".DO" extension is not necessary.  That's all there is to it.
From this point on simply follow the prompts, and respond appropriately

    One last thing, if you're in the middle of something, and you want to
abort it, just press <ESC>.  That should return you to the Main TXTFMT.CO
menu.
