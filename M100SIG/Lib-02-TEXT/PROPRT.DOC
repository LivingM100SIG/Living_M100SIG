PROPRT.BA  is a program to give fully justified and proportional printing.  It 
was written for a Citizen 120D printer.  Since that printer claims 
compatibility with the Epson FX series, it should run on those and many others.


The program in PROPRT.BA is not a full word processor or text formatter. It is 
merely an experiment at a code sending algorithm for fully utilizing the 
proportional spacing, and proportional printing capabilities that are built 
into many printers.  I had observed that none of the Word processors I have 
used are capable of doing a true, typeset style of justification, even though 
the tools for doing so are built into my printer.  So I potched together this 
little doodad, and I hope that one of the more serious programmers will someday
build it into a better word processor.

To operate, enter the left margin width, body text width, and yes or no to 
proportional.  The program will use either proportional or regular width type, 
depending on you selection, and space it out with micro-spaces of 120ths of an 
inch between letters.

The program runs slowly because it's in basic.  But if you use NLQ, you'll 
hardly notice it.

Try it!
