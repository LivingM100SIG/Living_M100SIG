 
When output to line printer was used with COLUMN.100, it was found that
an erroneous (and never ending!) output was encountered.  This problem
was traced to Line 880 in the program.
 
To correct the problem, delete Line 880 in COLUMN.100
 
A corrected listing of COLUMN.100 has been uploaded as COLUMN.101
