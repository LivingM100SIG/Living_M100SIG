PURPOSE

  This program will allow you to print documentation on both sides of the page.
The output can be put in a binder like a book (saving paper in the bargain). It
was specifically designed for printing the POWR-DOS documents but can also be
used for other DOC files.


PROCEDURE

  The document to be printed must have a ^L (Ctrl-L) where every new page is to
start.  The program creates two output files called "ODD.DO" and "EVEN.DO" to
hold the odd and even pages.  You can then edit the odd file (with TEXT) and
then select F3 (save) and reply LPT: to save to the printer.  When the file is
printed, remove the paper from the printer and reverse it.  Then edit the even
file and save it to the printer (F3 and reply LPT:).  NOTE-Delete the first ^L
at the beginning of EVEN.DO since you will already have aligned the paper to
the start of the first even page.


COMMENTS

  This is a very simple program with no error checking. Make sure you specify
the correct name of the file to be split.  Also, make sure your printer is
ready before starting.  The word-wrap doesn't work when you save to a printer
so the file must be preformated to the correct line length.
   You must have enough RAM to have two copies of the doc in memory, or you can
read the input from cassette or disk (input name of CAS:xxxx.DO or 0:xxxx.DO).
   To add ^L to your own documents you must enter a ^P^L.  The ctrl-P indicates
that the following is a printer code.

Hope you find this useful.
