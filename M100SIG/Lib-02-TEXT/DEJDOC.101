
Dejah (Who call's herself Deety) is my version of Clyde/Moe/Deety.  It 
requires SUBLIB.CO because I find the file length data useful.  (SUBLIB.CO is
generated by running SUBLDR.100 found in DL7, LIBDOC.100 also in DL7 explains
other uses.)

Dejah is faster than Deety, but the "personality" is not a separate file, 
making changes more difficult.  It's advantage is that it parses the entire 
input string, Thus allowing lines like "Hi good lookin, what time is it, and 
thanks for doing nice work."

Dejah will respond to Hi, Good, Looking, Time, Thanks, and Nice in sequence.

Wherever possible I stole routines since I am inherently lazy.  Thanks and
appreciation to sources too numerous to mention but especially to Larry Gensch
for Moe, and Howard Benner for aid with the punctuation deleter.

A typical conversation goes like this:

Good evening, Boss.  Deety here.
Good evening Deety.
What's up, Chief?
Remove quick.do and thanks
Are you sure you want me to remove
file "QUICK.DO"?
? y
Consider QUICK.DO zapped!
Anytime, Chief.

Some of the lines in the program are quite long and get broken in uploading.
  Patch these carefully in the text file since at least one (2670) will
generate a spurious line that supplants a real program line.

Watching the load line 710 had a gosub that got garbled, lines 1000, 1750, 
1770, 1910, 2670, and 4050 looked like they got split.

The keywords are in line 4050 and are five upper case characters long.  Each 
one relates to a subroutine in the same relative position in line 2670.

To add to Dejah just write a subroutine and place the key word/words in 4050 
and the subroutine entrance line # in the same place in 2670.  Key words must
be FIVE characters long UPPER case. (As in THANK for Thanks or GOODN for 
Goodnight.)

Some words cause Dejah to look at the following word.  Good looks for 
Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.  Good also looks for Looking.  (Goodnight 
shuts the machine off.)  Kill Delete and Remove act on the following word,
as do Phone, Call, Dial, and Find.  Phone, Call, and Dial will accept a 
number, or scan ADRS.DO (slowly!!!  Anyone know how to invoke Find/Search 
routine in the monitor for this application???)

Using Kill or Remove to delete a BASIC program pops you out of Dejah and into 
BASIC for some reason I am not clever enough to deal with (yet).  Works fine 
with Text files and possibly .CO files but I haven't tried it since I want my 
only .CO file.

For those who are interested, the core of the program runs from 1900 to 5000 
and an opening line saying GOTO 4000 must be added.  The IF statement in 
line 2350 extracts the appropriate response from the Wake Up routine.  N 
never equals "0" again.

Have fun SIG members.  Thanks for all the great stuff on the DL's.  I hope 
this is partial payment.
