Following control characters may be
embedded in a text file.  Place each
control character at the beginning of
a line by itself:

   [GRAPH][p] - Start a new page

   [GRAPH][c] - Center a line of text
                that follows
                (line length must be
                smaller than margin
                width)

   [GRAPH][w] - Turns on right
                justification.

   [GRAPH][q] - Turns off right
                justification

   [GRAPH][t] - Change single spacing
                to double spacing, and
                vice versa

   [GRAPH][m](left margin value)[-]
   (right margin value)[GRAPH][m]
              - Reset side margins
                (margins must be
                integers; no space
                between characters)

* Control characters override the menu
  settings.
* In case you are reading this file
  in upper case only, above control
  characters should be [GRAPH]
  (lower case letters).


You may embed printer control codes as
described on page 60 of Model 100
manual (using CTRL-P).
You may also define printer control
codes in the program.  In order to
define codes, you have to enter the
number of control codes in line 132
and add DATA after line 200 in form
of:

DATA (decimal value of the assigned
character),(length of the control
code),(decimal value(s) of the code),

Example:
ESC-X starts underlining and ESC-Y
stops underlining on CITOH 8501A
printer, and you assign GRAPH-X for
underlining on and GRAPH-Y for off.
Since GRAPH-X has a decimal value of
239, ESC-X takes 2 character length,
dec val of ESC is 27 and "X" is 88, and
GRAPH-Y has a dec val of 254, ESC-Y
takes 2 character length, dec val of
ESC is 27 and "Y" is 89, line 132 and
200 will look like this:

132 ......:Z=2
200 DATA 239,2,27,88,254,2,27,89

* Be sure not to use those characters
  used as control characters in WORPRO.

* Both embedding codes using CTRL-P
  and defining codes in the program
  will affect right justification.

If your memory permits, it is good idea
to output a formatted file to RAM with
right justification, then embed printer
control codes using CTRL-P.  Then you
print the file by using [F3], Save to:
LPT: or etc.

The program has a multiple copy
feature, but outputting original file
to RAM and printing copies of it takes
much less time.


To change initial menu defaults, edit
line 132, which reads:

  132 M(0)=10:M(1)=70:M(2)=6:M(3)=60:
  F=66:S=1:A=0:C=0:D=0:E=0:R=0:P=1:
  N=1:Z=0

M(0-3):  Margins
  Enter positive integers
  Right margin must be bigger than left
  margin, and bottom margin must be
  bigger than top margin and smaller
  than form length.
    M(0) - left margin value
    M(1) - right margin value
    M(2) - top margin value
    M(3) - bottom margin value

F:  Form length
  Enter positive integer bigger than
  bottom margin

S:  Line spacing
  Enter 1 or 2

A:  Output
  Enter 0 for <P>arallel printer
        1 for <S>erial printer
        2 for LCD
        3 for RAM file
        4 for Cassette

C:  Pause between pages
  Enter 0 for no pause
        1 for pause

D:  Page numbering (1st page)
  Enter 0 for no page numbering
        1 for number at top
        2 for number at bottom

E:  Page numbering (Rest of pages)
  Enter 0 for no page numbering
        1 for number at top
        2 for number at bottom

R:  Right justification
  Enter 0 for off
        1 for on

P:  Starting page number
  Enter positive integer

N:  Number of copies
  Enter positive integer

Z:  Number of printer control codes
    you defined after line 200
  Enter positive integer less than 255


* For serial printer output, you must
  enter your printer's configuration
  in line 45.  See page 165 of M100
  manual for detail.

* Be sure to end a text file with
  carriage return, or WORPRO will not
  read the last line.


Thanks to Sysop Dave Thomas and other
SIG members who have given me good
suggestions and support.


Any comments on the program will be
appreciated.
