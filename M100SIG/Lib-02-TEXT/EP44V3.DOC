    This is a re-write of the EP4V2.100 submitted by Richard Helman 70536,1061.
With the exception of line spacing and page numbering all formating controls 
can be imbedded within the body of the text.
.
    Both margins can be reset at any time along with page length (5-60 lines). 
Up to ten tabs stops can be specified [must be in ascending sequence no check 
is made].  Tabbing is performed using the <TAB> key itself rather than a multiple 
key sequence.
.
    Inorder to prevent transmitting data faster than the EP44 can process 
it the data is formated into approximately two print line groups.  Also transmit 
speed is limited to 300 baud.
.
    A new feature added to the program is a graphic representation of the 
format of the printed page.  This display is generated during the formating 
process.  If you wish to check the layout of your document before making a 
hardcopy do not active the EP44.
.
    Tokenized the program is 3,558 bytes long.  The documentation for the 
formating control codes is contained in DATA statments at the end of the program. 
If you delete lines 500-580 the program shrinks to approx. 2,861 bytes.  [Also 
change 210 to a RETURN and delete 211-290]  To improve performance the CLEAR 
statement is set to 2,000, minimum size is 600.
