	INTRODUCTION

    HYPHEN.100 is a companion program to FORMAT.100. It has two functions. First, it reads a text file and tells you how many 
lines of N characters it will take to print it out with FORMAT.
    Second, HYPHEN.100 can check each line of output, to determine if it is too long. If so, HYPHEN.100 displays the line and 
lets you edit it, before writing it out to a new file.

	USING HYPHEN.100

    HYPHEN.100 creates a new file called RECEIVE.DO, which contains the hyphenated document. HYPHEN.100 first asks which file 
you want, and then asks if you just want a line count.
    If you type <y>, RECEIVE is opened as a dummy file only, and no text is put into it. Otherwise, HYPHEN.100 asks if you want
the hyphenated file on tape. If you type <y>, the program opens CAS:RECEIVE as the new file (make sure you have a tape recorder
hooked up in record mode). Otherwise, you must have enough free memory for the hyphenated file to go in RAM.
    The program then asks how many characters you want to a line. Remember that HYPHEN.100 is supposed to read text like 
FORMAT, so it won't automatically word-wrap long words. If you are just counting lines, the program runs until the text has 
been scanned and displays the line lenth and count.
    If you chose hyphenating, the program automatically writes a copy of your text file into RECEIVE.DO until it hits a line 
which would be more than two characters longer than your 'line length'. It displays that line, stops and beeps for your 
attention.
    Press any key and a truncateed version of the line also appears, followed by a <_>. That is where the 'edited' line would 
be cut off. A vertical arrow marks the point corresponding to the desired line length.
    At the bottom of the screen are the editing commands:
    <SPACE> adds another character from the long line to the 'edit' line.
    <ENTER> simply copies the entire long line to the 'edit' line and returns to the main routine (in case you want to override
the machine's judgement).
    <-> adds a hyphen and a blank to the end of the edited line, and returns to the copy routine. The text in RECEIVE will now 
have a hyphen+space in between the text at that point.
    <b> just adds a blank and returns.
    <x> doesn't alter the 'edit' line, but will force a line break at that point. It then returns to the main program. For 
example, if the phrase 'hyphen+space' ran over the end of a line, <x> could be used to cut it in two.

    After the entire text file has been scanned and edited, HYPHEN.100 will display the number of lines of print it will take. 
FORMAT should be used to print out RECEIVE.DO.

	CUSTOMIZING

    If you alter FORMAT, you should modify HYPHEN.100 as well:
    If you change the word-break value from '4' in FORMAT (line 2300), change the same numbers in lines 300 and 550 of 
HYPHEN.100.
    If you change the underline or backspace characters in FORMAT, change line 70 in HYPHEN.100 accordingly.
    You can change the line length limits in HYPHEN.100 without modifying FORMAT. The range of acceptable lengths is set by '6'
in line 200. You can adjust this up or down as you wish-- lower ranges will give you a tighter right margin, but you'll have to
edit more lines. Higher ranges will reduce editing, but give a sloppier margin.
    You may also alter the point at which you start editing lines by changing the expressions "SU-2"in line 600 and "SU-1" in 
line 640 (the latter expression should always be one larger than the former).
