

PTXTX.BA and PTXTX.ML are merge programs to add enhancements to Woods Martin's 
excellent PRTEXT.BA formatting program in  DL2. They each add the same two 
features:

1) Ability to print selected pages.  This is handy if your printer misfeeds or 
you need to make a spelling correction in the middle of a long document.

2) Preview feature which draws a tiny image of the completed page on the screen
with a black pixel for each letter.

To install, simply down load ONE of the two programs (see below) and MERGE with
a copy of PRTEXT.BA version 2.2a in RAM.  Once merged, save the resulting 
program to tape or disk as new PRTEXT.  The new program will function exactly 
as before except:

1) It will prompt for pages to print just before printing.  To print the entire
document, simply hit [enter], else type in the page numbers desired separated 
by spaces.

2) If you enter "DISP" for the output device (instead of a file name or 'P' for
printer) the formatted output will go to the screen in a pixel drawing instead 
of output.

Which to use? (Identification of each merge file is on line #105, this remains 
in place when program is merged).

PTXTX.BA is written entirely in Basic and will cause no known conflict with 
other resident programs in hi-RAM (such as TS-DOS, Power-Disk etc.  It is also 
somewhat smaller in bytes.

PTXTX.ML is identical in function except that a machine language call is poked 
in just below MAXRAM and used to place the pixels on the screen, substantially 
speeding up the pixel display (since the actual formatting is still in Basic, 
that places the only limit on how fast a page can be displayed on the screen). 
PTXTX.ML can be used with all tape systems as well as disk systems such as 
Acroatrix Power-Dos which do not locate in hi-RAM.  If you use Floppy.co or 
Dskmgr.co to move files to and from disk there should be no conflict as long as
you keep the .CO file in memory and select it from the menu for your next 
access to disk.  Since PTXTX.ML resets HIMEM it will be necessary to CLEAR 
space for these programs again before using.

There is no reason why the routine in .ML cannot be reassembled to sit below 
memory resident programs, and if there is interest I can upload alternate 
versions for TS-DOS etc. as well.  (Possibly even a relocatable version 
eventually if I get enough time to play with it).  Please contact me via Email 
if you are interested, or if you would like a copy of the assembly source.

One final point.  Since these were designed to 'hook' onto PRTEXT with minimal 
reworking, they represent a 'patch' rather than a well integrated change.  
Woods has indicated that he may incorporate these changes at a later date if 
there seems to be interest, therefore this represents an interim solution and a
sort of trial balloon for future versions of PRTEXT.
