EP44V2.100 is an update of the Brother EP44 Printer/Typewriter print format
program previously submitted as EP44.100 in this section.  Thanks to those
who submitted suggestions and additions from the original.  New features have
been added as well as no longer using the "typewriter" code, which seemed to
have some problems when used with this program.  Version 2 uses the terminal
(8 BIT) code as well as including some additional features.  It also allows
use of additional EP44 characters if they are imbedded in a TEXT file.

To use EP44V2, put the EP44 in the terminal mode and make certain it is set
up according to the description on the first screen of the program.  Use the
RS-232 cabling as recommended in the manual.  Insert first sheet of paper
and set for proper top margin.

You will be prompted for the NAME OF FILE TO BE FORMATTED, LEFT MARGIN WIDTH,
RIGHT MARGIN WIDTH, PAGE LENGTH, PAGE NUMBERING and DOUBLE SPACE.
If Page numbering or double spacing is desired, enter 'Y' at the prompt.
IMPORTANT: .DO file MUST be in memory before running the program AND MUST end
with a CR.

There are three control codes which can be imbedded in text before running the
program:
     1. UNDERLINING - To start underlining, immediately PRECEDE the word to be
underlined with <CTRL>'P'<CTRL>'U'.  To end underlining, FOLLOW the word with
the same coding.  It is best to underline each word separately, unless you are
certain the sentence or phrase will not wrap around because you will get a left
margin of underlining without characters.
     2. LINE CENTERING - To center a line for headings, etc., start the line by
entering ,<GRPH>'C'. End the line with <ENTER>. (Note: This centers the line
within the "CURRENT" left-margin and right-margin settings.)
     3. RESETTING LEFT-MARGIN - It is possible to reset the left-margin within
the TEXT file by using <GRPH>'I' AND <GRAPH>'O'. IMPORTANT: Set the new left-
margin at the END of the line PREVIOUS to the line to be printed with the new
left-margin.  There should be NO SPACES between the end of this line and the
<GRPH> codes to reset the margin!  To move the margin in from its present
setting, use <GRPH>'I' to move one space.  Repeat as necessary.  To move the
margin back out, use <GRPH>'O' as many times as necessary.

EXAMPLE:
     We will now move the margin in three spaces.<GRPH>'I'<GRPH>'I'<GRPH>'I'
        Ok, this is the line moved in three spaces.  Now, we will move the line
        back out three spaces.<GRPH>'O'<GRPH>'O'<GRPH>'O'
     This new line is back to where it was set before. End.

NOTE: For graphics purposes on the Model 100, it would be convenient to use
<GRPH>'l' and <GRPH>'k' (right arrow and left arrow) to move the margin, but
these are available on the EP44 as additional characters, if desired.

In order to see how the EP44 printer interprets <GRPH> and <CODE> characters
run the following program and try the different combinations.  Use the same
EP44 settings as on the first screen of EP44V2.100 **EXCEPT** "NEW LINE"
SHOULD BE 'CR'.  This will print EP44 "2nd Shift" characters.
          10 CLS
          20 OPEN"COM:58N1E"FOROUTPUTAS1
          30 A$=INPUT$(1):PRINTA$;:PRINT#1,A$;:GOTO30
You will see a lot of "foreign" characters printed as well as some useful
characters for printing on the EP44.  Checksum for EP44V2 is: 123,665.
