    I have found the think.it program for the M100 from DL2  to
be very helpful.  But, I have often wanted to transfer the work I
have started on the M100 to my IBM PC where I could work on it in
either Ready! or ThinkTank (Outline processors from Living Videotext).
These programs should enable you to convert the file formats in
either direction.  It is a one-step process on the IBM PC for
files from the M100.  It is a two-step process for files from the 
IBM PC: one-step on the PC another on the M100;

     I hope these programs will increase the usefulness of your M100.

     Let me know of any problems.  I would appreciate any reactions.

    THNKREDY and REDYTHNK were written in Turbo Pascal and 
 compiled on their version 3.0 compiler.  CNVRT.RM is a BASIC 
listing to be loaded in BASIC on your M100 and saved as a ".ba" 
program.  The programs read the headings of each line and convert 
to the format used by the other programs.

                  ******************************

To convert a think.it file on the IBM PC use THNKREDY.COM
To convert a Ready! file or a structured textfile created by 
ThinkTank use REDYTHNK.COM on the PC, tranfer to your M100, 
then use CNVRT on your M100.

                  ******************************

THNKREDY.COM

    Transmit THINK.IT file to IBM PC.

    The syntax for the program is > THNKREDY [drivepath]filename

The drive and/or path name is optional if on the current logged drive.
The file name is the name of the file to be converted.  If no extension
is given, ".txt" is assumed.  The new file will have the same name but
with the extension ".rdy."  It should be able to be read by Ready! or 
imported as a structured textfile by ThinkTank.  Original file remains 
unchanged.

REDYTHNK.COM

     Syntax > REDYTHNK [drivepath]filename

     The drive and/or pathname is optional is on current logged 
drive.  The filename is the name of the file to be converted.  It should 
be a Ready! file or a structured textfile created by ThinkTank (Headers 
only, no documents attached!).  If no extension is given ".rdy" is 
assumed.  The new file will have the same name but with the extension 
".txt" (unless the original file extension is ".txt," then it will have 
the extension ".doc."  The orignal file remains unchanged.

     Transmit the new file to your M100 and finish the conversion 
by running CNVRT.RM (cnvrt.ba).

CNVRT.RM

     First, convert to BASIC (see above).

    Run on M100.  Enter filename with extension at prompt.  File 
translation will be completed.  Replaces original file with the 
converted file.  Needs about 3k to run.  Present limit is 500 lines 
and 2,000 bytes.  Change line 1 if more (or less) string space or 
lines are needed.
