On the Radios Shack 1400, the standard IBM printer cable will not work on the
early RS printers. These printers are:  DMP 106, 107, 130, 132, 133. To use the
1400 on these printers you leave the Dip Switches on _Tandy Mode_ (not IBM mode)
The correct cable is RS# 26-0227 (6') and RS# 26-0223 (12').
DMP 134 and up require RS# 26-0228 (6') and 26-1258 (12'); I assume the last two
mentioned are standard cables that sell at RS for $34.95+ and I purchased one at
a computer retail store for $8.95. (Thanks Tony!). Hope this save someone a little frustration on "moving-up".
