UPDWN.DOC (UP-DATED 11-26-87 & 12-18-87)

This is the DOCumentation for the UPLD.BAT & DWNLD.BAT ( and now CRLF.BAS)
files.  These are "user-friendly" DOS .BATch files to be run in the IBM-
compatible PC to effect ASCII Text File transfers to/from the Radio Shack
100 series notebook portables.  Both (all three) files can be read or down-
loaded to the M100 and transferred to the PC [use manually-entered MODE &
COPY comds as per the UPLD.BAT file], or down-loaded to the PC from
UPDWN.ARC, and unpack via ARCE.COM or ARC510.EXE.

UPLD.BAT operates at 9600 baud, DWNLD.BAT at 1200 (perhaps there's room for
improvement with different MODE COM... parameters, my M/S DOS manual is weak
in this area, & DWNLD @9600 missed some charactors on the TANDY 102 side).

The MODE.EXE (or .COM) file must reside in the default directory or be
availible via your "PATH."

Read the individual files and/or invoke either with no following parameters
for complete step-by-step instructions.

These programs were developed using a TANDY 102 and a PCs Limited 286-8
running "generic" M/S DOS 3.2. They should be useable as is, with any of the
M100 series machines (100, 102, 200, 300, 600) and any IBM-compatible
running either PC or M/S DOS version 3.1 and later (See below for more on
this).

The TEXT SAVE TO function is not limited by BASIC's 255 byte string limit.
It also adds the linefeed byte [CHR$(10)] after each carriage return
[CHR$(13)] and sends CTRL-Z [CHR$(26)] at the end of the SAVE (TELCOM UP
will do neither automatically).  The files recieved are Normal ASCII text
with CR/LF pairs at the end of each paragraph and Crtl-Z end-of-file
markers.  Most word processor application programs will accept these files.
Re-form the paragraphs and you're ready to go.

BASIC, EDLIN (in the default /a mode), LOTUS 123 /File Import Text, and some
others, will have trouble with those paragraphs longer than 239 or so
charactors. Shorten the paragraphs TEXT mode before sending to the PC or
reformat with your PC Word-Processor program before feeding the files to
these applications.

The use of the "/a" parameter in UPLD.BAT's COPY command adds the CTRL-z
end-of-file marker to the recieved PC file.

The "/b" parameter in DWNLD.BAT's COPY command sends the CTRL-z end-of-file
marker to signal the end of transmission.  If no CTRL-z exists in the file
sent, the "TEXT Load from:.." command will wait for one, requiring you to
manually interupt it with the shift-break combination.  If more than one
Ctrl-z exists in the file sent, "Load from:.." will probably quit listening
when the first is sent.

UPLD.BAT & DWNLD.BAT both display complete documentation of the cabling
requirements and step-by-step instructions (half a screen) on every use.  PC
serial ports configured as DTE and a null-modem adapter are assumed. Some PC
serial port cards can be configured as DCE and then the null-modem adapter
is not required (check your serial card manual, open the box, and set the
dip-swithces or jumpers).  ATs and compatibles often have COM1: as a DB9; a
"pig-tail" DB9/DB25 adapter cable would be required to use it.

If you don't know the address of that spare DB25 on your PC, just keep
trying DWNLD  FILE  X     (for X=1,2,3 or 4) until your TEXT file comes
across.

IBM PC DOS 2.1 and some of the special compatible PC harware Mfgr.s versions
of M/S DOS will not work properly with UPLD.BAT. Apparantly some "bugs" have
been squashed in the more recent versions of DOS.  These "buggy" DOS
versions need to recieve a 2nd Ctrl-z byte before the the target file is
closed.  Also, the carriage-return byte of the CR/LF pair is not passed to
the target file.

The first problem is cured by inserting a CHR$(154) or GRPH-l byte on a line
by itself at the end of the TANDY's TEXT file (looks like -> ).  7-bit
transmission (11-26 update) truncates this to CHR$(26) or Ctrl-z.

The second problem may not be a problem, depending on what you're feeding
the file to. Some printers and word processors treat the LF alone the same
as the CR/LF pair that is expected in plain ASCII text files.

CRLF.BAS (included in this .ARC update of 11-26-87) is a "filter" program
that reads a file without any .EXT and writes a .PRN file with completed
CR/LF pairs. Whichever ONE of the two is missing, is added.  CRLF.BAS is
straight ASCII source text for compatibility with both BASICA and GWBASIC in
the IBM/compatible. It is not intended for use in the M100 series machines
and no checksum is provided.  It does include some LONG lines of "crunched"
code for better performance in the interpreted operating mode.  If you own a
compiler (I don't), you may want to compile it.

TELCOM UP apparently only sends the CRs and thus might be unusable with the
"buggy" versions of DOS and UPLD.BAT.

I suspect the inclusion of "buffers=20" (or some other number larger than
the default 2, 99 is the maximum) in your "boot" DOS disk's root directory
CONFIG.SYS file may help in avoiding overflows with longer files.

I have so far been unsuccessful (in a couple quick tries) in using UPLD.BAT
with a friend's LEADING EDGE running "LEADING EDGE" M/S DOS 3.2 and who
knows what serial card.   My PCs LIMITED 286 works very nicely with UPLD.BAT
under any of: IBM PC DOS 2.1 (with the "bugs") or (all the rest w/o the
"bugs") 3.1 or "GENERIC" M/S DOS 3.2 or 3.21.

Perhaps a lower baud rate may cure problems with other clones & DOS
versions and serial port cards.

All DOS versions prior to IBM PC DOS 3.3 will give an error message if you
attempt to reference COM3: or COM4:.  The batch files will accept reference
to 3 or 4, it's the earlier DOS that will give that error message as only 1
and 2 are supported.

Some COMPATIBLE PC special M/S DOS versions refer to the two serial ports as
COM: and AUX: and may not even include a MODE command in the DOS (use Ctrl-
Setup on a RAINBOW instead).  Modify the BATch files as appropriate.
