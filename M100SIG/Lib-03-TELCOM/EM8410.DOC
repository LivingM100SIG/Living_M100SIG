              EM8SIG 4.1
              ==========

EM8SIG 4.1 is an emergency fix in
response to CI$ removing the SNDMAL
program from the system. EM8SIG used
SNDMAL to send electronic mail. This
version has not been extensively tested
an should be considered unstable until
you actually try it for yourself. Only a
few of the more common modes have been
tested.

Version 4.0 still works for forum-only
functions accessed through the F5 and F6
quick-start keys.

Version 4.1 still depends on electronic
mail facilities that CI$ may terminate
without notice. Please report any
problems to me. Please be _specific_
about your configuration, what you were
doing at the time. I don't want to play
20-Questions trying to figure out what
went wrong.

The version 4.0 documentation still
applies.

CHANGE: When composing email through the
F7 (Compose) function or through TEXT,
you must press the ENTER key about every
two-three screen lines. If you don't
then the program will start beeping at
you when trying to send email. Remember
that the bailout procedure is:

Ctrl-Break
GOTO 500
^C
off

The Control-C in the procedure leaves
you at a CI$ prompt. You can logoff at
this point or continue the session
manually. Since this version is
considered to be unstable, remember this
procedure. Also, the unattended mode of
operation is not recommended. If the
program or system hangs, you could be
left online for a long (costly) time.

READ THIS: Don't forget to configure the
program with your favorite options. Pay
special attention to the _Name_
variable. You must reload the program
from scratch. *Backup* the files in your
machine. Remove all (or at least all of
the big) files. Enter Basic, and
assuming the program file name is
EM8410.DO, follow the following
procedure (same as in the manual):

MAXFILES=1
CLEAR 256
LOAD "EM8410"
KILL "EM8410.DO"
SAVE "EM8SIG"

Now run EM8SIG and configure your
options.
