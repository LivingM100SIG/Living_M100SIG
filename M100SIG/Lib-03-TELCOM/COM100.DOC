 Ok Gang, you wanted it, here it is!
 The smallest, most limited Model 100 to Model 100 communications program
available. All it allows you to do is type back and forth between 2 M100's.
The big advantage of this one is that it adds linefeeds and carriage returns
where it's supposed to.

  To Run:

 The RLC file associated with this documentation was generated by
RLCLDR.BA in DL4. In order to use it, you must download that program to be
able to decode the file. Follow the directions in RLCLDR.DOC. This will
allow you to relocate the program anywhere you desire.

 Once relocated, select the program from the main menu. You'll be asked to
either type an [M] for the menu or hit any key to continue. If you opt for the
latter, you will then be in terminal mode at 9600 baud.

 Important:
 To exit from the program, use a ^A to get back to the menu prompt. [CTRL] +
[A] depressed at the same time.

 I have included the source for this program (SRC) because it is very
rudimentary and I have used most of the routines and calls necessary to write
almost any type of communications program. Where possible I have used the
same label names that appear in the M100 Technical Reference Manual.

 If you have any questions or need other baud rates, let me know; I'd be happy
to change the program for you.

             Have fun,
