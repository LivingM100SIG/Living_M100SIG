


            NOTE: The search for the name and ID is -case specific-. That
            means you must enter the name exactly the way it is in your PIN
            file for EM8SIG.400 to find it. GEORGE is not the same as George
            or george. If you do not do this you will get an error 81
            message. If you do, simply press F8 and start the procedure all
            over again.


            When the program finds your choice, you will next see "Sb:" on
        the screen beneath the "To:". Enter whatever you wish for a title for
        your message. Notice the "]". This is the guide that tells you how
        long your title can be. Anything beyond that point will be ignored.
        Press <ENTER> again and type your message. Remember not to use <CR>'s
        within the message except to end or separate paragraphs. When you
        finish, press <ENTER> three (3) times and the compose routine will
        terminate. You will again find yourself at the "COMPOSE MESSAGES"
        screen, page 21.

            To send a second letter in the same transmission go through the
        above routine again only this time answer the question, "Add to
        existing messages?", with "Y" for "YES".

            When you have finished with letter writing, either press "P" to
        exit the routine, or "F" to enter the Forum Message Routine.


                            FORUM MESSAGE COMPOSE ROUTINE

            When you review the downloaded messages, either to you, or those
        you were interested in, we will assume you wish to respond or put in
        your two-cents-worth in an ongoing discussion. Also, you have a
        question for the Forum members in general.

            From the COMPOSE MESSAGE screen, press "F". The screen will clear
        and you will see the question, "REply # or COMPose?"

        REPLIES: - - -

            To reply to a specific message enter "REn" where "n" is the
        number of the message you to which you are replying. (without the
        quotes of course.) The screen will clear again and you will see your
        entry in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Now type your
        reply. Your message will be entered into the file OUTSIG.DO. If the
        file does not exist, EM8SIG.400 will create it. Remember, no <CR>'s
        within the message except to end or separate paragraphs. When your
        message is finished press <ENTER> two (2) times. You will now see the
        word "POST". If you are replying to a message, simply press <CR>
        again. The screen will clear and you will be returned to the COMPOSE
        MESSAGE screen, page 21. If you later check the file OUTSIG.DO you
        will notice that EM8SIG has entered a /EXIT and the word POST at the
        end of your message.

        COMPOSE: - - -

            To compose your own message enter "COMP", again without the
        quotes. The screen will clear and you will see the word "To:" in the
        upper left corner of your screen followed by 23 spaces and a square
        bracket "]". The name and ID of the person you are writing to should
        already be in your PIN file. To cause EM8SIG to search for, and
        properly list the adressee's name AND ID, you must enter the code
        word of no more than six letters which you assigned to the person's
        name and ID in the ADRS.DO file. Then press <ENTER>. The program will
        look up the name and ID and enter it into the message file OUTSIG.DO.
        If the file does not already exist, EM8SIG will create it.

            REMEMBER: TO HAVE EM8SIG PROPERLY INSERT THE NAME -=AND=- THE ID
            YOU -=MUST=- USE THE CODE WORD. IF YOU ONLY ENTER THE PERSON'S
            NAME, THEN ALL EM8SIG.400 WILL PRINT IS WHAT YOU HAVE ENTERED. IF
            THE -=ID=- IS NOT PRESENT THE ADRESSEE WILL NOT RECIEVE THE
            "MESSAGE WAITING" NOTICE AND WILL NOT SEE THE MESSAGE.

            After you have entered the code word and pressed <ENTER> the
        screen will show you "Sb:" followed by 23 spaces and the "]". This is
        the guide that tells you how long your title can be. Anything beyond
        that point will be ignored. Press <ENTER> again.

            If you have set up the following lines in the PIN file:

                  ]ALL
                  ]SYSOP

        and you wish to send a message to either "ALL" or to one of the
        "SYSOP"'s, simply enter that as your name prompt in the "To:" field.

            Now type in your message. Compuserve forums have a maximum
        message length of approximately 2,200 characters. This works out to
        roughly 30 lines or 350 words. As you approach this limit EM8SIG.400
        will beep and give you a warning, "CIS MSG LIMIT. NNN SPACES LEFT"
        where NNN is the total number of spaces you have left to stay within
        the limitation. You should immediately end your message at this
        point. If you have more to say, write "MORE" and end the message.
        Then write a second message beginning with the word "CONTINUED". To
        end your message use three (3) <CR>'s. EM8SIG will prompt you with
        <POST SEC:n Options>? If you do not wish to use any options, simply
        input the number of the section that most closely approximates the
        general idea of your message like this, type "SEC:n".

            Any "Post Action" is acceptable by EM8SIG. However, since we are
        talking about automated message sending, the two "Action"'s we are
        most concerned with are PRIvate and UNFormatted. If you wish to send
        a private message in section 1, you would input, "SEC:1 PRI",
        without the quotes of course. If you wished to send a message to
        section 4 unformatted you would input, "SEC:4 UNF", again without
        the quotes. Please note that private message are NOT enabled on the
        M100SIG forum.

            To obtain the current Section/Subtopic names and numbers for
        whatever forum you are in use the "OPT" command at the first "Forum!"
        prompt after entering the forum. This will need to be done in the
        manual mode, not in the EM8SIG mode. [When in doubt, use either
        section 1 or section 0 to send a Forum message.]

                            LAST CHECK BEFORE TRANMISSION

            I like to do one last check before requesting EM8SIG.400 to
        transmit my newly written messages. If you are confident with your
        typing ability and/or spelling you can omit this step.



            If you are through writing messages, get out of EM8SIG by
        pressing F8. Remember, sometimes you will have to use F8 and <ENTER>.
        You will see one or two files on your main menu depending on what you
        have done in the way of writing messages. MAIL.DO is the file for
        outgoing EMAIL messages, and OUTSIG.DO is the file for outgoing forum
        messages. Enter the file by placing the curser over it and pressing
        <ENTER>. You are now in the standard M100/102 Text Editor. You will
        note that EM8SIG.400 has neatly separated your messages if there is
        more than one with a <graph><f> symbol. It has also ended them with
        the required /EXIT. Each message contains a line which states who the
        message is directed to, the name of the message, and post
        instructions. This was all done automatically based on information
        you gave EM8SIG. You can now correct any spelling, punctuation, etc.
        to satisfy yourself. Be careful not to edit or change any of the
        automatic settings.

                                    FINAL LOG-ON

            We are now ready to transmit our messages which have been written
        off line. Enter EM8SIG.400 as before. You should probably run through
        the "Option Menus" at least as far as the "Auto Forum (Sig) Option
        Menu" to be sure that EM8SIG is being directed to the right forum. If
        you have only Email messages to transmit, press F1. If you have both
        Email and Forum messages, press F3. If you only have Forum messages,
        press F6. Once again, sit back and enjoy the show as EM8SIG.400 logs-
        on, goes to the proper location(s), transmits your messages, and then
        logs-off. As with CMDSIG.DO, EM8SIG will replace your messages in
        each file with "Sent ". You must manually delete this word if you
        susquently wish to sent more messages.


                                      CISUSE.DO


            The CISUSE.DO file can be used as a log of -all- CIS accesses and
        can serve as an index to incoming messages SAVED in the PER file
        area. (See item 5, EasyPlex Email Option Menu, page 6.)

            As well as being used to verify CIS billings, this file can be
        the basis of your client billings. It shows separately Email and
        Forum usages.

            It can $how the advantage$ of combining your CI$ u$age$. You $ave
        $$$$$ by logging on for one long $e$$ion, in$tead of $everal $hort
        one$.

            CISUSE.DO is another file automatically established by EM8SIG.
