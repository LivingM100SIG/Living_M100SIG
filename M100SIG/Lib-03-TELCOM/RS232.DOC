The M100 CTS(5) and DSR(6) pins can be
checked from BASIC for hardware
handshaking during RS-232 (COM:) data
output from the Model 100 to another
device by testing the value returned
by the IMP(187) function.
	
When CTS is low at the 100, A% in the
expression  A%=INP(187) will be either
242 dec or 243 dec; when CTS is high,
it will be either 226 dec or 227 dec.
For DSR the values are 242 or 243 low
and 210 or 211 high.
	
A sample routine to print the string
S$ (with COM:xxxxx open on channel 1)
by testing CTS is:
	
	100 FOR I%=1 TO LEN(S$)
	110 IF INP(187) AND 16 THEN 110
	120 PRINT#1,MID$(S$,I%,1);
	130 NEXT
	140 PRINT#1," "
	150 RETURN
	
Summary:
        IF INP(187) AND 16 = false (=0)
                then CTS is high
        IF INP(187) AND 16 is true(=16)
                then CTS is low
	
        DSR is similar (Test AND 32).
	
This routine works well for connecting
the Model 100 to a Brother EP22 battery
portable typewriter using 300 baud and
sending lines no longer than 75
characters to the Brother EP22.
	
The character-by-character transmission
is for safety since INP(187) is only
checked before each print statement.
No doubt some devices will be able to
accept multi-character strings without
problems.
	
RS-232 connections for Brother EP22:
	
        M100 CTS(5) to DTR(20) Brother
        M100  TD(2) to  RD(3)  Brother
        M100  SG(7) to  SG(7)  Brother
	
Other devices should be similar.
