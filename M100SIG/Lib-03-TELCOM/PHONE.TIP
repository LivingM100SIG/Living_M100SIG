           **  M100/Phone Use Tips  **          by Gary Van Balen [71500,611]                  September 1990Here's a tip or two for making connecting your M100 to thephone system easier.MODIFICATIONS TO THE DIRECT CONNECT CABLE (26-1410)The direct (phone) connect cable Radio Shack provides forthe M100's consists of a special 8-pin DIN plug with two4ft-long, 4-conductor line cords sticking out of it.  Eachof the line cords is terminated with RJ11/14 modular plugs.One of the line cords is almond colored and is meant to beplugged into an RJ11/14 jack on the wall (line).  The otherline cord is silver and is meant to be plugged into thephone you unplugged from the wall so you could plug in thealmond colored one.  This setup gives you use of the phoneset while your not "online" with the computer.  If you wantto unplug the DIN plug from the M100, you can leave the restplugged in and complete the circuit for the phone set byplugging the DIN plug into the mating DIN jack Radio Shackhung on to one of the line cords.  In a word, the whole messis "functional".There are three things I don't like about the direct connectcable as it comes from Radio Shack:  1) The 4ft length isoften too short, 2) I rarely use the silver wire so itusually just gets in the way, and 3) The silver wire makesit difficult to coil the cable neatly so it fits in thezippered pouch of the blue M100 bag I pack everything into.Well, here's how I made my direct connect cable better.I've modified my direct connect cable by cutting the silverwire (the one meant to plug into a phone set) near the DINplug so it's only about 6" long.  I attached a RJ11/14modular plug to both cut ends of the silver wire using RSplugs (279-384) and crimping tool (279-388).  I also got aRadio Shack Inline Coupler (279-358) so I can either couplethe silver wire back together if I ever need to plug a phonein, or I can couple the 3.5ft silver 'extension' to thealmond line cord when I need a longer cable.  Just to makesure it's clear... What you end up with by doing thismodification is a direct connect cable where the silver'phone' line only sticks out 6" from the DIN plug, and youalso get a short 3.5ft long silver modular extension cordwhich can be coupled to the 'line' cord for extra length.After making this modification you'll have additionalflexibility, but won't have to carry any more than you werebefore (except two RJ11/14 plugs and an Inline Coupler ifyou're picky).  If you have to buy all of the Radio Shackparts mentioned above, the total cost will be about $12 andyou'll have 8 RJ11/14 plugs and the crimping tool for otherprojects.PHONE CONNECTION KITI hate when I want to "go online" but I can't because Ican't plug my M102 into the phone system.  Like others, I'veminimized the frequency with which this happens by carryinga "phone connection kit" consisting of all the thingsnecessary to over come the obstacles one runs into.  Otherfiles here in the M100SIG tell you the mechanics of usingthe hardware in the kit, so I'm just going to tell you whatI carry.  This is because I only recently got my M102 (used)and may have put together a kit which takes up less spacethan other similar kits - I refuse to let my M102 get anybigger than the blue padded bag it came in.  Here's what Icarry and a Radio Shack part number unless otherwise noted:Direct Connect Cable (26-1410) - modified as explained above3.5ft-long Modular Extension - from modified Direct ConnectCableInline Coupler (279-358)Duplex Jack (279-357) - can be used as an Inline Coupler too12" Modular-to-Spade cord (279-391) - this I modified bycutting off the Spade connectors and soldering on smallAlligator Clips (270-378)Telephone - I carry a small phone with me.  It's only 7.5"long, 1.3" wide, and 0.9" high.  It has redial, tone andpulse dialing, and weighs 4oz.  It only cost $10 from theWarehouse Club.  It's called a "micro PHONE" made byBrights.  It's also fluorescent pink and black - yuck!  It'sfun to pull this out and pretend you're talking on it whenon a plane next to someone with a "real laptop".Small flathead and Phillips screwdrivers - any will doAcoustic Coupler (26-3818) - only added to kit when I knowI'll be restricted to using a public pay phoneEverything mentioned above, except the acoustic coupler fitsinto the zippered pouch (along with the AC adapter) insidemy blue padded M100 bag.  I have not been prevented fromgoing online since I've been carrying the above kit.Happy computing!
