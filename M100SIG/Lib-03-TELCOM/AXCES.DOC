AXCES.DOC - Documentation for AXCES.TTT   (2/24/84)

AXCES.TTT is a code which searches the user's ADRS.DO file for alternate 
Compuserve phone numbers, displays the numbers for user selection, and rebuilds 
the 'cisp' entry in the ADRS.DO file to incorporate the selected number.  The 
code also permits automatic execution of another program on completion.

The code initially selects the user's phone and access number from an entry in 
the user's ADRS.DO file identified as 'cisp'.  A typical 'cisp' entry is:

  cisp:phone<=^C?Iidnumber^M?Ppassword^M?!PRO^M?K>:

    The 'phone', 'idnumber', and 'password' are configured to contain the user's
information.  The 'PRO' entry is used to access the programming area by other 
codes.

The 'cisp' phone number (but only the phone number) is displayed for the user, 
who then is given two choices: use this number, or select an alternate number.  
If selection of an alternate number is chosen, AXCES searches the user's ADRS.DO
file for alternate numbers identified as 'CSIS', such as:

    CSIS   San Francisco,CA :9564191:

Both the city designation and the number are displayed for the user's choice.  
When an acceptable alternate is selected, AXCES rebuilds the ADRS.DO file to 
include the choice in the 'cisp' entry.

When the initial number is selected, or an alternate choice is included in 
ADRS.DO, AXCES allows the user to go directly to the execution of another code, 
or (for no entry), to the MENU.     AXCES.TTT is utilized by other codes: 
GMAIL3.TTT, FILGET.TTT, FILCOP.TTT, and GETSIG.TTT).  Documentation for these 
codes is contained in GMAIL3.DOC, FILGET.DOC, FILCOP.DOC, and GETSIG.DOC.
