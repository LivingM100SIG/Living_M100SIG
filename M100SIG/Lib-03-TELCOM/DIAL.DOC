Dial.BA is a program for the Model 100 that searches the ADRS.Do file for a
given string and logs the record and time in minutes spent on the phone.  This
is useful when trying to reconcile your phone calls against the phone Co's
bill.  I use this to create a list for expense purposes.
The only requirement of operation is that the phone no. be the last item in a
record and must be surrounded by colons (:)  
Operation: 
(Assuming you are using the standard Radio Shack modem connector or equiv.)
1.  The program prompts you with>  Search:
2.  Enter the string to search for and press ENTER (note that Upper/Lower case
is required to find a match)
3.  If you press ENTER or F8 or type Menu you will exit the program.
4.  When it finds a record that matches the string you will be given the
opportunity to Dial the phone by pressing ENTER or if you hit any other key it
will continue the search.
5.  By pressing ENTER you will start the dialing process.
6.  Pick up the phone at this point.  (you will not hear a dial tone) 
7.  The M100 will not release the phone until it is finished dialing then you
will be connected.
8.  You will now be prompted to Hit ENTER to log out or to press ESCape to exit
without making an entry.  Pressing ENTER will disconnect the phone for you (if
you have not done so manually) and enter the record that you called along with
the start time and total minutes into the PHONE.do file.
