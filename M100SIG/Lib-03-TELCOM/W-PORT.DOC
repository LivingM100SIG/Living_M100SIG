          Software For The M100/T102 And The WorldPort External Modem

      Q-PORT = TELCOM for the WorldPort Modem (or 100% Hayes compatibles)

                X-PORT = X-TEL interface for the WorldPort Modem

  For those of you who have an external modem and find the lack of support a
real pain, here are two programs that will make your life a lot easier.

  The first program (Q) is a bread-and-butter auto-dialer - redialer -
auto-logon program that will jump to TELCOM as soon as the logon sequence is
complete.

  The second, (X) is an interface to X-TEL V2.1 and V2.2 which does the same
functions but with different procedures tailored to the way X-TEL works.

                           ---->VERY IMPORTANT!<----

          Before attempting to run X-PORT, PLEASE read the section on
          them!  I do not check to see if X-TEL has been relocated.
          If you run a relocated version of X-TEL with X-PORT, THE
          PROGRAM WILL BOMB.  Change the variable "D" in line 2 to
          indicate the TOP (or HIMEM) address of your version of
          X-TEL.  Also, the program assumes that you use the standard
          basic loader that is supplied with X-TEL (X-TEL.BA).  If
          you do not use that program name for your loader, change
          line 4 to reflect the new name that you have given the
          loader program.

  Both programs use the ADRS.DO file to store phone numbers and auto-logon
strings.  The ADRS file can be in RAM or on the Chipmunk, DVI, or Tandy Disk
Drive (if an alternate operating system is installed); the program will find it
wherever it is.  If you already have your ADRS file set up, fine, you are ready
to start using the program.  If not, create one using the procedures listed in
the M100 User Manual, pages 89-92.  These programs use EXACTLY the same syntax
as the TELCOM program in the M100/T102 with one exception: you cannot have any
characters past the [ > ] in the auto logon string.

                    ----------------------------------------
                              Running the Program
                    ----------------------------------------

                          Commands at (Find:) prompt:

                   [CR]........Find first/next phone number.
                   [ESC].......Go back to (Find:) prompt.   
                   [BKSP]......Go to top of program.        
                   [F8]........Menu or X-TEL.               
                   [DIAL]......Go to TELCOM for manual dial.
                   [any key]...Dial last number listed.     

  Anything that is inside of brackets - [] - is to be typed in.  Do not type
the brackets

                            Specifics for Q-PORT.100
                            ------------------------

  To run the program, make sure you have a copy of your ADRS file in RAM or on
disk (for the TDD, you must have a DOS that supports BASIC to access from
disk).

  Upon entering the program, you will be able to make three decisions:

1) Each time you depress [1], you will toggle the baud rate between 1200, 300,
   2400 baud, and the internal modem.

2) Select Setup Menu by depressing [2]. (see the section on this)

3) If you depress any other key, you should see the Find: prompt.  At this time
   the above commands become active.  You can now type in the string you wish
   to search for.  The program is designed to keep keystrokes to a minimum, so
   if you have your primary logon string as the first number in your ADRS file,
   all you should have to do is hit [CR] and then any other key to start the
   autodial process.  If you have the wrong number up on the screen, you can
   hit the [ESC] key to get the find prompt back, or keep hitting [CR] to cycle
   through the ADRS file.  If you hit the [BKSP] key, you will return to the
   top of the program to allow selection of a different baud rate or go to the
   Setup Menu.  Once you have found the number you wish to call and hit a key,
   the rest of the process is automatic.

  If not using the internal modem, the program will check for or use the
following Hayes commands:

                         ATZ              ATDT        
                         ATDP             ATB0        
                         ATB1             ATX1        
                         ATX4             A/          
                         CONNECT          CONNECT 1200
                         NO CARRIER       BUSY        
                         NO DIALTONE                  

  There are 6 S-registers that are supported, but are not necessary for normal
operation. (see Setup Menu)

  If, while the program is redialing, you wish to go back to try another
number, (Find:) hit any key.  If the program doesn't respond immediately, be
patient, it might take one more redial to recognize your keystroke.  With the
internal modem, you may go back after the first time number is dialed as well
as after redials.

                             ---------------------
                             Screen Scroll Disable
                             ---------------------

  As you entered the program, you might have noticed the two function key
definitions.  (F6 & F7)  The M100/T102 screen has a problem with 1200 baud
operation in that it will not scroll the screen at any thing over 600 baud.
This takes away the advantage of high speed operation on services such as
CompuServe that charge extra for 1200 baud.  But you can "beat the system" by
turning off the screen scroll during downloads.  The M100 will then receive at
any baud rate.  The only trade-off is that you will have to read what you have
downloaded afterwards, offline.

  The two keys are to be used while online.  When you get to a point where you
want to download, hit the [F7] key.  At this point the screen will stop
scrolling and start printing on one line only.  You will still be able to see
prompts and do normal commands, but it will just be a bit more confusing until
you get used to it.  When finished with high speed downloads, hit the [F6] key
to return to normal operation.

                               ------------------
                               Setup Menu Options
                               ------------------
 Upon selecting the [2] option at the main screen, you will be presented with a
new screen with a list of options:

 1) STAT = Allows you to change the other parameters of your STAT setting.  Use
    if you need to change to 8 bit, stop bits, etc.

 2) Pulse/Tone = Toggles between the two methods of dialing.  Note: You cannot
    use pulse dialing with the acoustic coupler.

 3) Modem Std. = Toggles between Bell 103/212A and CCITT V.21/V22 modem
    standards.  Bell is used in the U.S. and CCITT is used internationally.
    Refer to your modem manual for full details.

                                  -----------
                                  S-Registers
                                  -----------

 There are 17 software registers that can be modified to change the operating
characteristics of the modem.  I have selected the 6 most useful of these to be
included in Q-PORT and X-PORT.

 To change a value, select the desired register then enter a new value.  An
asterisk [*] will be displayed next to a register that has a non-default value
stored in it.  If you wish to see what you have entered, select the register
and then press [CR] with no other input. The value that you previously entered
will then be displayed.  If there isn't an asterisk next to the register,
nothing will print.

 4) S6 = Wait time for dial tone.  2-255 seconds.  Default = 2 seconds.

 5) S7 = Wait time for carrier (after dialing).  1-255 seconds.  Default = 30
    seconds.

 6) S8 = Pause time (caused by comma).  0-255 seconds.  Default = 2 seconds.

 7) S9 = Carrier detect response time.  1-255 1/10 second.  Default = 6/10ths
    seconds

 8) S10 = Delay time between loss of carrier and "hang up".  1-255 1/10 second.
    Default = 7/10ths seconds.

 9) S11 = Duration and spacing of Touch-Tones.  50-255 milliseconds.  Default =
    70 milliseconds.

 10) Reset to Defaults = Allows you to clear all of the registers and set all
     other parameters back to their original values.

                            ------------------------
                            Specifics for X-PORT.100
                            ------------------------

  Due to the nature of X-TEL, it will be necessary to make a small change to
X-PORT in order to make it run with a relocated version of X-TEL.  If you just
use the standard non-relocated version, this program is ready to run and you
can skip to the section on running X-PORT.

                              -------------------
                              Modifing X-PORT.100
                              -------------------

  To modify X-PORT, first you need to find out the number that you will insert
into the program.  That number is the TOP address of X-TEL.  To find it, you
can go into basic and type [LOADM"X-TEL].  Three numbers will print out, the
first of which is the TOP address that you are looking for.

  Another method would be to go into X-TEL, set your STAT for 57I1E, press
[F4], press and hold the [CODE & SHIFT] while pressing [F7].  This will get you
into X-TEL basic.  At this point, type [KEY LIST].  This will list the function
key definitions.  The definition for key 8 will be a CALL nnnnn.  That is the
number you will want to write down for X-PORT modification.

  After you get the number, go into basic, load X-PORT.DO, and enter [EDIT2].
You can then edit the number that is associated with the variable "D".  After
finishing, save the program.

                               ------------------
                               Running X-PORT.100
                               ------------------

  Since you need to access X-PORT while online, I have found that there are
several ways to load and run the program depending on how many keystrokes you
can tolerate.  I will assume in the following discussion that you have set
function key 7 to: RUN"X-PORT" 

Below is a line that can be merged into X-PORT to set function key 7.

3 KEY7,"Run " + CHR$(34) + CHR$(88) + CHR$(45) + CHR$(80) + CHR$(79) + CHR$(82)
+ CHR$(84) + CHR$(34) + CHR$(13)

  Run X-PORT from the main menu.  It will look for the loader program
(X-TEL.BA) and excecute it.  Once inside X-TEL, at the Telcom: prompt, press
[F4] (Term).  Next, go into X-TEL basic by pressing and holding [CODE + SHIFT]
while hitting the [F7] key.  Press the [F7] key again to excecute X-PORT again.
This time you will see the X-PORT menu.  The menu should be self explainitory.
When you select option 1 or 2, the program will toggle and update the screen
with the new status.  Once you press [CR], the program will start working
exactly like Q-PORT.  The only exception is the method for disabling and
enabling screen scroll.  You have to go back into X-TEL basic every time you
want to toggle that option.

                    ----------------------------------------

  First I'd like to thank Rich Young, Rick Perry, Joel Dinda and Dan Drasin for
various parts of the program and Bill Templeton for excellent beta testing.
But mostly I'd like to thank Leonard Erickson whose fine bit of detective work
in finding the entry point for the Telcom auto-logon routine really made the
program possible.
