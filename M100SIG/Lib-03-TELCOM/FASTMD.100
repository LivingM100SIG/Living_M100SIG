Hackers:
A recent message on the SIG about speeding up the internal modem prompted me to
hack up the following program. It allows TELCOM to run at 450 baud (a 50% speed
up!) on some CompuServe numbers.  TYMNET/TELENET don't support this higher
rate. Let me make my apologies up front;  before running it you MUST CLEAR
256,MAXRAM.  It also destroys the F6 function key assignment in TELCOM if
you've got one.  If you can deal with that, this little feller does work.

There are more elegant ways to accomplish it, but.....just RUN this program,
then enter TELCOM and dial the CIS number WITHOUT a logon macro (i.e. with "<>"
after the number). After you get the connect (label line changes) and BEFORE
typing anything, press F6.  You then are in 450 baud mode....enjoy!

For a version which works with a Tandy 200, see the file FASTMD.200 in Library
10.
