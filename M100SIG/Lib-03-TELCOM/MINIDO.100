                     Mininet v.2.1 and 2.1X Documentation
(Mininet v. 1.03 and documentation Copyright 1983 David J. Ulmer. Revisions and
updates Copyright 1986 Tom Fitzpatrick.) "This program may be copied,

  Mininet 2.1 is a bulletin board program designed for use on a Model 100
computer with 24K or more of RAM. A 32K machine can comfortably hold thirty
accounts, leaving 21K for messages. For automatic answering, Mininet 2.1
requires the telephone ring detector described in the files TELECO.DO and
SCHEM.REV, both on DL8. For those not electronically inclined, a few
modifications convert Mininet 2.1 to Mininet 2.1X, which allows Mininet to work
with an external auto answer modem instead.
  Two files are needed to get Mininet 2.1 up and running. This file requires
8105 bytes, MINVC2.100 8420. Once these files are obtained, please save them
as-is before making any modifications (just in case a mistake is made and you
need to refer to the original).
  To set up Mininet, clear your 100 of all other programs and load Mininet 2.1
as a BASIC program. Next, create files I.DO, M.DO, ADRS.DO, M 4.DO and M 5.DO
(That's M(space)4.DO and M(space)5.DO--don't forget the space!) using figures
1-5 as examples. If you are using the built-in modem, at this point you should
connect the ring detector and the phone line and switch the ANS/ORIG switch on
the 100 to ANS. If you are using an external modem, connect the modem to the
100 via the RS-232 port and follow the directions for converting Mininet 2.1 to
Mininet 2.1X.
  Now you can RUN Mininet(finally!). The screen will clear, then display the
time and number of bytes free. Press [F1], then the LABEL key, then [F4]. You
should now see the re-defined function keys. Those keys are: 
  [F1] Quit - Stops Mininet and resets the function keys.
  [F4] Run - Acts as if your 100 is calling itself.
  [F5] Ring - Tells Mininet to answer the phone as if it were ringing.

Try [F4] now. You will hear a beep and see a flashing block on the screen.
Press ENTER. (ENTER is referred to as <cr> in the program.) Your 100 will
respond by printing the version of the program, then "Enter I.D. or NEW:." Log
onto the system by typing your user number and password here. Notice that the
function keys have again changed. They now read:
  [F1] Chat - Allows direct typing between you and a caller.
  [F2] View - Toggles the screen on and off. The screen is usually left off for
increased speed.
  [F3] ^X and [F4] Zoom (^X) - The 100 running Mininet will not recognize a
CTRL-X or a CTRL-Z from its keyboard. Use [F3] and [F4] instead. 
  [F5]-[F7] - Shows name of current caller(if the label line is on).
  [F8] ^S - Displays a ^S only when one computer asks the other to wait.

  Maintenance on Mininet should be done every two or fewer days. This
maintenance involves printing or deleting the userlog(L.DO), changing printer
paper(if used), and deleting email that has already been read. The userlog
(L.DO) will contain the name, logon/logoff dates and times of callers, any
information left from a NEW user or from an established one using FEEDBACK, and
any program errors. If a ready printer is attached to the parallel port, this
information will be printed; otherwise, it is entered into L.DO.
  Email are entries in the file named M 4.DO To delete email, go into M 4.DO
and Find ([F1]) \D. (To get the \, hold down the GRPH key while pressing the -
key.) This will signal the start of a piece of mail that has already been read.
Press [F7] (SELect), then Find [F1] \ (that's "\" and a space). Now press [F6],
Cut. Repeat this procedure until you are at the end of the file. It sounds
complicated, but gets much easier with practice!
  You are now at the controls of your own bulletin board system(BBS). If you
have any questions or comments, please send them via U.S. mail to:

My "Starving college student" financial status prohibits me from answering with
Compuserve mail, but I will reply to all inquiries sent to the above address.
A self-addressed, stamped envelope is appreciated. Good Luck!

Notes:  ^[ is the ESCape key.  Enter it into the file by holding down the CTRL
key while pressing p, then pressing ESC.  Whenever Mininet sees this, it stops
and waits for input.  ^Q is similar--hold down CTRL while pressing p, then hold
down CTRL and press q.  This ends the file.

The format for a user is:

NUMBER(different for each user)PASSWORD(ALL UPPER CASE),Name(UPPER/lower
case),last call date and time(start out with 00/00/0000:00)

Notes: Use a unique number for each user. The passwords must be in all UPPER
case, and do not need to be unique. Placing an "*" in one's name gives him
sysop access, meaning he can delete any file, read all email(not just his
own--do this by typing 4+++), and he can respond to the Help/Recent news
column. Be sure to give yourself this access!

MININET HELP FILE
  Mininet operates using numeric commands. These commands are:
  1. GOODBYE: Disconnects you from the board. You may write feedback to the
system operator as you leave.
  2. ENTER A MESSAGE: Eleven message subjects can be maintained by Mininet at
the same time. If there is room, this will allow you to start a new message
subject.
  3. DELETE A MESSAGE: Deletes a message that you wrote. Because of the
limited memory here, you will want to become very familiar with this command!
  4. EMAIL READ/SEND: This first reads any mail to you, then asks if you would
like to send some. To send mail, type in the recipient's name exactly as it
appears on the board, including an "*" if one appears at the end of his name.
  5++ HELP/SYSTEM NEWS: Types this file. Additional news will occasionally be 
added to the end of this file. To read just the new news without the help 
file, type 5 instead of 5++.
  # Reads the new responses to that message(i.e. entering 6 reads the new 
responses to message 6, if there are any.)
  #++ Reads all of message #. 
  CTRL-S Pauses the screen. Any key re-starts.
  CTRL-N Skip to next response in a message, or to next piece of mail.
  CTRL-Z ZOOM! Quick disconnect.
  X-ON/X-OFF: Please ENABLE this feature on your terminal to prevent lost
characters.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: When using CTRL-S to pause the display, please note that you
only have 1.5 minutes to re-start before the board logs you off automatically!
  That about does it. Any questions? If so, leave a public message and one of 
us should be able to help you out! THE MANAGEMENT

Because of memory restrictions, the 
help file has not been repeated here.  
Please refer to your help sheet.

FIGURE 5b. (M 5.DO)
Notes:  I suggest that 5a. be sent on paper to each user, and 5b. be put in
file M 5.DO. The reason is obvious--the help file takes up over 1700 bytes by
itself.
