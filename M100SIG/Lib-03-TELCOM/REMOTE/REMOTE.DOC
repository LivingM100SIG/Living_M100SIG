                              REMOTE

    Remote is a collection of programs and batchfiles that allow you to 
control your PC remotely from your Tandy Model 100, 102 or 200, or for that 
matter, from any terminal having a modem and telecommunications software, 
using the DOS CTTY command. It is perfect for transferring material between 
your PC and your portable.

    The CTTY command redirects the DOS standard input and output to devices 
other than the keyboard and screen. Remote directs input and output to the 
modem attached to your PC.

    Remote is called by a batchfile called OFF.BAT (for reasons that will 
become apparent later).
    
    To transfer control to your M100, M102 or M200 portable,

    Connect the pink line from your portable's direct-connect cable to the 
modem.

    Select TELCOM from your portable's menu.

    On your PC, type OFF (enter) from the DOS prompt.

    You'll be given the option of pressing a key to continue, or of pressing 
Control-C to abort.
    
    If you press a key to continue, your PC's modem will sound a tone.

    Press the F4 key on your portable for Term mode. The modems shake hands, 
and you'll see the DOS prompt on your portable's screen.

    From this point, all the DOS commands are available to you from your 
portable, as though you were sitting at your PC keyboard.

    To end the session, type OFF. This returns control to your PC's keyboard 
and screen. If you hangup your portable without first typing off, you'll have 
to do a warm boot to regain control of your PC.

    Besides the basic REMOTE and OFF programs, I've included a couple of other 
routines that make life easier when transferring files between your portable 
and your PC.

    To upload files from your portable to your PC, from the DOS prompt on your 
portable type UPL (filespec) (enter), and upload as usual using the portable's 
F3 key.

    To download files from your PC to your portable, type DOW (filespec) 
(enter), begin capturing using the F2 key on your portable, and then hit 
(enter) to begin the dowload.
 
    The programs in this archive file are:
    REMOTE.EXE: Opens a channel to your modem and, using the Hayes command 
ATA, forces it to give a tone. Used by OFF.BAT.
    RFILTER.EXE: Reads characters from the modem and writes them to a disk 
file on your PC using DOS I/O redirection. Used by UPL.BAT.
    OFF.BAT: The main batchfile, which runs in a loop between CTTY CON 
(control by the keyboard and screen) and CTTY COM1 (control via modem).
    UPL.BAT: A batchfile that performs some housekeeping and calls RFILTER.EXE 
for uploading from your portable to your PC.
    DOW.BAT: A batchfile that performs some housekeeping and uses the TYPE 
internal DOS command to send a file from your PC to your portable.
    For the program to work, you must also have MODE.COM from your DOS disk in 
your current path.

    The batchfiles can be modified to meet your needs. In OFF.BAT, the 
parameters after REMOTE set the communications parameters, which if no 
parameters are given default to COM1:, 300 baud, Even parity, 7-bit word, 1 
stop bit. Add parameters, and REMOTE will use them instead of the defaults. 
However, the defaults work beautifully with the Tandy portables.
    The RFILTER defaults may be overridden in an identical fashion.

    The formats:

    REMOTE [port speed parity bits stop-bit]

    RFILTER >/>> filespec [port speed parity bits stop-bit] 

    UPL filespec

    DOW filespec

    Or, you can modify the source code REMOTE.PAS and RFILTER.PAS and 
recompile using Turbo Pascal 4.0 and up. Note these two files use the 
ASYNC.PAS package of asynchronous communications routines, which may be 
downloaded from the Borland Pascal forum and, probably, elsewhere.

    People using the PCjr or any other PC lacking DMA must upload to a RAM 
disk to avoid lost characters, since REMOTE lacks any sort of protocol.

    Enjoy!
