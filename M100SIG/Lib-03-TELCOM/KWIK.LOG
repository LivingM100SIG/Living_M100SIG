KWIK.LOG

Two "Rapid Logon Techniques" are described in this captured message thread.
Ways to log on quickly to your most frequently used access number, whether
it's CompuServe or your favorite BBS. The first can be used with 100/102
or 200, a ROM CALL makes the second specific to the Model 100/102.

It's a simple thing but I think it's kinda neat. Until recently I would log on
to Compuserve by typing CIS or ci at the TELCOM (F1) "Find" prompt.  It was
quick and easy, but I discovered that by having the auto-log on sequence at
the very beginning of the ADRS file it is even quicker.  (No blank line at the
top. )  Now after selecting TELCOM it's just three key strokes: <F1> <ENTER>
<F2>. This is not mentioned in any of the books I have on the subject so I
thought that some of you may not be aware of this.

Perhaps even quicker - for Model 100/102 users:  Put your most frequently used
access phone number and logon/password string in the ADRS.DO file as the first
line.  Then create and save a one-line BASIC program - call it "CIS.BA".  The
program will consist of only one CALL, in the form:

1 CALL 21067

(You can remove the space between "CALL" and the number, it's there only for
clarity.)  To call CIS, move the cursor over CIS.BA on the main menu and press
the ENTER key twice.  The CALL will find the first ADRS entry and dial it
automatically, then drop you into TELCOM when CIS connects.

I now have on my M100's main menu your 12 byte CIS.BA one-liner and it works
like a charm. Thanks, Tony

SUPERA users - for what it's worth. Here's an extra tip on KWIK.LOG: Define a
key, and after your appropriate CALL (for TELCOM) add two  GRPH e   this will
completly log you on!

I have been playing around with the KWIK logon version for the 200. I have
tried calls in the 24890 to 25020 range. Some of the calls open up Telcom, and
one (24905) lists part of my logon script for CIS. However, can't seem to do
what 21,067 does on the 100 for KWIK. Is there an equivilent call on the 200?

Well, I don't use KWIK, myself, so don't know what it shows on the screen, or
what it looks like when it's working.  One problem with 21067, which wasn't
mentioned in the previous exchanges, is that the STATus in TELCOM must already
be set correctly when you run the CIS.BA program, and that it works only with
the internal modem.  For example, if you had accessed the disk drive recently,
the status might have been left at 98N1D or something similar - depending on
what you had actually used the COM port for...  It has to be Mxxxx for it to
work. (Mxxxxxx for the 200)

The equivalent call for the 200 is 24905.  It's not a documented call in any of
the ROM maps or books, as far as I can tell, so we have no documentation on how
it _should_ work.  I have no idea of what differences there might be, if any.

I tried CALL 24905 in my 200, and it works perfectly for me.  I had to dig out
a 300 baud modem cable - and you'll never know how hard that was to find! -- 
I set up CIS.BA, set up an ADRS.DO file, moved the cursor over CIS.BA, pressed
ENTER twice, and it did it's thing, and got me into CompuServe at 300 baud, no
problem.

When you go into TELCOM, it displays the phone number and <>, but not any part
of the logon string.  If you saw part of your logon string, something was
wrong with something.  You should NEVER see any part of your logon string at
that point.

I tried dialing with both tone and pulse dial, and it worked fine with both.
So I don't know what problem you encountered with the call.  Try it again - be
patient, give it a minute to work.

As usual, Tony, you are correct. Call 24905 does put you atop your ADRS.DO
file and it is a quick and easy way to log on to CIS or your favorite BBS with
your Model 200. I tried the call several times in my experiments. I think my
Telcom status was changed by PWR-DSK, and perhaps that why the simple 11-byte
program didnt work.
