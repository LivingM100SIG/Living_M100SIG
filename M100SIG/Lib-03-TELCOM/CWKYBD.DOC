DOCUMENTATION for CWKYBD.100

This is an International Morse Code sending program which converts the Model
100 into a sending keyboard. The program uses the cassette relay to key the Morse
sender (usually a radio transmitter).
I have used the program successfully for hundreds of on-the-air contacts around
the world and am finally happy with the program in this form.

The first prompt after "run" is ZZ$= 
Here you type in a message of up to 250 letters which will be sent whenever you
press the = sign. 
The next prompt is WPM? 
Here you type in the rate at words per minute which you wish to use. (This
program seems to work adequately up to about 60 WPM.)
The next prompt is TEXT:
Now you can enter text which will be sent when you hit <ENTER> and this will
leave you in DIRECT MODE ie any letter which you type will be sent immediately.
You can re-enter TEXT delayed mode by hitting <ENTER> again. ... etc.

The buffer used is only the built in one which is a little short so you cannot
type ahead in direct mode more than about twenty letters.
