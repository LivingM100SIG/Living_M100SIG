
  This documentation complements XMD105.SRC.  It is not really
documentation, but a list of suggestions and clarifications for
the use of the source code for XMD105.

  Suggestions for improvement (not all mine, of course):

     1) The routines that directly access the RAM file structure
should be replaced with the appropriate DEV:FILNAM.EX access
routines for direct SEND/REC'V or UPLD/DWNLD to disk (or whatever)
files.

     2) Logged default device displayed with prompt.

     3) Optional auto-redial until connection.

     4) Toggle ON/OFF control of download without starting new filename
each time.  This is standard on MOST modem programs.

     5) Control-X (^X) should abort the SEND or REC'V in progress and
send a ^X to the host (or whoever) to let them know.  This logic is partly
in place but does not function correctly.

     6) When downloading (DOWN in inverse video) the XMOD screen can be
switched to, but the inverse video is transfered to the RECV display.
This may or may not be an undesired effect, depending on taste.

     7) The direct SEND/RECV of .BA, .CO, and any other idiosyncratic
files is fairly simple if you know the operating system vectors for
manipulating them.  I merely know their file structure, so my way was
fraught with peril.  Not to mention long coding, big program, etc.
Better to use the operating system.

  Well...good luck...please share...and above all...COMMUNICATE !!!
