            The above are my terminal settings and I know that this set up
        works. You don't need to set all items identical to mine.  The
        starred items are critical items.  Set them to the values listed
        above.  Here are some notes on those items:

            (1) Forum mode MUST be set to COMMAND but you can do it in each
                forum instead of here.  Setting this parameter here sets it
                for every forum you visit.  You only need to set it for the
                forums that you visit with EM8SIG.  If there is a forum that
                you visit infrequently but do it interactively then can still
                navigate with menus by setting this parameter to MENU and
                each EM8SIG forum to COMMAND.

            (2) Screen width may be set to 40 for the Model 100/102. However,
                a width of 80 will work for PCs and M100s if you use both. If
                you elect to use the "LPT:" download path and direct
                everything to your printer, you will most definitely want the
                width to be 80.

            (3) This is not strictly required by EM8SIG but have pity on your
                fellow users!  Messages in all CAPS are hard to read and it
                looks like you are SHOUTING!

                                     APPENDIX B
                                     ******** *

                              SUGGESTED PROGRAM USAGES
                              ********* ******* ******

        1.  The program can be used as an "Email only" by using the <F1> key.

        2.  Full function auto-Email & auto-Forum operation can be obtained
            by:

            a. the <F2> key, or
            b. setting Item 6, Auto-Forum Screen to "Yes".
               If "b." then the Auto-time routine will always access the Forum
               as well as Email.

        3.  Use the <F3> key to send/receive only Email and Forum messages.
            If there are no outgoing or incoming messages, a message "check"
            can be accomplished in one-minute billing time if CIS is at full
            speed.

        4.  Use the auto-time feature to send and receive messages at
            off-peak hours when the CIS network is at its maximum speed. You
            can cut your message co$t$ by as much as one-half by selecting
            your timing.

        5.  Use Item  5, EasyPlexEMAIL Screen, to SAVE incoming messages to
            your CIS Peronal File Area for later reading.

        6.  Use the multiple addressee feature (To:Ben;Dave;70001,101;EJ<CR>
            to send copies of your messages to your friends, office, etc.
            $ave money as this feature  does not incur the ten-cent per copy
            surcharge as dcoes regular Easyplex and other auto-email
            programs. Addresses approximately three+ messages/minute.

        7.  Use the send-from-PER-area feature (To#FILE.NME:Ben;Ed;Young<CR>
            to send forms, program copies, etc. that have been uploaded by
            Xmodem to multiple/single addressees.

        8.  As posted EM8SIG.400 limits the number of addressees for 6 & 7 to
            25. We suggest that longer lists be subdivided. This limit is set
            in line 17 and can be changed by the user.

        9.  The program automatically sets the M100/102 dialing rate to 20
            pulses per second (pps). If your phone system has trouble
            accepting 20 pps. then change POKE63019,20 in line 17 to
            POKE63019,1 for 10 pps.

        10. The program automatically sets the M100/102's communication
            status to "M7I1E". This is done in lines 17 and 19.

        NOTE: ITEMS 6, 7 AND 8 HAVE BEEN COPIED VERBATIM FROM MARVIN'S
              ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION. NEITHER STAN NOR I HAVE EVER TRIED TO
              SEND MULTIPLE MESSAGES USING EM8SIG. WE DO NOT KNOW IF IT CAN
              BE DONE. IF YOU TRY THIS - AND IT WORKS - PLEASE LET US KNOW.
              MULTIPLE MESSAGES, IF WORKABLE, ONLY APPPLY TO EMAIL NOT FORUM
              MESSAGES. THANKS.



                                  SOME USEFUL HINTS
                                  **** ****** *****


        1. If a Chipmunk is turned off while the CDOS (Chipmunk DOS) is still
           residing in RAM, a NR error in line 17 will occur. Either turning
           on the Chipmunk or removing the CDOS will clear the error.

        2. Error 55, Line 52 plus ?NM ERROR IN 80 will occur if the program's
           files are configured for PSCG's RAM+ expansion RAM and its ROM+
           chip is not turned on. A similar error will occur if the program
           is configured for a Holmes' Chipmunk or a Tandy DVI and it is not
           turned on.

        3. Try writing outgoing messages in different files/banks for sending
           at different times/days. Always REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE "Sent "
           FROM THE FIRST LINE OF BOTH OUTGOING MESSAGE FILES AND THE
           COMMAND(SIG) FILE. Hint: leave the "Sent  " in the file(s) to
           accumulate outgoing messages until the night-time lower phone
           rates and higher system speeds -while- still being able to check
           frequently for incoming messages.

        4. If dialing from PBX/OFFICES/HOTELS always use the direct connect
           modem cable whenever possible. A paper clib or small screwdriver
           makes an excellent tool to release a phone plug that has had the
           plastic tip broken off.

        5. One of our users has made the following suggestion which you might
           want to try. If CIS locks up while you are on line, enter ^C to
           break out of the lock-up. Next type, "GOTO 50" rather than "GOTO
           500" as was previously stated on page 5. This results in a restart
           of the program without a disconnect according to our user. We have
           not tested this so we cannot guarantee its success.

        6. The delimiter on multiple addressee messages is a ";"; such as:
              To:Ben;Dave M;Utt;Max

        7. To send a message from your CIS PER area use this message format:
              To:#FILE.NME:Marv;Jim;PSCG;76576,2033
              The "FILE.NME" is the "to be sent" file's name as it is
              designated in your PER area.

        8. If several persons in your PIN file are given the same "Code
           Word", and that "Code Word" is used in the "To:" line it will send
           messages to multiple addressees.

        9. The auto-dialer will attempt to make contact with CIS. If no
           carrier is detected, EM8SIG.400 will disconnect, wait a few
           seconds, and try again. After 20 tries with no success, EM8SIG
           will indicate a code 82 error in line 55, post this information in
           EM8ERR.DO, and return to the Option Screen, page 4. The amount of
           tries may be adjusted by editing line 55. Change "IFZ>20" to to
           whatever number you choose. As an example, "IFZ>5".


                         HOW TO AUTO-LOG-ON WHEN USING CUPS
                         *** ** **** *** ** **** ***** ****

        To use the auto-log-on with cups:

        1. Place an entry in your auto log-on file (ADRS.DO) that has a 5 in
           place of the phone number; i.e.,

               CUPS:5<=^C?Unnnnn,nnnn^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:

        2. Set the DIR/ACP switch to ACP.

        3. Enter the program and press <CR> twice, wait until the program
           pauses at the Access Number prompt.

        4. Type in: CUP<CR> (-IF- you have used the recommended log-on
           entry.)

        5. The program will then proceed and pause at the Auto-Time prompt.

        6. Place the cups on the phone and dial the access number manually.

        7. While the number is ringing, press <CR>. The program will now
           log-on when the call is answered by a modem. (Don't worry if CIS
           answers before you can press the <CR>. Press it anyway, as long as
           there is a modem tone the program will log-on. If CIS doesn't
           answer before the program times out, then start over and wait to
           press the <CR> after CIS answers.

        8. If dialing from a PBX, office, or hotel, always use the direct
           modem cable whenever possible. Where a direct connection is
           possible, BUT the local phone system will not accept the
           M100/102's pulse dialing THEN dial the access number using the
           local phone and follow the procedures above for using "cups"
           except leave the DIR/ACP switch in the DIR position.
