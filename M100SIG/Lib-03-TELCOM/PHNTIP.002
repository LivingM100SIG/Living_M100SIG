Disabling Call Waiting
----------------------
Fm: Denny Thomas 73126,672
   If you have "Call Waiting" on your telephone line, there is a new way to
eliminate it when online to CIS.
   All that's required is a 4 digit code (1170) added to the front of your CIS
telephone number in ADRS.DO The form is: 1170-999-9999<logon info>
   This will cause a busy signal on incoming calls instead of aborting a
download or corrupting files.
   When doing transfers other than on CIS, (M100<--->M100,etc) use the same
code prior to dialing the phone number of the person you're going to work
with.
   For tone dialing systems, *70 can be used instead but all pulse (rotary)
systems must use 1170. I was considering a second telephone line just for CIS
before this option was added, but now anyone calling will know that I'm home
but won't be able to mess with my $$$ files! I don't know what areas have
this option yet, but you can call your local phone company business office to
find out if it's available.
   Long live uncorrupted files!

But before you go, I should answer
the now famous question: How do I
disable the disable? Answer: Just
hang up! You have to use the code every
time you pick up the phone or redial.
