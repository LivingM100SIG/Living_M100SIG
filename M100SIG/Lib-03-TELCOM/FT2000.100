It is useful, at times, to view a text file, created on the Model 100, on an 80
column by 25 line screen, to search long files for certain keywords, or to edit
the text with a versatile word-processor.  This tip file describes a method of 
transferring the file to the Tandy 2000.

Required hardware and software:

  TRS-80 Model 100
  TANDY 2000 with MS-DOS and DeskMate
  RS-232 Communications Cable, Radio Shack Cat. No. 26-1408 with Null
  Modem Adaptor, Radio Shack Cat. No. 26-1496 or equivalent Null Modem 
  Cable

Procedure:

1. Interconnect the RS-232 ports on the two computers through a Null Modem

2. Boot the T2000 and load Deskmate from Drive A.

3. Put a formatted disk in Drive B.

4. On the menu, select Telecom.  The Stats menu will appear.  Set: 

   Autodial: No
   Baud Rate 1200 (9600 works at times, but not always)
   Data Word Length: 7 Bits
   Parity: None
   Number of Stop Bits: 1
   XON/XOFF: On
   Filters and Echo: Off.

5. Press F5 (Term).  Press F3 (Recv).  At the filename prompt, key "B:" 
followed by an appropriate filename and press ENTER.  The T2K is now ready and 
waiting.  There is no rush.

6. Turn on the Model 100 and display the file to be transferred.

7. Press F3 (Save), key COM:57N1E, and press ENTER.  The file will scroll 
through the display on the T2K and the B drive will run intermittently.  When 
the file transfer is completed, press BREAK on the T2K keyboard.  The disk 
drive will run briefly.  No other key will then have any effect.  Lockup.

8. Press the Reset switch on the CPU.  The computer will reboot without losing 
the file.

9. At the Model 100, the F8 key will bring back Menu.

If the transferred file is invoked from DeskMate, it will be corrupted -  
ragged left margin and other annoyances.  But, it can be invoked from a word 
processor, such as WordPerfect, in which case, it will fall into the preset 
line and print format, both of which can then be altered, if desired.
