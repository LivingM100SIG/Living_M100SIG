10 REM This is probably the shortest
11 REM useful program on this SIG.
12 REM After executing this program,
13 REM the TELCOM program will have
14 REM two additional functions:
15 REM F6 - Space - Returns an Ascii
16 REM	    text string containing the
17 REM	    number of Free bytes of RAM
18 REM	    left on the system.
19 REM F7 - Files - Returns the names
20 REM	    of all files currently in
21 REM	    RAM.
22 REM
23 REM These functions are status
24 REM reports and will display at
25 REM the current cursor position.
26 REM The screen will scroll, if
27 REM necessary.  This information is
28 REM NOT transmitted through the
29 REM RS-232/Modem port.
30 REM
31 REM To reset F6 and F7 back to their
32 REM previous undefined state, it
33 REM will be necessary to perform a
34 REM COLD START, or the program can
35 REM be re-executed with line 110
36 REM modified to read:
37 REM	    110 DATA 210,0,210,0
38 REM (Actually, this patch will
39 REM substitute an error BEEP for the
40 REM non-existant functions.
100 FORX=1TO4:READN:POKEX+64267,N:NEXTX
110 DATA172,126,58,31
120 REM Replace line 110 with:				DATA 201,0,201,0		to reset TELCOM F6 & F7
