                Software For The M100/T102 And An External Modem

  QHAYES = TELCOM for Hayes compatible modems.
  QTOUCH = TELCOM for the Touchbase Travelcomm modem.

  XHAYES = X-TEL interface for Hayes compatible modems.
  XTOUCH = X-TEL interface for the Touchbase Travelcomm modem.

  For those of you who have an external modem and find the lack of support a
real pain, here are two sets of programs that will make your life a lot easier.

  The first set of programs (Q) is a bread-and-butter auto-dialer - redialer -
auto-logon program that will jump to TELCOM as soon as the logon sequence is
complete.

  The second, (X) is an interface to X-TEL V2.1 and V2.2 which does the same
functions but with different procedures tailored to the way X-TEL works.

                           ---->VERY IMPORTANT!<----

          Before attempting to run any of the "X" type programs,
          PLEASE read the section on them!  I do not check to see if
          X-TEL has been relocated.  If you run a relocated version
          of X-TEL with the X-series, THE PROGRAM WILL BOMB.  Change
          the variable "D" in line 2 to indicate the TOP (or HIMEM)
          address of your version of X-TEL.  Also, the program
          assumes that you use the standard basic loader that is
          supplied with X-TEL (X-TEL.BA).  If you do not use that
          program name for your loader, change line 4 to reflect the
          new name that you have given the loader program.


  All of the programs use the ADRS.DO file to store phone numbers and
auto-logon strings.  The ADRS file can be in RAM or on the Chipmunk, DVI, or
Tandy Disk Drive (if an alternate operating system is installed); the program
will find it wherever it is.  If you already have your ADRS file set up, fine,
you are ready to start using the program.  If not, create one using the
procedures listed in the M100 User Manual, pages 89-92.  These programs use
EXACTLY the same syntax as the TELCOM program in the M100/T102 with one
exception: you cannot have any characters past the [ > ] in the auto logon
section.

                                   Commands:

                   [CR]........Find first/next phone number.
                   [ESC].......Go back to Find: prompt.     
                   [BKSP]......Go to top of program.        
                   [F8]........Menu or X-TEL.               
                   [DIAL]......Go to TELCOM for manual dial.
                   [any key]...Dial last number listed.     

  Anything that is inside of brackets - [] - is to be typed in.  Do not type
the brackets

                                   QHAYES.100
                                   QTOUCH.100
                            ------------------------

  To run the program, make sure you have a copy of your ADRS file in RAM or on
disk (for the TDD, you must have a DOS that supports BASIC to access from
disk).

  Upon entering the program, you will be able to make two decisions: each time
you depress [1], you will toggle the baud rate between 1200, 300 baud, and the
internal modem.

If you depress any other key, you should see the Find: prompt.  At this time
the above commands become active.  You can now type in the string you wish to
search for.  The program is designed to keep the keystrokes to a minimum, so if
you have your primary logon string as the first number in your ADRS file, all
you should have to do is hit [CR] and then any other key to start the autodial
process.  If you have the wrong number up on the screen, you can hit the [ESC]
key to get the find prompt back, or keep hitting [CR] to cycle through the ADRS
file.  If you hit the [BKSP] key, you will return to the top of the program to
allow selection of a different baud rate. Once you have found the number you
wish to call and hit a key, the rest of the process is automatic.  If not using
the internal modem, the program will check for or use the following Hayes
commands:

                                  ATDT        
                                  A/          
                                  CONNECT     
                                  CONNECT 1200
                                  NO CARRIER  
                                  BUSY        
                                  NO DIALTONE 

  The only commands that are critical are ATDT, CONNECT, A/, and NO CARRIER.
The rest will be ignored if your modem doesn't support them.  If you have
problems with these commands, please let me know, I'd be glad to make the
changes.

  If, while the program is redialing, you wish to go back to try another
number, (Find:) hit any key. If the program doesn't respond immediately, be
patient, it might take one more redial to recognize your keystroke. With the
internal modem, you may go back after the first time number is dialed as well
as after redials.

  *NOTE* There is no capability for redial with the Travelcomm modem. If you
wish to try the number again, you must press [SHIFT + BREAK] and then [F4]
(run) to try the program again.

  As you entered the program, you might have noticed the two function key
defintions.  (F6 & F7) The M100/T102 screen has a problem with 1200 baud
operation in that it will not scroll the screen at any thing over 600 baud.
This takes away the advantage of high speed operation on services such as
CompuServe that charge extra for 1200 baud.  But you can "beat the system" by
turning off the screen scroll during downloads.  The M100 will then receive at
any baud rate.  The only trade-off is that you will have to read what you have
downloaded offline.

  The two keys are to be used while online.  When you get to a point where you
want to download, hit the [F7] key.  At this point the screen will stop
scrolling and start printing on one line only.  You will still be able to see
prompts and do normal commands, but it will just be a bit more confusing until
you get used to it.  When finished with high speed downloads, hit the [F6] key
to return to normal operation.

                            ------------------------

  [All references to XHAYES apply to all "X" programs]

  Due to the nature of X-TEL, it will be necessary to make a small change to
XHAYES in order to make it run with a relocated version of X-TEL.  If you just
use the standard non-relocated version, this program is ready to run and you
can skip to the section on running XHAYES.

                              -------------------
                              Modifing XHAYES.100
                              -------------------

  To modify XHAYES, first you need to find out the number that you will insert
into the program.  That number is the TOP address of X-TEL.  To find it, you
can go into basic and type [LOADM"X-TEL].  Three numbers will print out, the
first of which is the TOP address that you are looking for.

  Another method would be to go into X-TEL, set your STAT for 57I1E, press
[F4], press and hold the [CODE & SHIFT] while pressing [F7].  This will get you
into X-TEL basic.  At this point, type [KEY LIST].  This will list the function
key definitions.  The definition for key 8 will be a CALL nnnnn.  That is the
number you will want to write down for XHAYES modification.

  After you get the number, go into basic, load XHAYES.DO, and enter [EDIT2].
You can then edit the number that is associated with the variable "D".  After
finishing, save the program.

                               ------------------
                               Running XHAYES.100
                               ------------------

  Since you need to access XHAYES while online, I have found that there are
several ways to load and run the program depending on how many keystrokes you
can tolerate.  I will assume in the following discussion that you have set
function key 7 to: RUN"XHAYES" 

Below is a line that can be merged into XHAYES to set function key 7.

3 KEY7,"Run " + CHR$(34) + CHR$(88) + CHR$(72) + CHR$(65) + CHR$(89) + CHR$(69)
+ CHR$(83) + CHR$(34) + CHR$(13)

  Run XHAYES from the main menu.  It will look for the loader program
(X-TEL.BA) and excecute it.  Once inside X-TEL, at the Telcom: prompt, press
[F4] (Term).  Next, go into X-TEL basic by pressing and holding [CODE + SHIFT]
while hitting the [F7] key.  Press the [F7] key again to excecute XHAYES again.
This time you will see the XHAYES menu.  The menu should be self explanitory.
When you select option 1 or 2, the program will toggle and update the screen
with the new status.  Once you press [CR], the program will start working
exactly like QHAYES.  The only exception is the method for disabling and
enabling screen scroll.  You have to go back into X-TEL basic every time you
want to toggle that option.

  First I'd like to thank Rich Young, Rick Perry, and Dan Drasin from whom I
pilfered mercilessly and Bill Templeton for excellent beta testing. But mostly
I'd like to thank Leonard Erickson whose fine bit of detective work finding the
entry point for the Telcom auto-logon routine really made the program possible.
