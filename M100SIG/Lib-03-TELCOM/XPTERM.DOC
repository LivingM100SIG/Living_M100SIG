                        -----------------------------


                              --- Overview ---

    XPTERM.CO is a full-featured, easy to use, machine language,
    Telecommunication program for the Tandy M100, M102 and T200
    computers.  For the first time, all the following capabilities have
    been integrated into one program!

      -- On-line disk access for transferring data directly to/from
         PDD1/2 disk files while remaining connected to the host
         computer: NO external DOS required!  Disk file size is limited
         only by PDD parameters, NOT by free RAM.  T200 can use either
         internal or external modem: M100/102 direct disk access with
         external modem only.

      -- Direct BINARY file transfer of .CO and .BA files to/from RAM or
         disk.

      -- XMODEM transfer protocol.

      -- On-line TEXT editing with automatic return to last file edit
         location.

      -- Auto-dialing of phone numbers and log-on strings from ANY  .DO
         file: not just ADRS.DO.

      -- 'Last number' memory and redial with automatic 30 sec.
         'time-out'.

      -- Automatic dialer 'stepping' to next file entry: indispensable
         for calling a list of entries.


    XPTERM can be used with both internal and external modems.  There
    are two system requirements for direct disk access with external
    modems:
        1> You'll need a manual 'A/B' switch which selects either the
           PDD or modem for the computer's serial port.
        2> The modem must be capable of holding the phone line
           connection when disconnected from the computer's serial port.


    XPTERM is comprehensive and you should read these instructions
    thoroughly to benefit from all its features.  Initial set-up
    procedures are detailed in "Initial Setup" at the end of this
    document.



                        --- General Instructions ---

    XPTERM operation is simple and intuitive: many of the familiar
    TELCOM keys have been retained and new features have been added to
    others.

      Conventions:

        SHIFT/BREAK aborts almost all functions.

        UPPER and lower case letters are interchangable.

        <ENTER> is ONLY used to complete some other typed command, NOT
        as a command itself.
        Keys with enhanced features are described below as SHIFT/Fk,
        CTRL/Fk or SHIFT/CTRL/Fk.  Press the appropriate SHIFT or CTRL
        keys simultaneously with the function key to invoke the feature.


      Modem ops:

        Although the standard, built-in TELCOM routines use a separate
        key, F4, to select "Term" status, XPTERM automatically enters
        "Term" status whenever a carrier is detected using the internal
        modem or whenever an external modem parameter is selected.

        The functions of F1(prev), F4(full/half duplex) and F5(echo) are
        the same as TELCOM.

        If you're using an external modem and transferring files to/from
        disk, then the prompts "Select DRIVE, press space bar.." and
        "Select MODEM, press space bar.." will tell you when to change
        the serial port device switch: then press SPACEBAR to continue.

        Each time XPTERM is run, your current TELCOM "Stats" will become
        the system default.  SHIFT/F4 can be used as explained below to
        change the value of the first digit: BAUD RATE.  Any other
        changes to communications parameters must be made BEFORE running
        XPTERM.

        Other program/operational errors are displayed as numeric
        expressions: a list of their meanings can be found under "Error
        Codes" near the end of these instructions.

        Any previous 'hooks' set for TELCOM F6 and/or F7 will be cleared
        by XPTERM use.


      Files:

        The complete filename PLUS extension is needed for any filename
        entry.

        Whenever F2, F3 or F7 is pressed, a directory of RAM files is
        displayed, followed by the prompt "File?".  A list of the files
        on the currently loaded disk can then be displayed if a ":"
        (colon) is entered alone at the "File?" prompt.  Enter a ";"
        (semi-colon), instead, to display directory "2" on the PDD2.

        Disk file-names for UP or DOWNload are designated with a ":"
        (colon) prefix: use a ";" (semi-colon) to designate PDD2 Bank 2
        files.


      Xmodem use:

        Xmodem transfer protocol is OPTIONAL for .DO files: Xmodem is
        MANDATORY and automatically selected for .BA and .CO files.


        ONLY "Y" or "N" is accepted at the .DO file "Xmodem? Y/N"
        prompt.

        During XMODEM operations an "Xfrd: 0     Err: 0" message will
        display.  This lets you keep track of bytes transferred as well
        as any data blocks in which a transmission "Err" was detected:
        XPTERM will try each block up to 10 times and aborts the
        transfer if a block is not correctly transferred in 10 tries.
        (This condition is often caused by exceptionally noisy
        transmission lines or incompatible transfer protocols.)




                       --- Function Key Operation ---

    F1 (Prev)
      Displays previous screen: same as TELCOM.

    SHIFT/F1 (M100/102 scroll method)
      Normal screen scroll speed on the M100/102 limits maximum
      effective transfer rate to about 600 baud: SHIFT/F1 changes the
      scroll method, wrapping vertically instead of scrolling, increasing
      the maximum 'screen rate' close to about 2400 baud.


    F2 (Down)
      Make sure your source computer is ready to send data.  Press F2
      and type the RECEIVING file name with extension and press <ENTER>:
      remember ":" or ";" prefix for disk files.
        The complete filename PLUS extension is needed for any filename
        entry.  The first character of the extension that you give
        at the prompt determines the file's type:
        B for Basic, D for text, C for binary data and
        machine language programs.

      If the same name file exists in the receiving media, the prompt
      "A)ppend  R)eplace  Q)uit" will appear: make the appropriate
      choice.  "Append" works only for .DO files.

      If the receiving file is a .DO file, you'll be prompted "Xmodem?
      Y/N": ONLY a "Y" or "N" is accepted.  If the receiving file is a
      .BA or .CO binary file, Xmodem protocol is automatically selected
      and the "Xfrd: 0     Err: 0" message displays.

      Xmodem automatically ends the DOWNload function when both
      computers agree that the entire file has correctly transferred.
      Non-Xmodem DOWNloads are ended by you with a second F2 keypress.

      To abort any type DOWNload at any time, press F2.
      An aborted DOWNload to RAM or disk is retained only if a .DO file.

      The number of bytes received for Xmodem DOWNloads will display in
      128 byte increments next to the word "Xfrd:".  Errors causing
      automatic re-sends will show next to "Err:".  Non-Xmodem DOWNloads
      will display the number of received bytes in 32 byte increments
      next to the label "Down" in reverse video.

      In addition to XMODEM transmission protocol, XPTERM incorporates
      File FORMAT-checking routines which 'verify' that .DO, .BA and .CO
      files are downloaded with the correct extension.  This process
      ABORTS the download when an illegal character or 'inappropriate'
      program logic is detected during download of any of the three
      file-types.  The message: "Verify failed" / "Aborted" will display
      and the XMODEM transfer will be terminated.  If repeated attempts
      to download a particular file fail the verification process, the
      source file-type is probably incorrect, the file is corrupted or
      it is an irregular file-type.


    F3 (Up)
      Prepare the receiving computer to accept your data.  Press F3 and
      enter the filename with any required prefixes and extensions.

      If you are UPloading a .DO file, you'll be prompted "Xmodem? Y/N":
      ONLY a "Y" or "N" is accepted.  If "N" is chosen, then the
      familiar "Width:" prompt displays.  Press <ENTER> alone to send
      file as stored or enter any number from 10 to 132.

      NOTE: If you choose "N", and your default communication 'STATS'
      are 7 data bits, then any characters in your file with an ASCII
      value above 126 may produce unreliable results.  Any .DO files
      containing these characters should be UPloaded with Xmodem
      protocol.

      If the source file is a .BA or .CO binary file, Xmodem protocol is
      automatically selected, the "Xfrd: 0     Err: 0" message displays
      and transmission begins.

      Xmodem automatically ends the UPload function when both computers
      agree that the entire file has correctly transferred.  Non-Xmodem
      UPloads end when the entire file has been sent.

      To abort any type UPload at any time, press F3.


    F4 (Full/Half duplex)
      Switches between 'Full' or 'Half"-duplex operations.  Although the
      effect of this key is the same as TELCOM's, the half-duplex mode
      has been enhanced for non-Xmodem UPloads so that characters are
      displayed as they're sent.

    SHIFT/F4 (Baud)
      Press this key combination to change or confirm the current telcom
      baud-rate.  0 (zero) selects the internal 300 baud modem and 1-9
      conforms to the various Tandy baud equates.  XPTERM's maximum
      Xmodem speed is 9600.


    F5 (Echo)
      Functions as in TELCOM to send incoming screen data to a printer.

    SHIFT/F5 (Form-Feed)
      Sends a CHR$(12) to your printer to force a page/form-feed.

    CTRL/F5 (CR + CR)
      "Toggles" between LF-on-CR and LF-on-LF to accomodate different
      printers or enable double-spaced printing.


    ALL F6 (Dial) Functions
      XPTERM waits 30 seconds for a carrier then hangs-up and either
      waits for further instructions or dials the next number.

      XPTERM supports the 'Hayes' external modem communication protocols
      and sends the appropriate 'AT' command set to your modem to
      'dial' and 'disconnect' when external modem stats are
      selected and dialing sequences are used.  XPTERM expects your
      external modem to return a "CONNECT.." message upon carrier detect
      in order to enter the online mode.

      SHIFT/BREAK or any key aborts current number dialing: SHIFT/BREAK
      or CTRL/C breaks the 'loop' if dialing with SHIFT/CTRL/F6.

    F6 (Dial)
      Hangs-up the phone line and prompts for a number string to dial.
      XPTERM enters "Term" status if carrier is detected: F6 is then
      suppressed.

    SHIFT/F6 (Dial last)
      Displays and dials the FIRST sequence of digits found after the
      last cursor position in the last RAM .DO file edited: first
      character in ADRS.DO is default when XPTERM is first run.

    CTRL/F6 (Dial next)
      Automatically displays and dials the SECOND sequence of digits
      found after the last cursor position in the last RAM .DO file
      edited and advances the file position pointer by one set: the
      second line in ADRS.DO is default when XPTERM is first run.

    SHIFT/CTRL/F6 (Dial list until connect)
      Automatically dials a list of numbers in the target file until one
      of them connects or List End is reached.

      List End is a line that doesn't contain a phone number: blank
      line, end of file etc.

      If CAPS LOCK is down then XPTERM loops back to the list start and
      begins again.

    NOTE: ALL F6 functions are suppressed when a carrier is detected.
    They are restored when the online connection is broken and F8
    displays "Exit".


    F7 (Edit)
      Use this key to edit a RAM TEXT file while online: your connection
      to the other computer will be maintained.  When finished with your
      file, press F8 and you'll return to XPTERM online. "Term: (stats)
      and "CARRIER" will display to confirm that you've re-entered
      terminal mode.  While editing the file, you may use any of the
      normal text functions.

      T200 users may also use SHIFT/PRINT and  F4 "List" routines.  T200
      users running the internal modem should NOT, however, use "List"'s
      F8 "Menu" key to exit the file or you'll wind up offline, out of
      XPTERM and back at the T200 Main Menu.

    SHIFT/F7 (Edit last file)
      XPTERM 'remembers' the last file you edited and your place in it.
      Press SHIFT/F7 to return to the last edited file with the cursor
      positioned at its last location.  (This feature is particularly
      useful when responding on-line to a lengthy downloaded message.)


    F8 (Exit) or (HgUp)
      When the F8 label reads "Exit", F8 returns to the computer Main
      Menu.  Once a carrier has been detected, this label changes to
      "HgUp".

      Pressing F8 (HgUp) while online prompts "Disconnect?" and ONLY a
      "Y" will disconnect.  If "Y" is entered, then the modem connection
      is terminated and you return to XPTERM's entry menu: F8 then
      displays "Exit" and F6 is re-activated for further dialing.
      When using an external modem, F8 Hgup may fail to hangup properly;
      use CTRL/F4 to resend hangup command to modem.

    SHIFT/F8 (XPUSR.CO)
      This function will run any .CO program in RAM named XPUSR.CO
      without changing online status.  See the section below for its
      required operating conditions.



                              --- XPUSR.CO ---

    You can name any .CO program which meets the following conditions as
    XPUSR.CO, and SHIFT/F8 will run it for you from RAM any time during
    XPTERM ops.  For successful online operation, XPUSR.CO must conform
    to these parameters:
        1) XPUSR.CO must not run in the same memory location used by
           XPTERM.CO.
        2) XPUSR.CO should be a well-behaved program, one that
           balances the stack upon exit and returns to the caller,
           instead of doing a lazy escape to Menu.

      Here is a simple, 2-step method to confirm these conditions.
        1) Enter BASIC with XPTERM.CO and your XPUSR.CO program on the
           menu.  Type LOADM"XPTERM" and make a note of the "Top" and
           "End" values.  Then type LOADM"USER" and compare its "Top"
           address to the values noted for XPTERM.  If the "Top" value
           of XPUSR.CO equals any value between and including the "Top"
           and "End" values of XPTERM then it will NOT run as XPUSR.CO
           from XPTERM's SHIFT/F8 key.
        2) If step 1 is Ok, then run XPUSR.CO using the RUNM"XPUSR.CO"
           command.  (You may have to clear HIMEM first if needed.)  Now
           exit XPUSR.CO in its 'usual' manner.  You MUST return to
           BASIC at the "Ok" prompt in order to use XPUSR.CO with
           XPTERM.  If XPUSR.CO exits to the Main Menu then it is NOT a
           candidate for online use.


                             --- Error Codes ---

    These error codes may be returned with a Beep during XPTERM
    operations.  XPTERM will print "ERROR " followed by one of these
    numbers and return to the program status prior to the prompt or
    command which caused the error.

      7 - Memory is full
     18 - I/O error (perhaps PDD not ready)
     52 - File not found (UPload)
     55 - Bad file name
     57 - RAM directory is full
     96 - PDD disk is full


                            --- Initial Setup ---

    1> Download either XPTERM.100 or XPTERM.200
    2> Convert it to a BASIC file and BACK IT UP!
    3> Set HIMEM to the value needed by any other .CO programs which
       will be installed when using XPTERM: use the CLEAR,vvvvv
       statement.  XPTERM will be created to run just under the HIMEM
       value you enter.  (Remember that XPTERM does NOT require any
       other DOS to function correctly).
    4> With about 7k of free RAM, run the BASIC file to create the
       program XPTERM.CO.
    5> BACK-UP the program file XPTERM.CO!
    6> Kill the BASIC file.

    XPTERM can be run by cursor selection from the main menu as long as
    the correct HIMEM value for your version has been set.  Determine
    this value by entering BASIC and typing: LOADM"XPTERM"  press
    <ENTER>.

    The "Top" value displayed is the HIMEM value to be set whenever
    XPTERM is run.  You can do this manually for each XPTERM use or you
    can create a small BASIC loader program to do it for you.  Here is a
    simple program which clears correct HIMEM and runs XPTERM.CO.  Use
    the "Top" value of your XPTERM version for "v".

      0 'RUNXPT.BA
      1 CLEAR0,v:RUNM"XPTERM"



                            --- Memory Requirements ---

      When transfering files to and from disk, free memory is used as buffer,
      so particularly if you are using an external modem,
      you would want to have enough free memory to avoid excessive
      switching between disk and modem.


                          --- Acknowledgements ---

              Randy Hess did extensive Beta testing and made
              many suggestions for program operation.  He also
              assisted in the preparation of the DOCs.
