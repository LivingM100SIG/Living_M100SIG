upon payment of $50 for the first copy and $20 for each additional copy made of
the program and/or documentation, will be provided original, registered copies
of the programs and documentation, and will receive the consideration stated
above, should revisions become available within one year of registration.  Use
of the program by business entities without registration is a violation of the
copyright and the proprietary nature of the software.  OMNI can also tailor
PCXFER to specific business needs.

	 Resale of PCXFER and related files and programs is expressly
prohibited, even when such sale is for nominal cost, such as "disk fees",
"postage and handling", or as part of a library of public domain, free,
user-supported, or other software. 

	ANY user is granted permission to distribute the software and
documentation to others for evaluation, provided that all files, including this
one, are included in the distribution, that no changes whatsoever are made
to the programs, including this text and all copyright notices contained in
the software and documentation, and that those individuals agree to be bound by
the terms of this agreement.

of such damages by you or any other party.  Your use of this program shall
constitute agreement to these terms.  
PCXFER INSTALLATION  

	On this disk, you'll find PCXFER.DOC (this file), PCXFER.EXE,
INSTALL.PCX, and SETUP.XFR.   PCXFER is the compiled code which can be called
directly from DOS.  REName it if you wish.  INSTALL is an ASCII Basic file
which will reside on your portable (about 1K in length).  SETUP is your
"permanent", but easily changed, system setup file, which can be used to set
screen colors, communications ports and disk drives.  

	First step is to copy *.* to a formatted system disk.  Next, connect
the PC and the portable, following the manufacturer's instructions.  This
usually means connecting the serial ports using a null modem cable or adapter.
Type 'PCXFER' on the PC and, for now, select B (file transfer).  Ignore any
color problems.  They're easily fixed later.  Select (D)ownload. 

	(Note:  "Upload" and "Download" as used in PCXFER always consider the
PC as the host and the portable as the remote.  An upload is a transfer of a
file from the portable;  a download is a transfer from the PC.  As a rule of
thumb, the PC program should always be initiated before bringing up the
companion program on your portable.) 

	 If the drive and the port shown are the right ones for your PC, all is
well.  If not, follow the prompts to change as necessary.  E(X)it the setup
utility (if you used it).  Hit 'Z' to begin the transfer.  Direction is 'D'. 
If your file will normally be on a drive other than A:, you should select (A)
-- full system setup from the menu after completing the installation.  A: is
the default drive, and changing it from (C) on the menu is only temporary.

	 Please note:  in the following paragraphs, information enclosed in
brackets -- { and } -- is specific to the Tandy Model 100.  For other
portables, follow the instructions that came with your computer for ASCII file
transfers.  Parameters are: 7 bit words, even parity, 1 stop bit, 9600 baud,
XON/XOFF (if available) enabled.  Other available parameters don't matter. 

	{Go to 'TEXT' <Enter> on the 100; name the 'File to edit' as
'PCXFER.DO' <Enter>, and hit F2 (for the last time!). Respond COM:87E1E <Enter>
to the 'Load from:' prompt.  The portable will appear to freeze.} 

	Ignore the instructions on the PC and hit <Enter> on the PC.  You
should see a list of files that includes INSTALL.PCX.  Type in INSTALL.PCX
<Enter>, using ALL capital letters or all lower case.  When the transfer is
complete, select the 'end' option on the PC.  (INSTALL.PCX will not work
properly if it is renamed, and that name should not be used for any other
file.) 

	{On the portable, hit F8.  Select BASIC from the menu.  Type 'LOAD
"PCXFER.DO."' <Enter>.  At the 'OK' prompt, type 'SAVE"PCXFER.BA"' <Enter>.  At
the next OK prompt, hit F8 and you're in business.} 
OPERATION 

	The instructions above were typical of computer file transfers, but,
from now on, all you'll have to do is follow a couple of menus and enter a few
keystrokes for fast, accurate file transfers. 

	PCXFER is designed only for the transfer of text files. If you want to
move Basic programs back and forth, save them as text files on the portable
(the ".DO" extension or equivalent), or with the ",A" option on the PC. 
Similarly, text documents prepared on a PC word processor should be save
as "DOS" files or run through the word processor's utility that converts
formatted files to "standard" files.  No harm will be done if this step is not
taken, but you'll probably find some unexpected control (^) characters in the
portable file, and may have to do a little reformatting.  No text should be
lost, however.   


A FEW NOTES ON HOW PCXFER WORKS 

	The PC program was written in Basic and compiled using IBM's BASCOM
1.0.  It is permanently set to 9600 baud, and is fully capable of working at
that speed -- the fastest available in PC-DOS and MS-DOS through version 3.1. 
The actual rate will be somewhat slower for downloads because PCXFER waits for
acknowledgement from the portable that each block of text (128 characters) has
been received and written to a file.  This extra step is necessary to assure
that the transfer is accurate.  It could have been speeded up from it's already
fast rate (about 20,000 characters per minute), but not without setting aside
memory on the portable, or complicating the transfer process. 

	In the upload direction, the rate is even faster, since PCXFER has a
built-in 10K buffer to catch any overflow. 

	PCXFER should work on any IBM computer or clone using PC-DOS or MS-DOS
version 1.0 or later.  It contains no machine-specific routines that are
frequently the cause of incompatibility problems.   

	 If your portable is not a Model 100, PCXFER should work with some
minor adjustments to the PCXFER.BA file.  You may make these changes for your
own use, but may not distribute the program with them without prior
permission.  You should be able to convert the short portable program by
adjusting the LOCATE or PRINT@ statements to suit your machine. You may also
need to change the statement that opens the COM file -- 'C="COM:87E1E"'.  Use
the parameters above with XON/XOFF (if available) enabled.
