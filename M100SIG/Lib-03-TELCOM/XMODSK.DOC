xmodsk.100 is a modification of sxm.ba a modification of Rick Perry's
'xmodem' allowing you data transfer via rs 232 even if you use the built
in modem of m100.

xmodsk.100 works fine with AMPRO little board computer using the
utility 'pip' of cp/m dos. It should work with any cp/m desktop without
problems.
A modification for ms dos should be possible by changing the 'pip'
comands in ms dos comands.

IMPORTANT: cp/m system and 'pip' must be on each disk you want transfer
data to.

You also have to open a little file called 'year' containing just '86'.
That ensures a correct year in date$ after leaving the program.

Uploading from disk is not implemented.
But xmodsk.100 keeps track of your logon times in a file 'cislog'.

All functions of TELCOM including dialing of normal phone calls
remain intact.


BUT THERE IS A CATCH!

M100 needs a tiny little change in its hardware that means you have to
be able to handle a soldering iron in a professonal way otherwise you
will ruin your nice little m100.

Partslist:
 T1,T2    npn transistor   (rs part# 276-1603)     2 pcs
 R1,R2    resistor 3.3kohm (rs part# 271-1328)     2 pcs
          part of pc-board (rs part# 276-148)      1 pc

Procedure:

Put T1,T2,R1,R2 on a piece (about stamp size) of the pc-board and make the
following connections
        T1-base to T2-collector
        T1-base to R1
        T1-emitter to T2-emitter
        T2-base to R2
        wire-1 to T2-emitter
        wire-2 to T1-collector
        wire-3 to free end of R1
        wire-4 to free end of R2
Now connect the free ends of
        wire-1 to pin 20 of IC M25 (gnd)
        wire-2 to anode of diode D16
        wire-3 to pin 35 of IC M25 (pb6)
        wire-4 to pin 36 of IC M25 (pb7)
The idea of the whole procedure is to find a way to keep relais RY2
energized if the program switches to com:.
If you can do it you will have a fast and reliable mass storage during
your sessions with cis just for

        *** 5.60$can ***.

If you are member of a user group there shouldn't be any problem to find
a fellow doing the job for you.


The main modifications against sxm.ba are in lines :

09 causes a fast 'down' to ram: but
10 enables a 'down' to cas: or com: using
   the xoffon protokoll.
15 if p=4 (= 'down' to com:) there are
   subroutine jumps to line 43 or 44.
16 ...poke-190,175 - reenables the xoffon procedure.
20 sends <CR> automaticly to start xmodem downloading
27 and
30 also make subroutine jumps to line
   43 and 44 for the xmodem protokoll.
43 forh=0to2:a(h)=peek(h-122):next - saves the buffer pointers
   out186,64orinp(186) - saves rel. RY2
   this is the comand the hardware change was made for.
   call28277,0,2304 - changes the baudrate to 19,200
   poke-190,0 - disables the xoffon procedure which makes trouble
   in cp/m dos.
   out186,247andinp(186) - switches from mdm: to com:.
44 call28277,0,768 - resets baudrate to 300.
   out186,8orinp(186) - switches back to mdm:.
   forh=0to2:pokeh-122,a(h):next - restores the buffer pointers.
57 if you answer the question 'save to:' with 'dsk:' then a cp/m - pip
   comand will be sent to open a .txt file on disk.
59 in case of down to ram: by just inputting the file name
   (without ram:) d will be set to +1 enabling the fast trf in line 9.
74 opens 'year' to ensure a correct year after leaving the program.
83 opens a com: file for output as #4.
88 lets you start the session exact on time.
90 opens a com: file for input as #3 to check the correct settings in
   the desktop.
91 checks the settings in the desktop.
92 if there is no desktop (you are travelling) you can continue without
93 starts 'pip' of cp/m dos.
94 checks the settings again.
101 opens the file 'cislog' and registers start and end of the session.

I'm sure this will start some kind of discussion and I will appreciate
any kind of feedback.
