   PBXCHG.100 changes phone numbers in 
your ADRS.DO file, adding or deleting 
prefixes required by switchboards.  It 
is written specifically for use on our 
CENTREX system, to use only the last 4 
digits for in-house dialing.   You 
might be able to modify it for other 
systems... sorry, I don't know enough 
about them to help.

To use:
1) Your ADRS.DO file must be set up 
with proper colons and dashes. (I have 
NOT tried it with '=' embedded.)  
Numbers  must be formatted like this:
 In house      - :555-1212: or :1212:
 Local, outside- :888-4414:
 Long Distance - :1-817-390-3700:
 (CIS, Source, DJNS as above + logon)

2) Edit lines 20 and 25, inserting your
CENTREX prefix in PF$, and your home 
area code in AC$.

3) Run the program.  When asked for 
"Access code", enter the following:
  At work       :"9"
  At home	: <ENTER>
  Traveling	:"8" (required by most
		    hotels.  I find few

		    of their systems
		    will accept auto-
		    dial, but you can
		    try it anyway.  
Adds		    8-1-home area code.
)
   Be aware the program uses a 
temporary file ADS.DO, and be sure 
there's no conflict.
		Good dialing...Ed Juge
