     Over the course of a trip I just took to Chicago and New York, I noted
some ideosyncrasies related to the technique of hooking the direct connect
cable of a Model 100 to the contacts of the microphone part of a telephone
handset.  As has been noted years back in the data base here, unscrewing the
microphone part of a telephone handset and hooking in the M100 direct connect
cable using alligator or similar clips affords a convenient way to make a
direct connection to, say, a hotel telephone which does not use accessible
modular connectors.  I tested this techique out at my house prior to my trip
and it worked flawlessly.  When I got to the Hyatt in Woodside, Chicago, I
tried the same technique.  Curiously, I got a LOUSEY connection... garbage kept
creeping in to the data.  It was utterly unuseable.  I tried it four times and
had the same problem.  Then I whipped out my trusty swiss army knife and
unscrewed the telephone set and hooked my clips directly to the incoming red
and green wires inside the telephone unit itself.  This TOTALLY cured the
problem. Later, in Queens, New York, I found that clipping in to the microphone
contacts worked flawlessly.  I'm not sure why in one place the technique worked
and in another it was useless... it mnight releate to ideosyncrasies of the
switching system used by the hotel... but I wanted to share these observations
with those here.  Between the clip in to the microphone contacts and clip in to
the incoming phone wires of a disassembled phone, I can now make direct
conection to all except public pay phones. Thus, my need for those expensive,
bulky, heavy, and easily damaged acoustic cups is very limited.

Well, your msg is a typical report of the kinds of problems inherent in using
telephone services from unknown systems, and in unknown locations. As such,
it's a valuable contribution to the literature.  But if you're looking for an
explanation, you've come to the wrong party.

In the case of the Hilton, remember many of the phone systems in large
industrial or commercial installations are installed by the lowest bidder.
(read "cheapest")  I had occassion to work with the phone systems at the MGM
Grand in Reno, NV., and while it was generally a good system, it was erratic.

What with todays proliferation of odd-ball and bastardized equipment
installations, it's impractical to assume the same technique will work every
time, in every location.  You just have to try, and find what will work every
time you find one of these unknown systems.

Personally, I would always prefer going into the incoming line wires, rather
than in going into the instrument.  With many of the new instruments, made in
foreign countries, with parts of unknown quality, you just don't know what to
expect.

There was an article I read once, perhaps it was in one of the files here, I'll
have to check; but it suggested a "kit" for those who often had to rely on
telephone systems, or equipment, or unknown origin, quality, or service.  The
kit included modular cords, adapters, screwdriver, clips, etc.; all the little
things you might need to get connected to unusual phone services.  Acoustic
cups was considered a final alternative, if nothing else worked.  I have a
similar phone kit, but it includes a linemans handset, tone dialers, modular
and four-prong connectors, isolation transformers, amplifiers, lots of
adapters, and a notch filter.  I have never yet found a phone system I could
not get into.

What we need is a good induction coil arrangement (that would get around the
Tip/Ring separation problem).

There have been induction coils for use with telephone recorders and other
other such uses for years, where one needs to recover audio from the phone
line.  There once was one shaped like a ring that fit around the earpiece, and
you could send audio both ways with it, ie either recording from the phone, or
sending taped messages into the phone.  There was also one that attached to the
side of the phone base, next to the transformer in the phone, and inductively
coupled the audio into a recorder.

I still think the "kit" idea, with adapters, modular cords, clips and a
screwdriver, to be the most effective, and it's available now!

As for tip-ring, when you are connecting to the line, or transferring data, the
tip-ring polarities don't matter, you are transferring AC (audio) and the
tip-ring protocol is primarily a DC protocol.

I recognize that many users who travel, want to keep their "extra" baggage down
to a minimum, but we're talking about a hand-full of items in such a kit, that
couldn't possibly weight a pound, nor take up as much space as an electric
razor in it's case.  Ideally, everyone would like to carry something about the
size and weight of a wood pencil, that would allow instant connection, no
matter what the phone system, and perform reliably, with 100% efficiency from
anywhere in the world.  Sadly, the world's phone systems won't work that way.

The only one who ever had such a device was Napoleon Solo, and it only worked
on "Channel D".  ("Open Channel D")

That suggestion to put together a fewe useful tools and plugs of the trade into
a little bundle for on the road use is a really good one... I was sorta
beginning to do that by default myself in that last trip (the first trip I took
since getting the M100 a month ago).  Thanks very much for the suggestion.  I
already was carrying my swiss army knife, a female to female modular adaptor,
the M100 direct cable, and a male modular to alligator clips cable.  That was
fully adequate for that last trip, as my note implied.  But now I think I'll
get  together a more formal, packaged bag of those tricks, and maybe one or two
other items (four prong connector and some other stuff).

     I left that note as a novice M100 user, just to share what appeared to me
to be s somewhat puzzling experience.  Thanks again for your very long and
thorough reply!!!

For those interested in tips on connecting into the phone system, I
suggest you read the files CLIPS.HLP and CLIPS2.HLP in DL7, the first uploaded
by Tim Ekdom, and the second by Michael A. Lampert.
