                                   ***** ********


            Consistent with the Model 100/102 basic premise, the program has
        been made as user friendly as possible. Extensive new error trapping
        and reporting has been added since earlier versions. As well as using
        all the Model 100/102 error codes, and those of connected devices,
        the following new error messages have been included:

                 ERROR #          MESSAGE

             In the event of an Error after log-on to CIS, the program will
        automatically log-off CIS, record usage, and leave a message for the

        which the error was experienced. This information will appear in the
        file EM8ERR.DO.

            There are two more screens used by EM8SIG.400. We will close our
        discussion with them.

            If, at the Option Screen, page 4, you had answered "N"
        instead of "Y", you would immediately jump to the manual log-on
        screens. The first of these is the Access Number Screen.

            If you are using the log-on sequence which is titled CIS, just
        press <ENTER>. If, however, you wish to use one of the other log-on
        sequences in your ADRS.DO file, you simply enter in the correct
        title. Suppose you wished to dial through another access number you
        have titled CIS2. Then on this screen, simply type in "CIS2" without
        the quotes and press <ENTER>. In either case you will then go to the
        Auto-Time Screen.

        NOTE: If you use the "Quick Start" or Function Key method of acessing
              CIS, EM8SIG will -always- use the first CIS in your PIN.DO
              file. Therefore, the acess number used the most should be your
              first entry in that file.

            In the upper right hand corner of the Auto-Time Screen you will
        see the current time running. If you wish to immediately log on,
        simply press <ENTER>. If you have option 6 on the "Auto-Forum (Sig)
        Option Menu" screen, page 8, set to "NO" EM8SIG will log-on, access
        ONLY the EMAIL section and then log-off. If you wish to manually
        log-on and access a forum as well as EMAIL, you must change option 6
        to "YES".

                             AUTO LOG-ON AT PRESET TIME

            To me, this is one of the neatest features of EM8SIG.400,
        particularly if you have to call long-distance to get onto CIS as I
        do. Look at the screen presentation on the previous page again. Now,
        let's assume you wish to have EM8SIG log on for you at 11:00 p.m.
        Remember that the M100/102 uses a 24 hour clock. Type in "23:00:00"
        without the quotes. You must type a seconds entry even if it is "00".
        Don't forget to separate the hours, minutes and seconds with a colon
        ":". The time must be in six digits. 9:00 a.m. would be typed,
        "09:00:00". After entering your time, press <ENTER>. The middle line
        of your screen now changes to:

                           Auto-Email set for:   23:00:00

            EM8SIG.400 will wait until the time sequence and your entry match
        and then will run through the auto-log-on procedure just as if you
        had been there at 11:00 p.m. and pressed <ENTER>.

            Long distance rates are cheaper at night. Also, not many people,
        except maybe Stan Wong or Mike Nugent are up communing with CIS at
        01:00 or 02:00 a.m. Therefore the system runs faster and on-line time
        is shortened.

            There is one Caveat I must mention though. If, during the timed
        log-on, for any reason the CIS network locks-up, which does happen
        occasionally, EM8SIG does not know it should log-off. Eventually,
        the CIS network will disconnect you. But that could be some time in
        the nature of 20 to 30 minutes. In the meantime EM8SIG.400 just sits
        and waits for something else to happen. (We could program just so
        much intelligence into this thing you know.) I know of no way around
        this problem. However, I have used EM8SIG in this manner many times
        and only experienced the lock-up twice. But I did want you to know it
        could happen.

            Your CIS parameters must be set to certain values for EM8SIG to
        operate correctly.  GO DEFAULT or GO PROFILE to check your terminal
        settings. Select the "Session vs. Permanent" menu selection.  You
        should get the following listing:
