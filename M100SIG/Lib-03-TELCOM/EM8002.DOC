            This is the Option Screen and is the first screen you see after
        the opening banner has run. From the moment the opening banner
        begins, and throughout the program, unless otherwise specified, the
        Function Keys are live and may be pressed to carry out their various
        activities. If they are pressed while the opening banner is still
        running, the activity will occur as soon as the banner finishes.
        Therefore, at this time we will discuss these keys and what they do.


            <F1> "Quick starts" the program anytime from the start of the
                 opening banner until the "on time sub" starts dialing. (See
                 page 17.) It OVERRIDES any Forum Option Menu Item 6 setting
                 (see page 8) and causes the program to log off from CIS
                 after sending/receiving -only- EMAIL messages.


            <F2> "Quick starts" the program anytime from the start of the
                 opening banner until the "on time sub" starts dialing. It
                 causes the program to perform FULL EMAIL AND FORUM FUNCTIONS
                 including the downloading of New Message Headers.


            <F3> "Quick starts" the program the same as <F2> and performs the
                 same functions with the exception it -does not- download the
                 Forum Message Headers.


            <F4> Enters the "Forum Selection" Menu. This provides a rapid
                 method to select different Forums/Sigs for access by <F2>,
                 <F3>, <F5>, and <F6>. Go to page 12.


            <F5> "Quick starts" the program and performs the same SIG
                 functions as <F2> without taking a mandatory detour through
                 the EMAIL system. This is handy if you have picked up your
                 EMAIL and SIG messages in an earlier session and are
                 responding only to SIG business.


            <F6> "Quick starts" the program and performs the same SIG
                 functions as <F3>, again, without the mandatory detour
                 through EMAIL.






                                        4


        


        NOTE: A Forum Option Menu Item 6 setting of "YES" overrides <F3>,
              <F5>, and <F6>. (See page 8.)


            <F7> Calls up the EMAIL/Forum Message Compose Routine. Go to page
                 22.


            <F8> "Aborts" the program to the main MENU anytime after the
                 start of the opening banner until the first Time appears on
                 the LCD after a CIS Logon. THIS IS THE CORRECT WAY TO EXIT
                 THE PROGRAM.


        NOTE: At some points in the program <F8> seems to have no effect.
              When this happens simply press <F8> and then <ENTER>.


            <SHIFT><BREAK> stops program execution at anytime and enters
        BASIC. Typing "GOTO 500" enters the M100/102's Telecom program.
        [We suggest then typing a <CTRL><C> to trigger the Interrupt Menu
        before proceeding further if you are still logged on to CIS.]


        NOTE: "Quick Starts" means the skipping of the Option, Access #, and
              Auto-Time menus and going directly to the program's auto
              dial/logon routine.


            Two other options are available from this opening menu.


            "N" takes you directly to the Access # screen. Goto page 27.


            "Y" takes you through the Option Menus which is where the
        personalization of the program is done. There are three(3) Option
        sub-menus. They are the: 1) EasyPlex Email Menu, 2) Forum/Sig Menu,
        and 3) the General Menu.


            DO NOT TRY TO RUN THE PROGRAM WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THIS STEP
            FIRST. Goto page 6.

            Pressing ANY number takes you into the BASIC EDIT mode and
        presents the following screen after first showing the instruction
        PRESS <F8><F4> AFTER EDIT


                       ______________________________________

            If you wish to change any of the above, use the normal EDIT
        procedures. That is use the <DEL/BKSP> to delete the words between
        the first set of quotes and then type in your choice. As an example,
        suppose you wished to change the incoming EMAIL from README.DO to
        INMAIL.DO. Delete the README.DO between the quotes and type in
        INMAIL.DO. Remember names for DO files cannot exceed 6 characters in
        length.


            Another choice is to change README.DO to LPT: so it will look
        like this "LPT:". Use this as the incoming-message file name for
        hard-copying your incoming mail. NOTE: "LPT:" is the -complete- file
        name --- -not- just a prefix! [CAS:README.DO also works well.]


            EM8SIG, vers4.0, fully supports the use of Holmes/PSCG Chipmunk
        Disk Drive (CDD), the Tandy Disk/Video Interface (DVI), the PSCG
        64/96K Expansion Ram ver2.5 and later (RAM+), the Cassette Tape unit
        (CAS), or a printer (LPT).


            The Tandy Disk Drive (TDD) and the PG design Expansion Ram (PGD)
        can be used only as mass storage devices.




                                        6


        


            In the case of the TDD, the Model 100/102 hardware does not allow
        simultaneous use of the modem and the RS232 port.


            In the case of the PGD units, their software/firmware does not
        currently allow active data exchange beween RAM banks.


            File prefixes are required ONLY when using M100/102 accessories.
        Any prefix which is normally recognized by these various accessories
        is permissable. NOTE: The cassette can be used for only one preset
        function per session, either play or record.


            If a wrong file prefix is used, the program will automatically
        abort with an error message plus a signoff if CIS has already been
        accessed.


        CAUTION: Be -very sure- your printer is turned on and ready -if- you
        select to name a file "LPT:"

                          EMAIL from CIS's file. SAVE removes Email from
                          EasyPlex and stores it in PER area.
