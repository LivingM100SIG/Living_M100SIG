There are special programs, DIRACC & X-TEL, which (among other things) will
let you run BA programs with your Model 100 while on line.  This edited
message from Randy Hess tell how to do that WITHOUT any special software.
It also goves some cautions re modifying the software you run while on line,
to avoid returning to the M100 menu and breaking your connection.

How to Run a BA Program While ON-Line
-------------------------------------

1) POKE64270,73:POKE64271,108 will allow F7 to take you right to BASIC from
   TELCOM.

2) Then a CALL20806 from BASIC returns to TELCOM. I've run SORTHI and QKRCHK
   while On-Line using these routines with no problem.

[Once you are in Basic, you can type 'RUN "PROG"' for a BA program or
'RUNM "PROG"' for a CO program'.  See below for cautionary notes].

How to STAY On Line
-------------------

Perhaps it goes without saying, but be sure to change the MENU call in SORTHI
to a RETURN (C90000) before running it while On-Line or you'll hang up the
modem when you dump back to MENU.

[Similar changes are needed in other CO programs.  In BA programs, replace
any 'MENU' statements with 'END'].
