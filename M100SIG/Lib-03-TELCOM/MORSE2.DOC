
 MORSE.BA -- Morse code trainer for the M100/M102
 =================================================

      MORSE.BA is a Morse code teaching program designed to
 provide practice copy for anyone learning Morse to obtain an
 amateur radio operator's license.

 The program sends random 5-character strings of code, using
 the speaker of the M100, and displays the characters sent on
 the screen. Optionally, the characters sent may be captured
 in a file for later comparison.

 The program allows for full adjustability of the speed and
 spacing of the code sent, as well as the pitch of the audio
 tone. It supports all letters and numbers, and the
 punctuation and prosigns required by the FCC license test.

 The program is operated entirely by using the function keys,
 as described below:

 ACTION KEYS:
 ============

 Send (F4)
 ---------
 This key causes practice code to be sent. The normal mode of
 the program is to send 5 random characters, and then stop
 and display them on the screen, but a continuous send mode
 may be toggled using the Cont option described below.

 WPM (F2)
 --------
 This key allows you to set the words per minute sending
 speed to any value from 5 through 30 wpm. WPM is calculated
 based on the number of times the word "PARIS" can be sent in
 a minute. This convention is described in detail in the ARRL
 Handbook.

 Tone (F3)
 ---------
 This feature allows you to adjust the audio frequency of the
 speaker to your liking. It allows you to send a code test
 while making the adjustment, to check the way the code will
 sound.

 File (F1)
 ---------
 This key toggles the file capture feature of MORSE on and
 off.
 If no file is currently active, you are prompted for the
 name of a document file to capture the copy in. You do not
 need enter the '.DO' file extension. If the file you specify
 already exists, it will be written over.
 If a file is active when this key is pressed, the capture
 feature is stopped, and the file is closed.

 Test (F7)
 ---------
 This key sends the word "PARIS", using the current settings
 of WPM, Tone, and Spce.

 Exit (F8)
 ---------
 Ends the program, and returns you to the system menu. If any
 capture file is open, it is closed before leaving the
 program.


 OPTION KEYS:
 ============

 Cont (F5)
 ---------
 This option causes 5-character code groups to be generated
 and sent continuously when the option is on. The key remains
 active after the Send key (F4) is pressed, and pressing Cont
 during continuous sending cancels the option and stops the
 sending.
 (Note: When the timer is sounding the speaker, the interrupt
 generated by pressing the Cont function key is masked, so it
 may take a few tries to break into continuous sending. This
 is more of a problem at slow code speeds that at higher
 ones. Try to press the Cont key at the end of a 5 character
 group.)
 The normal status of this option is off, that is each press
 of the Send key sends 5 characters and halts.

 Spce (F6)
 ---------
 The Spce (space) option adjusts the overall formation and
 spacing of the Morse code characters. When this option is
 off, (the default), the spacing of the dots, dashes, and
 character and word pauses follows the conventions set down
 for international Morse code. This spacing is sometimes
 referred to as "Paris" convention spacing.
 With this option on, at WPM settings less than 13 wpm, the
 characters are formed and sent at 13wpm, but the spacing
 between characters and words is what it would be at the
 selected WPM.
 This is considered by some to be an aid to learning Morse,
 by accustoming your ear to the sound of the characters at a
 higher speed, but giving you the time you need at first to
 recognize each character sent. This method of sending is
 sometimes called "Farnsworth" spacing.
 At WPM of 13 or faster, this option has no effect.


 Notes on the use of Function Keys
 =================================

 At any given moment, on those function keys that are
 appropriate and may be used appear on the bottom line of the
 screen. Pressing a function key when it's label is blank
 results in no action.

 When an option is on, or a function is active, the key label
 appears in reverse video to remind you what the program is
 currently doing.

 Some final notes:
 =================

 The information used to create this program was obtained
 from the 1987 ARRL Handbook, available from:

      American Radio Relay League
      225 Main Street
      Newington, CT 06111, USA

 (These folks are the premier source for all information
 relating to getting a ham radio license).

 If any problems should present themselves while using
 MORSE.BA, please contact me via the M100SIG.

 Hope you enjoy the program...
