(Original & amended DVI versions by Terry Morgan 75735,1635; slightly revised, 
to conform to present CIS software, by Maddi Durholz 70466,1511.) This version 
revised & uploaded to M-100 SIG Data Library with permission of the copyright 
holder.

     SMART.DVI Ver.2.2 (revised) ties the Model 100 and DVI to Compuserve's (
CIS) Model 100 Special Interest Group (SIG) message base, & probably most 
others, at greatly reduced connect charges, since most time is spent offline. 
Instructions assume use of an 80 col. monitor, but mods. which may work for LCD
users are provided. The program may be run from MENUD.DVI (c)1984 Joel Orr & 
may be coordinated with COMLOG.DVI (c)1984 Maddi Durholz.

COMMERCIAL:
     New users: First things first. SMART.SIG, upon which SMART.DVI is based, 
cost Howard Benner a bunch to develop because most of the work on it took place
online. Yet SMART.DVI will save *you* money, since all of your "read, think & 
write" time is spent offline. Once you've spent some time with SMART.DVI, if 
you think it's worth something, Howard wouldn't mind if you sent him a fraction
of the money you saved. We're talking the freeware concept, & an intent, out of
enjoyment of this SIG & the 100, to let SIGgers determine SMART's worth.
Fair's fair, right? If, on the other hand, you don't think it's worth anything,
why don't you leave Howard some EMAIL (70235,1337) to let him know why. 

     New and old users: Maddi Durholz and Howard Benner if necessary, will 
support this version of SMART.DVI insofar as possible. If you have questions 
specific to the DVI/monitor, leave Maddi a SIG message & she'll try to help. (
For help with other SMART questions, please leave EMAIL for Howard.) Maddi uses
this version successfully with the present CIS software. If future CIS changes 
preclude its use, it will be withdrawn. If anyone is successfully using 
SMART.DVI Ver.2.4 & wishes to upload & support it, please contact Howard. 
     End of commercial. Here's what it does:

FUNCTIONS:
o  First, 2 columns of menu choices appear for your selection of CIS # to be 
autodialed, & choice of SIG (or Forum) & an exit point to 100's MENU; after 
keying selection (do not hit <ENTER>) a 3rd menu asks you for format (Quick, 
Headers, Write or Menu (100's)- elapsed time is displayed here, or shows 0's if
you've reset it or newly initializing. From here on SMART.DVI's actions are as 
follows:
o  Auto dial and redial if busy or no connect with the Model 100's internal 
modem. Works equally well with acoustic coupler. Also works with 300 or 1200 
baud external modem, but you'll have to program auto-dial code.
o  Auto logon (no menus) to this SIG & others (as long as your other choices 
allow the same permanently set options to be installed during new member signup
)via direct CIS phone number. Will not work with Tymnet or Telenet.
o  Check for marked messages (unread messages on the SIG addressed to you). If 
none skips next step.
o  Reads marked messages, saves them to a file & takes you offline (SMART.DVI 
writes the file contents to disk each time after logoff & kills contents when 
no longer needed) where you can print them & read, reread, reply, quit, delete 
or send a message to the writer or the addressee on a new subject; logs on 
again & sends messages you wrote (if any). All writing and optional printing is
done offline. See next section.
o  Scans messages since last time on & saves the headers to a file. "Quick" (
menu choice 1) does a thread-oriented scan (Maddi has tested somewhat but 
normally does not use this option); "Headers" (2) is chronological & displays 
time & date.
o  Resets CIS' last message counter. SMART.DVI, rather than doing a panic 
logoff when 100's memory is short, writes the I.DO file to disk; therefore you 
should keep a relatively empty disk in Drive 0 if you plan to read a lot of 
marked messages every few days.
o  Logs off and, offline, gives you the option of marking each message for 
retrieval in full or skipping (hit ENTER). If you don't mark any, clears files 
and ends program. Otherwise:
o  On again to read messages you marked, then off and to a routine similar to 
the one for RM's when you first logged on (read again, reply, delete, new 
message, etc.).
o  Keeps going until it completes the loop & there are no new messages on the 
SIG.
o  Logs elapsed time (on disk as "0:time.cis") & cumulates/displays same each 
time you logon. ( COMLOG.DVI in XA1 provides a patch to coordinate it with 
SMART.DVI's elapsed time log.) If your local CIS node "goes down" while 
redialing/relogging on at any point, the counter will not be affected; but if 
CIS itself hangs up, your counter is zapped (shows a minus amount of time!)- 
best thing is to estimate elapsed time & reset to 0 ala COMLOG.DVI patch (which
Maddi does after each SIG session anyway) or manually kill the "0:time.cis" 
data file which will reinitialize itself at the next use. There may also be a 
way of fixing up the "I.DO/O.DO" RAM files (but not "time.cis")to save the 
elapsed time in this situation.

WRITING OFFLINE:
     In addition, SMART.DVI can be used to create new messages to whoever about
whatever. Just pick "3" ("Write") on the menu instead of "1" or "2".
     When writing offline, limited backspacing over errors is OK using the BKSP
key, but you'll have to break the habit of hitting <ENTER> every 70 characters 
or so. SMART.DVI does this for you. Use <ENTER> if you like, to force a new 
line. Add <TAB> to indent a paragraph. <TAB> <ENTER> at the start of a line 
will send a blank line. <ENTER> <ENTER> (that is, <ENTER> at the start of a new
line) ends the message & "<S(P)N>" appears. Type in S for a public message, SP 
for private (if allowed- the 100 SIG does). Section number is optional. If one 
isn't typed after S or SP, the message will be sent to section 0. Even if a SIG
accepts SP's, it will reject and hang up on any that doesn't identify the 
recipient's ID number. You're always safe in replies, but otherwise be sure 
that you've included the recipient's number in the :To: " line. If not known, 
use S, not SP.
     Once you hit <ENTER>, one of two things will happen. If you've gotton to 
the Write routine while reading messages (for example, by hitting <r> to reply)
, you'll get a "...Standby..." followed by the same message. If to or from you,
you can delete it at this point, or use any of the other options. If you got 
there by selecting "Write" from SMART.DVI's menu, "To: " will appear. You can 
start a new message or hit <ENTER> to quit writing and send what you've 
written.

OPERATIONS:
     You don't have to remember everything above, since it's automatic & menu-
driven. Even if you <BREAK> the program or CIS "goes down", SMART.DVI, the next
time you run it, checks for its "I.DO and "O.DO files (in RAM- you'll see them 
in the MENU) &, if it finds them, picks up where it left off. (In the event you
cannot connect with your CIS node(s) or the CIS/SIG "goes down" while you are 
online with SMART.DVI, just <BREAK> the program, type GOTO 99 and then hit F8 
to commence disconnect in the usual way; then, if necessary, logon the CIS way 
& type OFF to effect proper logoff.) But here's what you *do* need:

o  Memory.  When running SMART.DVI it writes the "I.DO" RAM file to disk each 
time RAM fills up (it eventually kills the RAM & disk files). Header or message
scroll will pause a minute or 2 & then scroll recommences. Free disk bytes 
needed depends on your length of absence/number of marked messages on the SIG 
message base. After each use, SMART.DVI resets your SIG counter to the number 
of the high message, giving you a clean slate.
o  Speed.  Messages offline will move considerably faster than online. Bad 
news: you can't use F1 to read the previous screen when reading offline. Good 
news: you can use <Pause> to stop & restart the scroll. Better news: you can 
hit "n" (the "agai<n>" prompt) to rescroll the entire message.
o  Patience.  SMART.DVI is as fast as CIS will allow. If CIS is 
sssslllooowwwww, so will SMART.DVI be, while online. Unless you get repeated 
hangups of more than 2 minutes at exactly the same spot, the problem is CIS. 
The place a hangup is most likely is right after SMART.DVI scans new messages. 
CIS doesn't like you jumping on & off in a hurry, so SIG software does not 
normally update the less message counter unless you spend time reading messages
in sequence. To reset CIS' counter, SMART.DVI executes a ctl P logoff, but, 
mercifully doesn't show it on your screen. This may take several seconds, while
you watch " ... standby ..." slowly add "."'s & beep back at you. You should 
get a series of dots, then ":T".
o  The options are, for the most part, self-explanatory. Scanning headers 
offline prompts you for <m> e<x>it or <Enter> ("Header") or for read <m>essage 
- message and nn <r>eplies ("Quick").
   m= mark this message for retrieval
   r= ("Quick" only) mark message & the rest of the thread going forward.
   x= quit
  <Enter>= skip to next message.
While reading messages offline, the prompt line is "<u>a <r>e <p>t e<x>it <a>
drse agai<n>," with <d>ele instead of e<x>it if the message is to or from you &
contains your ID number. To skip the next message, hit <Enter>. Otherwise,
  u= send a message to the person who wrote this, but with a new subject;
  r=reply to this message;
  p=line print this message;
  d= delete this message (see above);
  a= send a new message to the person this was addressed to;
  x= quit. Not interested in reading any more flagged messages (but high 
message counter has been reset so you don't get a second chance)
  n= rescroll this message.
  IMPORTANT: Use lower case letters only in answering all prompts. Caps or any 
other unacceptable letter will be treated as an <n> and rescroll.
o   Use any F key (1-8) to jump to TELCOM, still online. If you see the 
familiar F-Key TELCOM definitions on the bottom line, you're out of SMART.DVI &
on standard TELCOM.
o   The ABSOLUTE, WORST, MOST COSTLY thing that can happen is that you'll lose 
touch with CIS' computer & be charged for a few extra minutes (usually 
avoidable by a <BREAK>, GOTO 99, F8, & disconnect plus you could logon again 
the CIS way & type OFF).

INITIALIZING:
  Here's how to get it going. The crucial lines are 0 and 99. You'll have to 
"personalize" them & set options permanently for the M-100 SIG & up to four 
other SMART.DVI- compatible SIGS. By compatible, we mean that provide user 
options settings similar to the M-100 SIG. You may also need to change some CIS
options settings as described below.
  First download SMART.DVI from XA1 in the usual way. Edit line 0 so that PW 
equals your password. (This is used only for the logon.) Your password should 
_not_ contain "=" or "?". (If you want to give a copy of SMART.DVI to a friend,
change PW in line 0 back to "pass*word" & leave the copyright notice intact.) 
If you do not use an 80 col. monitor, but the M-100's LCD display, change the 
variable WW in line 0 from 80 to 40 & the PRINT@ statement in lines 16, 17, and
45 from 24 to 7.
  Next, go to line 99, which must be changed to include the CIS phone numbers 
you'll be using to log on. There's room for three, with or without prefixes 
such as "9=" from the office or area codes for long distance. (There may be a 
few small areas in the U.S. which now, thanks to divestiture, have equipment 
which may be incompatible with this version of SMART.DVI (like acting as if you
are dialing a long distance "1" when you are not, & rejecting your call)- if so
we cannot help you.) Follow the format in the line now, entering up to three 
telephone numbers, each followed by a comma. Garbage numbers such as the "555-
1212" provided are mandatory for slots not used, since items following the 
phone numbers must be exactly where they are now.
   The rest of line 99 can be changed to reflect your other choice of SIGs, as 
long as their SIG options can be set permanently as described below. So line 99
format is SIG,page,SIG,page... etc. If you have fewer than 5 SIG choices, leave
the dummies in the unused slots as is.

SETTING CIS AND SIG OPTIONS:
   Now that the program is perfect, go online to CIS the old way. G CIS-9 & 
view terminal parameters to be sure blank lines are sent. (These are filtered 
out by SMART.DVI during its <p>rint operations but needed in the files.) If you
need to reset, go back to CIS-9 & select menu option to change terminal 
parameters (5); on next menu select blank lines (9) & on the next menu select 
send blank lines (2). Then follow the remaining menus to make the change 
permanent.
   Next, go to the SIG the old way (GO PCS-154). At the "Function: " prompt, 
type OP. In response to the User Options Menu, first check/change the items to 
be sure line length shown in [] is 79 (probably 40 for LCD users), prompt 
character is ^B (that's cap 6 B), editor is SED & default sub-topic is 0. Then 
hit H for Help & follow instructions to set MEN to [no], BR to [yes], ST to [
yes], TWM to [no] and RMS to [no]; then be sure to make these options permanent
(P) & recheck your settings. You can, when necessary, change any option(s) 
temporarily for 1 session (change it & don't hit P); for example, if you need 
to use the Filge editor. But for most purposes (all of Maddi's) these settings 
will do. 

ERRORS, EDITING:
   If you plan to do any editing of the program, REM the ONERROR code in line 
49 during debugging. Otherwise, you'll get misleading error messages.
   If there are some features you won't be using, portions of the code can be 
deleted. If you don't need the external/acoustic modem feature, delete lines 39
-41, & replace "300 modem, "1200 modem", and "Acou/Dial" in DATA line 99 with 
blanks enclosed in quotes (" "), each separated by a comma. If you plan to scan
only by headers (no "Quick"), delete lines 43-45 & replace "Quick" in line 14 
with " ".
