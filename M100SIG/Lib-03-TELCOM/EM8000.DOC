            The files, EM8001.DOC through EM8008.DOC, contain the complete
        documentation for EM8SIG.400. They replace the files EM8SIG.DC1-DC6,
        EM8TIP.001 - .002, and PROFLE.CIS.
        
            Download each file, one at a time and save them to tape or disk.
        Then print each file in order, EM8001-EM8008. When you have finished
        you will have a 37 page, indexed, fully illustrated and comprehensive
        instruction booklet for the proper operation and enjoyment of
        EM8SIG.400.
        
            It should be noted that neither Stan Wong nor I have a Chipmunk,
        a DVI, or RAM +. We also do not use the cups to contact CIS.
        Therefore, we are unfamiliar with their operations relative to this
        program. To preserve what information there was for them we simply
        transferred Marvin's notes into this new documentation. If you use
        any of these add-on's with EM8SIG and run into any trouble, PLEASE
        let us know so we can work with you on a possible solution to the
        problem and correct the documentation.
        
        We hope you enjoy the program.
