	I just learned (the hard way) that the direct connect cable for the 100
does *not* get along with RJ-14 phone jacks. These are the jacks that are used
with the various phones and accesories that let you get two phone lines on a
"standard" phone jack.
	All phone jacks carry line one on the red & green pair of wires. RJ-11
jacks don't have any specific use for the yellow & black pair. They can be used
for power to phone dial lights and the like, or more often the yellow wire is
grounded and the black wire is left unconnected.
	RJ-14 jacks use the yellow & black pair to carry a second phone line.
Normally you can plug anything you would plug into an RJ-11 (normal) jack into
an RJ-14. You'd just get line one. But since line 2 is carried on the yellow &
black wires, the m100 cable will cause *intermittent* problems on line 2!!
	The cable doesn't use the yellow & black wires. BUT THEY ARE PARTIALLY
STRIPPED. If the bare ends of these wires touch *ANYTHING* inside the
connector, they will cause static, loss of volume and other problems on the
second line. And since there is about an inch of wire, they can move easily
(say you 'bump' the 100...).
        The solution is to open the connector (the 8-pin plug) and either trim
the yellow and black wires back to the silver and beige 'jackets', or solder
the two yellow wires together, solder the two black wires together, and wrap
the junction in insulation.

	There is yet another kind of jack (RJ-45) that carries *three* lines
but that is all the info I have on it. Since the 100 cable doesn't have wires
where the third line connects, it won't cause problems on line 3. But it will still cause trouble on line 2.

	Finally, some external modems (USR for one) will take line 2 "off hook"
while you are using them on line 1! This results in all kinds of trouble. (just
as if you picked up the reciever and set it on the table next to the phone)

	A good, cheap solution to potential problems is a "3-way, 2-line" jack
such as Radio Shack's 279-402 ($6.95). This carries *only* the two wires needed
for line 1 on one jack, the two for line 2 on another and all four wires on the
third.
