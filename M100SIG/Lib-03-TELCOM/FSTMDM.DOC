FASTMODEM - A software modem speed up for the Model 100 : Bob Scott 
73125,1437
This file describes the use of FSTMDM.100, a program which allows you to 
speed up the M100 modem by 50% to 450 baud.  Some CIS direct dial numbers 
support this rate (use GO PHONES to check), however it is NOT supported by 
TeleNet or TYMNET.  Of course, two M100's can use this rate to communicate 
with each other over a dialup circuit.
Cautions:
This program nastily grabs and clears high memory.  It also reassigns the 
TELCOM f7 key to give you a readout of bytes free while you're online.  f6 
is reset as described below.  This program CANNOT be used with an autologin
macro of any type (yet).  If you can put up with these "features", it 
really does speed up the internal modem.
Theory:
The M100 modem can be pushed to as much as 600 baud over standard phone 
lines.  Since CIS thoughtfully supports 450 baud, it is possible to 
communicate at that faster rate with an M100. The program FASTMDM loads a 
machine language routine above HIMEM and assigns the online TELCOM function
key F6 to call the routine.  When executed, the M/L program resets the 
internal baud rate generator to 450 baud.  Since TELCOM sets the rate to 
300 when it shifts to online mode, you must press F6 after going online, 
but BEFORE typing anything(hence the restriction on login macros).  If you 
type anything before pressing F6, CIS will sense that you are at 300 baud, 
and will not let you change to 450.
Use:
  Clear any machine language programs out of high memory.  Place the cursor
over FASTMDM and press RETURN.  You will see the screen flash "Installing 
450 bps" then get the menu back.  You may now enter TELCOM and dial CIS 
manually, or with a number from ADRS.DO, just so long as it is followed by 
only a "<>" (remember, NO login strings!).  After you get connected, 
indicated by the label line chaning to the online mode ("Up Down" etc.) and
BEFORE typing anything press F6.  You'll hear a beep, which indicates that 
you are in 450 baud mode. You can then hit "ENTER", login and enjoy.
After you finish your TELCOM session, you can remove the machine language 
routine, and free up high memory for other uses, by again executing FSTMDM 
from the main menu.  You'll see the legend "Removing 450 bps.." and be 
returned to the main menu.  (The TELCOM F6 key will be set to a CLEAR 
SCREEN function by the program when it deinstalls).

Reference:
  For you hackers, the M/L routine is:
     DI
     PUSH PSW
     MVI A,85
     OUT 188
     MVI A,65
     OUT 189
     MVI A,195
     OUT 184
     CALL 16937
     POP PSW
     EI
     RET
