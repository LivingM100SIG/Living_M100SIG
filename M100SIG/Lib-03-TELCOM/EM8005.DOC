            YOUR PRINTER IS **CONNECTED** AND TURNED **ON** OR ELSE YOU COULD
            LOSE -=EVERYTHING=- !!!!! EM8SIG does not check to see if you
            have done this. It just assumes you know what you are doing.

            After checking with EasyPlex, EM8SIG transmits a "GO M100SIG"
        command. As soon as CIS makes the connection, you will see the
        program automatically set up its required Forum options. No permanent
        changes are made to user selected options. The program will then
        "Quick Scan" all message headers of messages uploaded to the forum
        since you last checked in. It will download these to either your
        printer, "LPT:", or "HDRSIG.DO", whichever you have chosen as the
        download path. If you have chosen "HDRSIG.DO" and the file does not
        exist in RAM, EM8SIG will establish it. Next EM8SIG checks for all
        messages addressed to you. It does this by looking for your ID in the
        "To:" field of each message on the forum. That is why including the
        "ID" is so important. If it is not there you may never see the
        message unless you happen to choose to read it because of its title.
        If any messages are found, they will be downloaded to either your
        printer, "LPT:", or "NEWSIG.DO", and as before, if you have chosen
        "NEWSIG.DO" and the file is not in RAM, EM8SIG will establish it.
        Lastly, EM8SIG will reset the high message counter so it will know
        where to begin the next time, and log-off of CIS. In other words it
        will hang-up the phone.

            All of the above will happen very quickly, a lot faster than you
        could have done it manually. And now you can spend your time off-line
        reviewing your messages and checking for other messages that might be
        of interest to you.


                                      CMDSIG.DO

            CMDSIG.DO is another file you must set up manually. It will
        contain your REAd commands when you log back on as well as other
        forum commands you might choose to use.



            The format for reading individual messages is "REA NUM:n" without
        the quotes of course and where "n" is the number of the message you
        want to read.

            The format for reading a thread is "REA THR NUM:n". A "thread" is
        a number of messages on the same subject. Sometimes it is a dialogue
        between two people. Other times others will jump in with ideas and/or
        comments. For this latter reason, a thread can take off in many
        directions but the one common denominator is that all the messages
        have the same title.

            Let's assume after reviewing your printout or file of message
        headers you decide you would like to read message number 180194.
        Enter TEXT by placing the curser over TEXT on the main menu. When
        asked for the file name, type CMDSIG and press enter. Now type REA
        NUM:180194 and press enter. The next time you run EM8SIG, it will
        look for CMDSIG.DO right after it enters the forum and execute the
        REAd command. It will copy message 180194 to your printer or
        NEWSIG.DO file just as it did when there were messages addressed to
        you. If you had wanted to read "thread" number 146192, you would have
        given the command, REA THR NUM:146192. In this case, all messages in
        the thread beginning with that message number and continuing to the
        end of the thread would be downloaded to your printer or NEWSIG.DO.

            I have found that it is possible to put forum commands in CMDSIG
        and they will work as if you had manually typed them in, somewhat
        similar to a macro. The two commands I have experimented with are
        "ANN;1" which give you the announcements at the beginning of the
        forum at log on, and "DES;2;1" which gives you the uploads to the
        libraries for the past 7 days. It is possible to use both of these
        commands at the same time by using the following format thanks to
        Tony Anderson: ANN;1; ; ;DES;2;1; ; ; NOTE: each command is followed
        by the sequence ";<space>;<space>;". Using this arrangement it is
        possible to intermix these commands into REA's (or read individual
        messages), and REA THR's (or read threads).

            When using REA's, it is possible to connect several REA's
        together such as "REA NUM:134890;REA NUM:134987;REA NUM:134990;REA
        NUM:135025". REA THR's should be formatted "REA THR NUM:146921;REA
        THR NUM:149361". It is possible to intermix REA NUM's and REA THR
        NUM's such as "REA NUM:134904;REA NUM:134987;REA THR NUM:146921;REA
        NUM:234990;REA NUM:135025;REA THR NUM:149361". It is now possible to
        also intermix the ANN;1 and DES;2;1 commands, or any other forum
        command you wish to use, as long as you end each of the forum
        commands with the ; ; ;. Such as "ANN;1; ; ;REA NUM:134904;REA
        NUM:134987;REA THR NUM:146921;REA NUM:234990;REA NUM:135025;REA THR
        NUM:149361;DES;2;1; ; ;

            I have been able to chain up to eight REA commands successfully
        this way. Beyond that I get a beep and everything else is ignored.
        This has nothing to do with program, but is a CIS line length
        limitation.


                                    SECOND LOG-ON


            After you have selected the messages or threads you wish to
        review, again start up EM8SIG. Now, you have already looked at the
        Mail, and you have already downloaded the message headers. All you
        want to do now is read the messages you have placed in COMMAND.DOC.
        So this time press F6. You will once again see the program log-on as
        before only this time there will not be a detour through EasyPlex but
        a direct jump to M100SIG or the forum of choice. EM8SIG will search
        out the message(s) as directed, download them and then log-off.





                                       19


        


             Before going any further, check CMDSIG.DO again. You will notice
        that all your commands are now gone and in their place is the word
        "Sent ". This is important because if EM8SIG checks CMDSIG.DO and
        sees that word, it will ignore anything following it and treat the
        file as if it does not exist. Therefore, the next time you put
        commands into CMDSIG.DO you -must- delete the word "Sent ".

                              MESSAGE COMPOSE ROUTINES


            EM8SIG.400 permits the automatic sending of both Email and Forum
        messages that have been composed off-line as well as files previously
        uploaded to the user's CIS PER file area. The user does not have to
        pay attention to line lengths or message lengths. The line length is
        taken care of automatically and the message length will trigger a
        warning message as you approach the size limitations. The messages
        can be composed manually in a TEXT file if the user desires. However
        we -strongly- recommend the use of the MESSAGE COMPOSE subroutine
        (F7) as this will insure correct message formats. Each message is
        separated in the file by a <GRPH f> (hold down GRPH while pressing f
        and follow it with a <CR>). The <GRPH f> must be on a line by itself
        at the left of the page. The file must be ended with an end of file
        (EOF) symbol or left facing arrow. If you use the F7 key and the
        MESSAGE COMPOSE routine you will not have to worry about this. It
        will all be done automatically.

        NOTE: NO <CR>'s should be used inside the messages' text. <CR>'s
        should be used ONLY to end and separate paragraphs.

            Messages are ended by successive <CR>'s. What happens next
        depends on whether you are in the Email or Forum compose routine.


                            EMAIL MESSAGE COMPOSE ROUTINE


            Now, let's assume that when you made the swing through EasyPlex a
        while ago, there was a letter there for you. After reading it
        off-line, you decide to answer it. Start up EM8SIG again and when you
        reach the first screen press F7. You will see the following screen.

                      ________________________________________
                     |            COMPOSE MESSAGES            |
                     |                                        |

                     |                                        |
                     |                                        |
                     |________________________________________|

            Since you are going to send an Email message press "E". You will
        then see the question, "Add to existing messages?", appear in the
        above screen. Press "N" for "NO" and the screen will clear showing
        only a "To:" in the upper left hand corner of the screen. The name
        and ID of the person you are writing to should already be in your PIN
        file. You may identify this person by first or last name, or by ID or
        any portion thereof. Then press <ENTER>. The program will look up the
        name and ID and enter it into the message file MAIL.DO. If the file
        does not already exist, EM8SIG will create it.
