               AN EASIER WAY FOR TWO MODEL 100S TO COMMUNICATE

You can send files from one Model 100 to another by modem directly from BASIC 
or TEXT without using the TELCOM program.  You can also use this way to send 
files to other computers from TEXT, but not from BASIC, since different BASICs 
use different tokens.

ADVANTAGES:  From BASIC you can send a program without converting it to an 
ASCII document file and back again at the receiving end, which is necessary 
with TELCOM.  It also switches automatically from voice to BASIC or TEXT and 
back again to voice communication.

DISADVANTAGE:  Neither screen shows what is transmitted.  You can, however, 
calculate how long transmission will take.  Since 300 baud equals approximately
30 characters per second, an 1800-byte file takes about a minute.

SET UP:  Connect the Model 100s to phone lines and call your friend.  Be sure 
the receiving Model 100 has enough free memory for the file.  Then set the 
switches on the left side so one modem is on "Orig" and the other on "Ans" and 
both are set to "Dir".

If the Model 100s are in the same room, it's easy to connect them without using
either a telephone line or an RS-232 cable and null modem adapter.  Simply 
connect the beige line of the modem cable (26-1410) on each Model 100 with the 
in-line coupler that comes with the modem cable and is usually used to connect 
your telephone to the silver line.

SENDING A BASIC PROGRAM:  The sender loads the program he wants to send.  Then 
he hits the <F3> key so that the last line on the screen reads:  Save "

Then type the following--without hitting <Enter> just yet:  MDM:8n1e

Meanwhile the recipient also loads BASIC.  At the "ok" prompt hit the <F2> key 
so the screen reads:  Load "

With hitting <Enter> yet type:  MDM:8n1e

Be sure to use a colon, not a semi-colon.  The recipient must hit <Enter> 
before the sender does.  Don't hang up the phone, so that you can talk again 
after you transmit the program.  You'll know when you're through sending both 
by seeing the "ok" prompt return to the screen and by hearing the phone line 
clear.  The recipient saves the file with <F3>.

SENDING A TEXT FILE:  The sender loads the text file he wants to send and hits 
the <F3> key so that the last line on the screen reads:  Save to "

Then the sender types the following--without hitting <Enter> yet:  MDM:8n1e

The recipient creates a TEXT file with a blank screen.  He hits the <F2> key so
that the screen reads:  Load from:

Without hitting <Enter> yet, he types:  MDM:8n1e

Be sure to use a colon, not a semi-colon.  The recipient must hit <Enter> 
before the sender.  Don't hang up the phone.  When the cursor comes back to the
screen and the phone line clears you can talk again.  The recipient save the 
file with <F3>.

USING TELCOM:  You can, of course, also send a TEXT file--but not a BASIC 
program--from TELCOM.  Chapter 11 of the Owner's Manual tells how, except for 
this:  (1) Like in TEXT and BASIC you can go from voice to data communication, 
but it is a bit more complicated.  You both hit the <F4> Term key; the receiver
gets ready to download first with <F2>, and the sender uploads with <F3>;  (2) 
Unlike in TEXT and BASIC you do not automatically go back to voice 
communication after you send the file.  But if you both use the <F8> key, you 
can.  (3) The receiving screen shows the file being transmitted, but the 
sending screen does not.  (4) When in the Terminal mode you can also type (or 
compose) to the other computer, but you need to use Ctrl-J to get a line feed.

OTHER INFORMATION:  Thanks to Dave Atkinson of Lompoc, CA, whose eagle eye saw 
the significance of a line in the Owner's Manual which set this whole thing off
(open "MDM:7I1D" on page 199).  Thanks too for input from C. Davey Utter, 
Dennis Thomas, and Asysop Tony Anderson, all of this SIG.  I published a 
preliminary draft of this idea in Portable 100, December 1984, pp. 22-23.
