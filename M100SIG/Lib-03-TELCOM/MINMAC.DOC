MINMAC.DOC

   MINMAC.100 is a one-liner sheepishly dubbed a "mini-MACRO" -- because it 
allows you to send a customized command string from the M100 to a host 
computer, with a single keystroke in TELCOM.
   The program loads your command (mine is "DISPLAY<CR>", as listed) into 
M100's paste buffer, re-sets com status, then takes you into TELCOM.
   I have expanded the listing and added remarks for clarity in the MINMAC.100 
file.  If you take out the REM lines and combine the intent of lines 50 and 70,
the one-line program looks like this:

1 FORN!=1TO9:POKE-1626+N!,ASC(MID$("PASTA DO"+CHR$(0),N!))
:NEXT:CLEAR:OPEN"PASTA"FORAPPENDAS1:PRINT#1,"DISPLAY"+CHR$(13)
:CLOSE:FORN!=1TO5:POKE63066+N!,ASC(MID$("M7I1E",N!)):NEXT:CALL20806

   I wrote this because my host computer at work needs a "DISPLAY <CR>" to send
a screenful of information to the M100.  I got tired of typing that.  Now I 
just hit the PASTE key, sip a beer, and let the machines do the work.
   For use on Compuserve, you could change the string to "GO PCS154 <CR>" to 
get into the M100 SIG, for example.
   Or CHR$(16)+CHR$(13) would send <CTRL><P>+<CR>, allowing you to quit reading
a SIG message in mid-stream and call up the next message.
   Putting CHR$(17) -- a <CTRL><Q> -- into the command string would let you 
toggle between the PAUSE and PASTE keys to turn the input stream off and on.  (
A bonus for us slow readers at 300 baud; untested at higher speeds.)
   Note that the program re-names the paste buffer as PASTA.DO.  You should 
make up another name (lines 20 and 60) if you keep lots of Italian recipes in 
the M100.  Accidentally KILLing or OPENing the buffer for OUTPUT, under any 
name, is probably going to take your machine to the ice-cream parlor.
   Starting at line 90, MINMAC borrows a tip from Tony Anderson's POKES.100 
file in DL8 and (re-)sets TELCOM's status to "M7I1E".  That's in deference to 
my disc system, which likes to change things when I'm not looking.  People 
without this problem can eliminate lines 90 to 110.
   On the other hand, if you have frequent cold starts and want to be sure your
dialing rate is set to 20 pps, you can change line 90 to FORN!+1TO8 and stick 
"M7I1E,20",N! between the parens in line 100.
   For the really brave, the final CALL in the program can be changed to 21067 
-- which will not only put you in TELCOM, but also find and display the first 
item in the ADRS.DO file.  Then you can start the calling sequence with a mere 
<CR>.    (I haven't seen this CALL documented anywhere, but so far it hasn't 
crashed my 32K few-frills machine.
   And for those who use program XXXXX.BA instead of TELCOM, you can ask MINMAC
to create your command string and automatically enter your com program by 
replacing the CALL in line 120 with a RUN"XXXXX.BA".  (Note: if your com 
program uses a CLEAR statement of any kind, it will void the paste buffer.  You
may be able to move the CLEAR instruction into MINMAC, delete it from the com 
program, and run the two sequentially.)
   A final note on how I use this program.  With Rick Perry's CHANGE.BA in DL7,
I un-crowd the menu by making  TELCOM invisible.  (Ditto for ADRS.DO and some 
other stuff.)  Then, using CHANGE.BA's re-name feature, I name MINMAC.BA as T. 
And when prompted for an extension, I hit the space-bar twice and <CR> once.  
Suddenly MINMAC has become, simply, T -- which I also make invisible.  At the 
menu, I type T,<CR>, and I'm in TELCOM with MINMAC's command string loaded and 
ready to go.
