                                      program.


               This program is designed to quickly and efficiently transfer
          text files between a Radio Shack Model 100/102 laptop computer
          and an IBM or Sanyo MBC-555 computer.  (There are two versions of
          this program, one which runs on an IBM PC or true compatible, and
          another which runs on the Sanyo MBC-555.)  In addition to
          transferring files between the two computers, this program will
          convert the text files to Word Perfect, WordStar, standard Ascii,
          or unformatted format when transferring from the Model 100/102 to
          the IBM/Sanyo.  The advantage of this is that the ability to edit
          and reformat paragraphs is retained when moving from the laptop
          to the IBM/Sanyo.  (For those more technically minded, the
          transfer process retains the distinction between "hard" and
          "soft" carriage returns.)  In addition, it is possible to change
          the right margin during the transfer process to whatever value is
          desired.  Since the program runs at 9600 baud, it is also faster
          than most other methods for transferring text files between the
          two machines.
               In order to use this program, you will need a Sanyo or IBM
          and a Radio Shack Model 100 or 102 laptop.  (The Kyocera laptop
          also works beautifully.  I do not know if the Tandy Model 200
          will work properly or not, but I think that it might.  I also do
          not know if the NEC 8201 or 8401 will work.  If anyone tries this
          program and finds out, let me know.)  You will also need a null
          modem cable to connect the two machines.  (For the technically
          minded, this means that pins 2 and 3 have to be crossed.  I have
          used this program successfully with only pins 2 and 3 crossed,
          and with pin 7 (ground) runs straight through.  Thus you may only
          need a cable with three wires.  For greater security, and a more
          versatile null modem cable, you will want to run pin 1 straight
          through, and cross pins 4 and 5.  Pin 6 on each side should cross
          to both pin 8 and 20 on the other side.  This is a "full-
          handshake" null modem cable.)

               The operation of the program is, I hope, very simple.  Call
          up the program by typing "transfer" and pressing the carriage
          return key (CR).  A menu will appear which gives you a number of
          options:
               -Download a file from the Model 100 to this computer
               -Upload a file from this computer to the model 100
               -List the directory
               -File utilities
               -Change the Word Processing format used
               -Change the right margin
          A discussion of each of these options follows.





                                          1



          -Download a file from the Model 100 to this computer
               This is probably the function you will use the most.  It is
          used from transferring files from the laptop to the IBM/Sanyo. 
          When you press "D", you will prompted for a name for the file. 
          This is the name by which the file will be called on the
          IBM/Sanyo, and does not need to be the same as the file's name on
          the laptop (although using the same name can sometimes avoid
          confusion later.)  If that file already exists, you will be asked
          whether it is OK to delete the old file.  If you answer "N" here,
          you be prompted for another file name.
               After entering the file name, the program will instruct you
          regarding your action on the laptop.  Follw these directions, and
          the program will inform you of its rogress.
               If the program does not receive any characters from the
          laptop in about 1 minute, it will inform you, and ask if it
          should wait (W) or abort(A).  If you press "W", the program will
          wait another minute.  If you press "A", you will be returned to
          DOS.  If you get this message, either your cable is not properly
          wired, or you have not entered COM:88N1E at the "Save to:" prompt
          on the Model 100/102.
               During the file transfer itself, pressing the break key will
          abort the transfer process, and return you to DOS.
               After the file has been received in the IBM/Sanyo, it must
          be reformatted in memory and written to disk.  This can take a
          little bit, so don't worry if the response isn't instantaneous.

          -Upload from the IBM/Sanyo to the laptop
               When you press "U", you will prompted as to the action you
          should take on both the IBM/Sanyo and the laptop.  Follow these
          direction precisely.  The characters will appear on the laptop as
          they are being transferred.  When the file is finished
          transferring, you will need to press function #2 on the laptop to
          save the file there.
               The upload procedure tries to filter out all special
          formatting characters, but may miss some.  Perhaps a future
          version of this program will do a better job of this.  The
          procedure will transfer ascii files perfectly.

          -List the files directory.
               After pressing "L", you will see an Options prompt. 
          Usually, you will want to simply press the carriage return here. 
          Then you will prompted for a directory mask.  Simply pressing
          return will give a list of the files in the current directory. 
          You can optionally list a path to another directory, or use wild
          cards like *.TXT to list only certain files.

          -File Utilities
               This is simply a collection of functions to help you manage
          files.  You can make a new directory, change directories, find
          out what drive you are logged on to, find out the free space on a
          drive, or delete a file.  These procedures should be relatively
          self-explanatory.

                                          2



          -Change the Word processing format used.
               This program will convert laptop text files to WordStar,
          Word Perfect, standard ascii or unformatted files.  The format
          listed at "Currently:" is the format which will be used when you
          use the upload or download procedures.  The format listed at
          "Default: " is the format which will automatically be used
          whenever you start the program, unless you call the "Change"
          procedure to change it.  When you call this option, you will
          first be prompted for the new format to use.  Then you will be
          asked if you want to make this the default format.  If you answer
          yes, the TRANSFER.COM file will be altered so that the new format
          always comes up as the default.  If you answer no to the
          question, the new format will be used in that particular file
          transfer session, until you exit TRANSFER, or until you call the
          change procedure again, but the default format will remain what
          it was before.  You should set the default format to whatever
          Word processing program you use.  Then, under normal
          circumstances, you should never have to call the "Change"
          procedure.
               A few words of explanation about the difference between the
          standard ascii option and the "unmodified" option are in order. 
          The standard ascii option will filter out all non-standard
          control sequences, and all characters with the high bit set.  It
          will also format the lines to the right margin length.  When the
          "unmodified" option is used, the file is transferred directly
          from one computer to the other with no formatting or modification
          at all.  This option may enable some other word processors to use
          files from the Mod100 and still preserve the distinction between
          hard and soft carriage returns.  Note, however, that this will
          not work well for transfer of binary files, since the program
          stops transfer whenever the EOF character (ascii #26) is
          encountered, which may occur before the end of a binary file.
               There are several additional improvements added to the Word
          Perfect formatting option.  This option will now convert all the
          foreign language characters which are displayed on the Mod100
          with the "graph" and "code" keys to proper IBM display in
          WordPerfect when transferring to the IBM.  (It will not, as yet,
          do the same conversion when moving from the IBM to the Mod100.) 
          In addition, it will also enable you to enter boldface and
          underlining commands on the Mod100 and transfer those codes to
          the IBM when transferring the file.  To underline a sentence,
          place a control-U (press control-p and then control-U) before the
          material you wish to underline, and then another control-U after
          that material.  Everything between the two control-U's will be
          underlined in WordPerfect when the file is transferred.  To do
          boldfacing, simply use the same procedure, except using a
          control-B rather than a control-U.

          -Right Margin change.
               This procedure works similarly to the format change
          procedure, using both a current setting and a default setting. 
          Set the default setting to whatever length line you normally use. 

                                          3



          Then, you can change it temporarily whenever needed by calling
          this procedure, and answering no to the question about making the
          new setting the default.  Both the default and the current
          setting can be changed as often as desired.
               Note that this option is not listed when the "unmodified"
          format is selected, since the "unmodified" format does not format
          the right margin.

          Credits:
               This program is the result of the labors of several
          different people who have been gracious enough to contribute
          their efforts to the public domain.  The routines for the serial
          port were written by Philip Burns for the IBM and Wayne Conrad
          for the Sanyo.  The file utilities were written mainly by Michael
          A. Covington.  The rest of the program was written by Jim
          Brownson.  I would welcome feedback from your use of the program. 
          I can be reached on Compuserve #73170-726, or at 207 Loetscher
          Place, #5B, Princeton, N.J.  08540.  This program was written and
          compiled in Turbo Pascal version 3.02A.  If you would like the
          source code, send me $10.00 to cover postage and handling, and I
          will send it to you.  Feel free to copy this program and share it
          with friends, but do not alter either the program or this
          documentation file.  Please include the documentation file when
          you share the program.
