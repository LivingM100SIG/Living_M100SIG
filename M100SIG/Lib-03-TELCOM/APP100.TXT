Talking to the Apple with the TRS-100:
    I am using the CCS 7710 serial card in slot 4 of the Apple, and AE-Pro.
 I have set up the terminal s/w (ASCII Express the Professional) as follows:
 Auto disconnect Off
 Emulation Off
 Baud 300 works, but is buggy. The bugs go away at 1200 baud!  <Strange!!>
 Data word 7 bits even parity, 1 stop bit  XON/XOFF enabled.
Permanent carrier
 Make sure that the baud switch on the CCS card is set correctly for the 
desired baud rate.
 I boot AE and am placed in Terminal mode. I have the 100 in Originate mode.
 I hit ^Q on the Apple and + to put the Apple in Remote Mote. (This is covered
in the AE documentation under Unattended Operation).  At that point, from the
100, I can send a D to the apple to see the directory.
 A C will tell the apple to copy the file, and should be followed by the
filename you wish to send. To end the file send two ^Cs and the file will
be saved to disk.
 A V will ask for the file name to be viewed and should be followed by the
filename. This, of course will terminate itself on the Apple. To save the
file on the 100, you should hit the down function key again.
 TRS set for 57I1E,10  RS-232 straight through! (no Null modem No special
cables !) 
 AE-Pro runs in terminal mode: Note unattended operation section of documents.
TRS in Originate mode. Works regardless of status of Acoustic Cup / direct
switch on the TRS-100!
