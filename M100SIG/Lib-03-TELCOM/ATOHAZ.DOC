	This program will dial a number from your ADRS.DO file (or other
specified file) using a Hayes compatible modem at 300, 1200 or 2400 bps. If it
does not get a valid carrier, it will re-dial until it does get a valid carrier
or it is manually interrupted. If it does get a valid carrier, it will execute
the autolog string associated with that number (if any) and then go into
TELCOM's TERM mode.

			Selecting a dialing File
	At the "Find:" prompt if you enter "Files" (no quotes!) you will be
prompted for a file (prompt "File:") otherwise ADRS.DO will be used. If you
haven't changed your function key definitions this may be done by pressin the
F1 key. Otherwise you will have to enter the word by hand. Case doesn't matter.
FILES, files, FiLEs, etc will all work.
	The selected file will be used until you exit the program or
successfully connect with a call.
	The filename may be a disk file if you have a DVI, or Chipmunk. If you
have a TD1 or TD2 you will need an operating system that lets you read disk
files from BASIC to us a disk file as the dialing file.

			Selecting a number to dial.
	At the "Find:" prompt enter the name to search for. The first matching
name will be displayed. If it is the number you want type a 3, 5, or 6 and the
number will be dialed at that baud rate (3=300, 5=1200, 6=2400). If it wasn't
the one you wanted, pressing the ESC key will return you to the prompt.
Pressing any other key will continue the search.
	If no matches are found, the program will return to the prompt.
	If you wish to exit the program without dialing a number, enter "Menu"
at the prompt. (if you haven't changed you function key definitions this may be
done by pressing F8).

			Dialing
	After you have found the number you want, pressing 3, 5, or 6 will dial
it. Do *NOT* press enter!!
	The modem will dial the number at the indicated baud rate. The time
will be displayed on the screen. If the modem connects and receives a valid
carrier, a connect message will be displayed.
	If the call does not complete, a line will be displayed consisting of:
An attempt #, a message, and the time of the last attempt
Each new attempt will overwrite this line.
	Which messages will be displayed will depend on your modem. Here is a
list of messages and which types of modems will display them:

	message			300	1200	2400	aborts call?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	connect			x	x	x		N
	ring			x	x	x		N
	no carrier		x	x	x		N
	modem error		x	x	x		Y
	connect 1200			x	x		N
	no dial tone				x		Y
	busy					x		N
	no answer				x		N
 reserved for future use			x		Y
	connect 2400				x		N
	ringing					x		N
	voice					x		Y

			Aborting a call
	To abort a bialing attempt, press any key. At the end of the current attempt you will be returned to the prompt.

				Setup
	This program requires a small amount of setup for different modems.
In line 78 there is a setup string for the modem "ATE1X6V0S0=0S7=20". It
*should* work with all modems, but apparently doesn't. Therefore for 300 baud
modems change X6 to X0. For 1200 baud modems change X6 to X1.
	If you are tight for space, you can remove the lines for the message
that don't apply to your modem (lines 10-22 are the messages). A 300 baud modem
can remove lines 15-22. A 1200 can remove lines 16-22. In either case, remove
the references from line 9 as well.
