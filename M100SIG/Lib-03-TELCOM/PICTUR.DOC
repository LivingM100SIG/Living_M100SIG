PICTUR.BA/PICTUR.CO for the Model 100
By Jim Irwin - 72346,1020
Memory Required: 600 bytes (Program)
                 Up to 10K (Picture)
Files needed: PICTUR.LDR; PICTUR.BAS

PICTUR is a Machine Language processor for the FBI Ten-Most-Wanted pictures and
the on-line Weather maps.  (At the CIS "!" prompt, GO TEN for FBI pictures or 
GO AWX-4 for weather maps).  It uses a 320 byte BASIC program (PICTUR.BA) to 
access a 260 byte Machine Language program (PICTUR.CO).  It also gives you the 
choice of simply displaying pictures or actually printing them.  As far as I 
know, any parallel printer supporting 8-pin bit image graphics can be used.  
Those printers supporting only 7-pin graphics cannot be used.  But you can 
still have fun with this program using the Display mode.  Perhaps to the point 
of contemplating a new printer!

BASIC processors take 7-8 minutes (or more) to do this.  Using this program and
dumping to my Star SG-15 printer (with 16K buffer) takes about 27 seconds.  
Using just the display mode takes only a few seconds.  That's the advantage of 
M/L as opposed to BASIC!

LOADING PICTUR.CO
=================

To load PICTUR into your computer, download PICTUR.LDR first.  That's a program
used to create PICTUR.CO -- the M/L file that does all the work.  When it's 
used, PICTUR.CO operates in the TELCOM previous screen buffer area (64704-65023
).  Therefore, it won't interfere with any other M/L programs you may be 
running!

After downloading PICTUR.LDR, clean up any garbage from the beginning or end of
the file.  Then load it into BASIC and run it.  After about 10 seconds, the 
message "PICTUR.CO created" or "Checksum Error" will appear.  If you get the 
first message, then the load was OK.  Delete PICTUR.LDR.  You don't need it any
more.  If you get the second message, then there is some garbage in the HEX 
data statements.  Look them over, or download PICTUR.LDR again.

LOADING PICTUR.BA
=================

After PICTUR.CO has been successfully created, then you're ready for 
PICTUR.BAS.  This is a BASIC program used to ask for the file name, and asks if
you want to Display or Print the picture.  This, too, could have been done in M
/L but then the program would not have fit in the TELCOM area and would have 
interferred with other M/L programs.  Also, by using BASIC, it makes it easy 
for the user to plug in different printer control codes.  Hopefully, anyone can
modify the program for their particular printer.  That's why I used a BASIC 
interface to a M/L program.

Similar to LDR, download PICTUR.BAS and clean up leading and trailing garbage. 
Load the program into BASIC and then save as PICTUR.BA.  You now have all the 
tools you need to display/print FBI pictures or weather maps!

CUSTOMIZING PICTUR.BA
=====================

Lines 2 and 3 of PICTUR.BA are used to hold printer control codes.  Line 2 sets
Y$ equal to the control sequence used to set 1/9 line spacing for your printer 
(8/72, 16/144, or 24/216 are the same thing).  For my Star SG-15:

2 Y$=CHR$(27)+"3"+CHR$(24)

Your printer probably needs something different, so edit line 2 and put your 
control codes in there.  If you set graphic line spacing via a dip switch, 
simply make line 2 as Y$="" and then the program will be fine.

Line 3 sets Z$ equal to the control sequence used to send graphics data to your
printer.  The program sends 480 characters per line.  Typically, this command 
is of the form:

ESC "K" n1 n2

where n1 and n2 represent the number of graphics characters to be sent.  n2 is 
usually in multiples of 256 and n1 is the remainder.  For 480 characters, n2 is
INT(480/256)=1 and the remainder is 480-256=224.  So, for my SG-15, the command
is ESC K 224 1.  In BASIC this becomes:

Z$=CHR$(27)+"K"+CHR$(224)+CHR$(1)+CHR$(0)

Please note the CHR$(0) at the end of the line.  The M/L routine uses that as a
marker for the end of the control characters.  Make sure you have the CHR$(0) 
at the end of your string.  Otherwise, your printer may do some strange stuff!

RUNNING PICTUR.BA
=================

To run the program, access it from the main menu just like any other file.  You
will be asked for "Picture?" at which time you enter the file name where the 
picture data is stored.  After that, you will be asked "<D>isp or <P>rint?"  
Enter D for display, or P for print.  Lower case is OK, too.  If you just hit 
ENTER, you will automatically go to the display mode.

Even after customizing PICTUR.BA you may find some weird stuff going on with 
the print-out.  If so, read on!

CUSTOMIZING PICTUR.CO
=====================

Some printers work backwards from others -- that is, some want a bit to be on 
to fire a pin, others want the bit to be off to fire it.  If your printer image
comes out in reverse video, go to BASIC and do this:

LOADM"PICTUR"
POKE 64904,47
SAVEM"PICTUR",64706,64968

If you want to change it back, change the poke to POKE 64904,0.  Of course, if 
you want to play with reverse video images, this will do the job!

One other printer consideration:  The order of pin firing.  Some printers 
assign bit 0 to the TOP of 8 pins, others assign bit 0 to the bottom pin.  The 
program is set up for printers having Bit 0 at the bottom.  If you get images 
that look like each line is upside down, then your printer works the opposite 
from mine.  To switch things around, run this little BASIC program after 
PICTUR.CO has been loaded:

0 LOADM"PICTUR"
1 DATA 3,12,15,48,51,60,63,192,195,204,207,240,243,252
2 FOR I=64954TO64967:READ D:POKE I,D:NEXT
3 SAVEM"PICTUR",64706,64968



CREDITS
=======

This program is based on Bill Templeton's PIX100.DMP which was based on PIX.M10
by William D. Elkins.  The screen dump is a modification of the one I sell thru
Portable Basics.  Thanks to Bill T. and Ralph Cooper for helping test this.

Be sure to leave me a message if you want help implementing this program.  It's
not very useful, but it sure is fun!!
