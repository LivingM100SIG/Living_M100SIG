  Using a Color Computer to Communicate
            With a Model 100

---------------------------------------

  1.  The TRS80 Color Computer makes a
good mainframe storage device for the
Model 100, with the availability of
disks and communications facility for
the Coco.

  2.  Adapting the Coco to communicate
with the Model 100 is easy, once the
proper communications software and
hardware is obtained.

  3.  This article will detail such
devices.

  4.  For the Coco communications
software, I currently use COLORCOM/E, by
Eigen Systems, of Austin, Texas.  Their
disk terminal software is relatively
inexpensive ($49.95) and supports both
disk input / output, as well as printer
output.

  5.  A null-modem cable must be made to
match the DB25 RS232-C output of the
Model 100 to the 4-pin DIN plug RS232-C
output of the Color computer. Both the
4-pin DIN and DB25 male connector should
be available from any well stocked
electronics parts house, as well as from
any Radio Shack store.

  6.  Construct the two plugs so that
the following connections are made:

 ---------------------------------------
 DB25        Function       4-pin DIN
 ---------------------------------------
  2     Data From 100 to Coco   2

  3     Data From Coco to 100   4

  7           Ground            3


  7.  EXECute COLORCOM/E and go to
command level.  Select Command L (Set
Modem).  Set the following parameters:

    4 - 1200 baud
    1 - Even parity
    1 - 7 bits
    1 - CR normal extension
    2 - Insert Line Feed
    3 - Half Duplex

  8.  Set STAT on the Model 100 to:

           57E2E
    5 - 1200 baud
    7 - 7 bit word
    E - Even parity
    2 - 2 stop bits
    E - Enable X-On / X-Off

  9.  Go into TERM on the Model 100 and
set to half-duplex.

  10. The two computers should now be
talking.

  11. To send a file from COLORCOM/E,
CLEAR the RAM buffer (SHIFT-CLEAR in
Command mode) and (R)ead the file in. 
Return to on-line mode and then set the
download file on the Model 100. When
both are ready and in on-line mode, use
the CNTRL-2 (dump buffer) function to
send the contents.  Since both
COLORCOM/E and the Model 100 support the
same X-On / X-Off characters, no buffers
will be overrun.

  12. To send a file from the Model 100,
you need not clear the RAM buffer, since
COLORCOM/E has a selectable buffer
option with the "S" and "E" commands. 
Send the buffer, then manually enter a
couple of <ENTER>'s on the Model 100
after the file is sent.  This is
necessary to insure that the last line
of the file will not be the last line
received by COLORCOM/E, as the last line
on a RAM buffer can not be written to a
file, an idiosyncracy that is present in
all versions of COLORCOM/E.

  13.  Once the file is in the Color
Computer buffer, it may be written to a
disk file for permanent storage, or
printed through the off-line printing
facilities of COLORCOM/E.

  14. In summary, using the correct
hardware and the appropriate software,
the Color Computer and the Model 100
communicate very well, and the Coco
seems to enjoy being "big brother" to my
Model 100.

  15. Comments and/or questions may be
addressed to me on the Color Computer
SIG (PCS-126).
