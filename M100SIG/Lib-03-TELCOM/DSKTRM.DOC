  Hardware/Instructions for "DSKTRM"
 
   DISK-TERM allows use of the Portable Disk Drive while online to a host
computer.
 
   Hardware IS needed as well as POWER-DISK by Acroatix Inc.
 
   If you have an old Modem or can get your hands on one, you're in business.
   I am using a Radio Shack/Modem 1B that I purchased for 30.00.
 
NOTE: The External Modem is NOT connected to the Mod-100 except by the Remote
Plug of the Cassette Recorder Cable.
 
   You will need to connect the External Modem to the same phone line as the
Mod-100 MDM Cable is connected to.  I use a little adaptor plug that has two
female plugs connected to the same line.
 
   Overall operation is as follows:
 
  POWER-DISK, by Acroatix, Inc must be present and the External Modem power
switch is left on at all times, and of
course in the Originate Mode.
 
1. Run DSKTRM and enter Name of BBS
2. DSKTRM now calls the BBS (from ADRS File). It is CASE SENSITIVE and looks at
the first three letters. i.e. CIS:237-3003<>: or DEN:761-3445<>:
3. At this point the F-Keys have the following functions:
 
   [F1] = Pause    [F5] = LFil
   [F2] = Down     [F6] = Fre
   [F3] = Up       [F7] = Dir
   [F4] = Tel      [F8] = Bye
 
4. Anytime you select [F2] (DownLoad) the File is downloaded to RAM, then press
Abt (F8) and then it will be SAVED to Disk. After this the RAM File is Killed.
  Note: After DownLoad is completed to RAM, the External Modem is turned on via
the MOTOR ON Cassette Command and the RAM file is SAVED to Disk. After which
the Mod-100 MDM is connected back on line and the External Modem is turned off.
All this is Automatic.
 
5. When [F5] (LFiles) is selected the External Modem is turned on and the MDM
turned off. Then the Files that are on Disk are shown on screen.
 
   The hardware needed is easy to install.  You'll need a Modem (any type 300
baud) and a Sub-Minature female jack.
 
   The Sub-Minature female jack is installed on the Modem and is for the
Connection of the Cassette Recorder Remote Plug.
 
   Wiring of the Jack is as follows.
 
   From the back of plug, with the spring-loaded flat blade at the bottom,
you'll see 3 solder lugs.
   Inside the Modem, locate and cut the Green wire going OUT to the phone line.
   One of these ends are connected to the right lug and the other to the left
lug.  Then solder a short wire from the center lug to the right lug.  This last
wire allows for the Normal Operation of the Modem when not being used with the
Mod-100 and there is no Male Jack inserted.
 
  I did not deem Uploading from Disk important enough to lenghten the Program.
Upload is from RAM only.  At the present it's 3409 bytes in .DO and 2298 bytes
in .BA
  However feel free to experiment, but remember to back up all files first.
Alteration of this program can be "COLD START CITY".
 
  I hope this is clear enough, but if you have any problems with it let me
know.
