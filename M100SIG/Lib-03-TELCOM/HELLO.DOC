  HELL0.BA 
  for Model 100 and Tandy 200
 
   HELLO.BA was written to help 
 reporters send stories to a central
 editorial computer using a Model 100.
 The goal: extreme user friendliness.
 It's supposed to be idiot-proof.
   "Hello, sweetheart, get me rewrite"
 is from a poster at a reporters'
 convention in New York sponsored 
 by (MORE) Magazine several years ago.
 No offence.
 
   If you're using a Tandy 200, then
 also download HELLO.200. It's a short
 "overlay" to fix ROM calls. Store it 
 as "FIX.DO", then run HELLO.100. Hit
 BREAK (Shift-Pause). Now type this:
 MERGE"Fix.do" <Enter>. There. Now
 HELLO.100 has become HELLO.200.
 
   If you need line feeds for your
 system, download HELLO.LF. It's
 another "overlay" for the program.
 Follow same procedure as above.
 
   Some editing is required to get the
 program running:
  Line 810: Insert system phone number.
  Line 830: Insert newspaper name
  Line 240: Add your system's hidden
           start-of-message code in
           decimal. Just take out the
           colon and 'REMarks and add
           the right decimal CHR$()s.
           Your system mgr will have
           them. Or see the spec sheet
           from your old Telerams.
           This could include anything
           up to story slug. For our
           system (CSI), we put DESK,
           SLUG,AUTHOR with the text.
           You may even want to add
           code to conform with AP/UPI
           headers for sorting copy,
           priority, etc., etc. I'd be
           glad to try customizing for
           a small fee.
  Line 290  Add end-of-message code, as
           with line 240.
  Line 190  Sets modem parameters at
           M7E2D. Easily altered.
  Line 1210 Sets word counter for an
           average of 250 letters per
           typeset column-inch. Needs
           experimentation to meet
           individual needs.
 
  The screen echo is kind of fakey (see
 lines 250-280). I still haven't worked
 out a genuine carrier check. Tips
 would be welcome.
 
  HELLO isn't set up for Tymnet or 
 Telenet, but adaptations should be
 easy.
