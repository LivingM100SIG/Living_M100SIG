 After seeing TVTIME in DL2 I thought this information might be of use to 
someone. This file describes how I have been conecting my Model 100 to Sony's 
BVE-800 Video Editor, to download the edit list for saving to disk and later 
use. At this time I have not been able to Upload to the editor, but I know it 
is possable.
  The 800 editor has a small computer installed and can store up to 128 edit in
memory. Each day after editing I dump the list to the 100 and append it to the 
previous days work. After finishing the show I print out the list and file it 
with the video tape. I have uploaded the list to a CMX editor, which can save a
lot of time, and on occasion I have used the list to reconstuct a "crashed" 
video tape.
  I also load a copy of the list into Lucid and use it to sort the list. First 
save a copy of the list then go into WriteROM and select Replace. Replace ' 0' 
(Space-Zero) with '  "0' (Space-Space-Quote-Zero). Then use Cut and Paste and 
make a copy to Lucid. One way I use Lucid is to delete everthing except the 
recorder in points. I sort them and paste it back into text and then add the 
captions. Normaly when you sort the edit list it is by the recorder in points, 
whith Lucid everything stays intact except the Edit Numbers, I keep a .CA file 
with '1' thru '128' in column A and paste this in to the Edit list after 
sorting and deleting the original edit numbers. I also use Lucid for script 
writing, but let's get back on track. I whould'n even think of not downloading 
the list these days.
  The easy part is the setting the STAT. As the editor comes out of the box it 
is set to 38N1D. These can be canged by an engineer internaly by setting DIP 
switches. The baud rate can be set up to 1200.
  Next you'll need a cable as far as I know there is no place to buy one so 
you'll have to make it or have it made. You'll need two DB-25 conectors and 
about 3 feet of three conector cable. The manuals give the following info:
 
  Sony               Model 100
 
Pin  Signal        Pin  Signal
 1 - Data In        1 - Gnd
 2 - Data Out       2 - Data Out
 3 - Reader Start   3 - Data In
 4 - Ready          4 - Request to Send
 7 - Busy           5 - Clear to Send
14-25 Gnd           6 - Data Set Ready
                    7 - Gnd
                   20 - Terminal Ready
 
  This translate to:
 
 BVE 800   M-100
 Pin  1 to Pin 2
 Pin  2 to Pin 3
 Pin 14 to Pin 7
 
  Now your ready to go. Plug the 800 end into the TTY conector on the 800 and 
the other end into the Model-100. It will not work if pluged in backwards so I 
marked each end of the cable. Go into TELCOM and set the STAT. On the BVE-800 
move to the first edit you want to dump. Press "Down" on the 100 and enter the 
file name. Press "CONT" on the BVE-800, the 800's display will show the current
edit number and a dash. Enter on the 800 the last Edit number, or '128' if not 
known, and then press "DUMP". On the 100 the word "TITLE:" should appear and 
the Dump light will flash, just press "DUMP" again and the edit list will read 
out on the 100 as the 800 steps through the edits. If an edit is missing an in 
or out point the 800 will stop and report "ERROR". After the first dump the 
title promt will not be repeated. When the download is complete go into the 
text file and you'll see something like this:
 
TITLE:
FCM: NON-DROP FRAME
001   BL  AA/V   C        00:00:00:00 01:00:44:29 23:59:15:00 00:59:59:29 
002   BL  AA/V   C        00:00:00:00 00:00:30:00 23:59:30:00 00:00:00:00

006  003  A      C        00:18:38:05 00:18:46:07 00:00:29:10 00:00:37:12 
 
  For title I put my initals date and master tape number:
TITLE: FSE    16 JUL 86  MASTER # 84033
  FCM stands for Frame Count Mode. This will either be Drop Frame or Non-drop 
Frame.
  Each edit has an Edit number, Reel number, type edit, Cut, Player In Point, 
Player Out Point, Recoder In Point, Recorder Out Point. I add the following 
line between FCM and edit #1, for easer reading when I make a printout:
 
Edit Reel Mode   Cut       Player In   Player Out   Record In   Record Out
 
 If the reel number is BL (Black) that means you used AUX, and the player in 
and out points are not valid.
 Mode A = Audio ch.1, A2 = Audio ch.2, AA = Both Audio chanels, V = Video
 Cut is either 'C' or 'D' (Disolve). 'D' means the edit was an A/B roll, notice
how edit 003 is listed twice. The extra '000' is the disolve time.
 Split is for when you have used the Audio In button. See edit 004.
 
  I hope someone finds this file useful, for the longest time I thought I was 
the only cameraman/editor on this SIG. I also hope that some day I figure out 
how to upload the edit list back into the editor. I have an Edit Lister program
for time code management, that I've been working on for a long time but it's 
just about useless without some kind of upload.
  If you have any questions or suggestions, send me E-mail as I do a lot of 
traveling and may not be on the SIG for weeks at a time.
