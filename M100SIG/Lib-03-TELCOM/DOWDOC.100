I have designed a program to facilitate
logging on to and storing of Dow Jones
news data.  The program was written to
show the communications capabilites of
the TRS -80 Model 100.  Its features
are as follows:

  1. Logon by either the Tymnet or
     Telemet packet switching network.

  2. Auto logon defineable for people
     that consistently ask for the same
     items each time they call Dow
     Jones.

  3. The ability to create a separate
     file for each individual or group
     of calls to Dow Jones.

  4. Error trapping to:

     a. Prevent use of an auto-logon
        file that is incorrect.

     b. Check to see if the auto-logon
        file has actually been created.


I have made extensive use of the
editing features of BASIC to duplicate
subroutines.  Efficient programing
would dictate that these should be made
into GOSUB routines.  I was so
intrigued by the ability to move blocks
that the program has become much longer
than it needs to be.

Also many more files than needed were
opened using the MAXFILES declaration.
This again was done to test the file
handling capabilities of the Model 100.

The instructions are pretty much self
explanatory.  Be sure to set STAT to ->
M7I1d,xx where xx is either 10 or 20.
Two data files are declared during
initialization.  They are:

  1. QUOTE.DO  --> Default file to
     store Dow Jones news.

  2. AUTO.DO   --> Stores your auto-
     logon procedure.


The only problem I have seen is where
the connection with Dow Jones
occassionaly hangs and gives you no
indication of what has happened.  As
noted on page 30 of the Model 100
manual under 'Important Note', the
telephone line will not be "released".


I present you with three challenges:

  1. Make better utilization of memory
     space and condense the program.

  2. Write a routine to have the Model
     100 dial at a certain time each
     day using the ON TIME$ GOSUB.

  3. Detect that you have indeed become
     disconneted and issue a CALL 21179.
