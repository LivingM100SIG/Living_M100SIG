          X-TEL v2.1 Specific
              Denny Thomas
 
  If you have a 1200 baud modem and want to be able to use it effectively
with the Model 100, you need to disable the scrolling of the screen. This
program will allow you to do this painlessly.
 
  Before using this program, check the beginning address of X-Tel. This is
done by going into basic and typing:
 
  LOADM"X-TEL
 
  Use the "TOP:" address to change the 3 CALL 53930 instructions in lines 8,9
and 10.
 
 This *very* important as the program will bomb if this is done
incorrectly.
 
  If you have used the automatic relocating function of the X-TEL loader
to relocate around the Chipmunk operating system, these changes
shouldn't be necessary.
 
         Running SCROLL.BA
 
  First, load SCROLL in ram as a .DO file. This may seem strange, but it
will cut down on your keystrokes.
  Next, go online as you normally would with X-TEL. Once connected you can, at
any time, disable the scroll by pressing the CODE and SHIFT keys and
while holding them down, press the F7  (BASI)  key. This will drop you into
basic where you type:
 
  RUN"SCROLL
 
 It will take a second to load the program the first time. Subsequent
accesses to SCROLL will just require you to go into basic (CODE+SHIFT+F7)
and hit the F4 (run) key. If you make SCROLL a basic program, you will have
to type RUN"SCROLL each time.
 
 As you can see, this is the simplest implementation of X-Tel's newest
feature. I have other online programs in the planning stages, but suggestions
for new programs and routines would be muchly appreciated. (A Chipmunk folder
searching and switching routine is in the works.)
               Have Fun,
