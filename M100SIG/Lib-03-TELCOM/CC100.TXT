THIS IS SOMETHING I THROUGHT I WOULD 
SHARE WITH YOU. I HAVE A TRS-80 COLOR
COMPUTER WHICH I HAVE HAD FOR ABOUT TWO
YEARS. AFTER PURCHASING MY MODEL 100 I
READ THE INSTRUCTION BOOK THAT COMES 
WITH IT. ON PAGE 193,IT STATES THAT 
YOU CAN CONNECT TO THE MODEL II,III,AND
16 . I WAS WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE
POSSIBLE TO TRANSFER FILES BETWEEN MY
COLOR COMPUTER AND THE MODEL 100. IF
YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING ITEMS,IT CAN BE
DONE. (A) TRS80 MODEM I (B)COLOR SCRIPT
[ROM PACK]. (C) COLORCOM E-ELGIN SYSTEMS
HERE IS THE PROCEDURE TO FOLLOW       
 (1) CSAVE THE BASIC PROGRAM OR TEXT
FILE IN ASCII. (2) INSERT ROM SCRIPT 
PACK
(3)LOAD FILE FROM TAPE (4)USE BLANK TAPE
AND USE OPTION "PRINT TO TAPE"
(5)REPLACE SCRIPT ROM PACK WITH COLORCOM
E ROM PACK
(6)USE READ OPTION IN COMMAND MODE.
(7)LEAVE TELCOM PARAMETERS AT START-UP
SETTING (M7I1E,10pps).
(8) CHANGE PARAMETERS ON COLORCOM E IN
COMMAND MODE-(L-KEY) TO MATCH MODEL 100
(9) CONNECT TELEPHONE MODEM WIRE FROM
MODEL 100 TO MODEM I TELEPHONE WIRE VIA
A DOUBLE FEMALE MODUAL CONNECTOR
(10) GO TO TELCOM-SET UP FOR DOWNLOAD
(11) SET MODEL 100 FOR ANSWER.
(12) SET MODEM I TO ORIGINATE.
(13) FROM COMMAND MODE ON COLORCOM E
USE CONTROL 2 - TO UPLOAD TO MODEL 100

I WOULD APPRCIATE ANY COMMENTS YOU MAY
HAVE ABOUT THE ABOVE PROCEDURE
