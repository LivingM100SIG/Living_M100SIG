     O.K. so now to the "final" solution. My M-100 Mass storage system is a 
TRS80 Color Computer with two disks, running OS9, and a Novation J-CAT modem! 
In the words of E.T., whenever I need access to my files I "phone home". With
the 6809 based CoCo and OS9, I have a true Multi-user system. (for those of
you who are familiar with UNIX, OS9 is an implementation of that operating
system on the 6809 microprocessor.) 
   This means that I can do anything sitting in my office, using my M-100, that
I can do at home, except for physical operations such as changing disks. There
are no charges for connect time, and while on business, even the phone call
is a business expense. 
     So, having acquired my CoCo, disk drives and OS9, I set about the task of
getting a Mass Storage system "on-line". The first thing to do was to get the
CoCo up in the multi-user mode. The OS9 manual gives you the precise key-in:
<TSMON /T1&> does it. 
   I also set the /T1 baud rate to 300 by typing <TMODE BAUD=1>. These Commands
will eventually be placed in the STARTUP file. This is a Command Procedure File
that OS9 automatically executes each time it boots, similar to the M-100 IPL.
The startup file I use is illustrated in Listing 3, Startup file. (Note that I
also do a "dummy" SETIME in this file. This is there to prevent the system from
"hanging" when it reboots itself after a power glitch with no one home.) 
 The initial setup did not use the modem but an RS-232 cable and a null modem
or "direct connection". I won't go into the details of this arrangement because
I don't use it any more, and I don't advocate that the reader spend $30 for a
null modem, and $30 for a cable that may not be used; but it was a step in the
process.  (I now always use the modem, even if I'm at home. More about that
later.)
    Downloading is the easiest of all operations, it is done "bare", using only
OS9 and TELCOM. For example, if the file to download is on the 2nd disk drive
(D1) in the directory "files" and its name is "radar.100", simply type <list
/d1/files/radar.100>, and the file comes pouring into the M-100. (Providing
that the M-100 is set up for a function key 2 download). 
   Uploading, however, is a horse of a different color. First, let me mention a
limitation of the CoCo RS-232 port. It operates reliably at 300-baud ,period.
The CoCo lacks a true serial port which means that an 8 bit byte requires 8 S/W
I/O operations.  The result is that the S/W loses characters at rates higher
than 300-baud.  In addition, in order to echo characters the S/W must do
everything twice. As a result, if the M-100 sends back-to-back characters, as
when using TELCOM function key 3, the CoCo appears to lose every other one.
(The OS9UPLOADER solves this problem by turning echo off with a <TMODE -ECHO>.)
 A second problem with uploading is the fact that both OS9 BUILD and EDIT
utilities use a rather shortish line length limit. (127 characters per line, I
think, but I've never counted.) This creates difficulties with M-100 basic
programs which allow 255 character lines. To solve this problem, I have written
a 6809 assembly language program called UPLOAD. (see listing 2) When you
assemble UPLOAD and direct the assembler to place the object code in the CMDS
directory UPLOAD becomes a system command. This ability to install new commands
is but one of the many powerful features of OS9. The assembler key-in looks
like this: <asm #10k /d1/files/upload O=/d0/cmds/upload>. Note that this key-in
includes a reservation of 10k of memory for the assembler to use. The program
is not large, but it uses the system definitions file which is huge.  (Without
the #10k the asm will return a symbol table full error.) Note that the
character to the left of the equal sign is the capital O, not zero, and stands
for "Object".  UPLOAD works just like BUILD, except that the terminator is
<esc> rather than back-to-back cr's. (this way back-to back cr's in the upload
file are allowable.)
    At this point I'll talk about the OS9 UPLOADER program. (Listing 1) The
version included with this article is not the original, but is the stripped
down version I actually use. When logging on and setting TMODE -ECHO my
original program used a delay rather than spaces to get around the dropped
characters, (echo), problem mentioned above. This version, however, has never
failed to work for me unless I violate some OS9 rule, (see below.) 
    Before using the OS9 UPLOADER in your M-100, you must edit line 2 to
include your own phone#, user name and password. The password file that comes
with OS9 includes USER1, USER2, with no password required. I suggest that you
stick with this until you get everything working, then edit your password file
and OS9UPLOADER for the real thing. Don't be tempted to leave out the spaces in
the user name and the T M O D E - E C H O, if you do, it won't work for the
reasons stated above. (Note that you don't need spaces in your password, since
the CoCo doesn't echo those characters.) By the way, you could simply turn off
echo all the time and put the M-100 in the half duplex mode, but this gets
confusing at times. 
    With all of this working, I turned to the modem hook-up. It turns out that
all you need is the #26-3014 CoCo cable which simply plugs in to the J-Cat
cable.  That sounds simple, except for one problem. In the RS-232 world there
are two possible ground pins in the db-25 connector, and, you guessed it, the
CoCo cable used one and the J-Cat the other. Since it gave me some spare pins
to use, I modified the J-Cat Cable. I cut off a spare with about 1" of wire
attached, spliced it into the ground wire, pin 7 (seven) of the J-cat
connector. I then shoved it into the socket hole corresponding to the CoCo
ground pin 1 (one) and I was in business. 
    While using this system at home, I soon became bored with switching
everything back and forth between the MODEM and the NULL-MODEM and M-100 rs-232
port. Earlier I mentioned that I always use my M-100 built-in MODEM, even when
I am working at home. Here's how I accomplish that:
 In my house, there are phone outlets all over the place. I think a former
owner worked for Ma Bell (RIP). In all of those outlets, only the center pair
of contacts were used for actual phone operation, corresponding to the red and
green wires. The yellow and black pair was unused. I'm speaking in the past
tense, because that yellow-black pair is now my in-house communications path.
This was accomplished by installing an extra phone jack near my CoCo into which
the MODEM is plugged. This jack has a tiny DPDT switch in it which toggles the
center pair of socket conductors, (and hence the MODEM), back and forth between
the red-green, and yellow-black pairs. To compliment this, I have a modified
M-100 MODEM cable, which switches the red-green and yellow-black pairs going to
the M-100. (by the way, if you try this yourself, do not be tempted to use SPDT
switches, you must have complete isolation from the phone line!) When at home,
I simply switch the two switches to the correct positions and plug the M-100 in
to any jack.  Before I can communicate, however, the MODEM must be brought
"on-line".  This is normally accomplished when you "phone home" by the ringing
signal.  Locally you have no ring so the modem will not "answer". To date, the
only solution I have to this problem is to tap the "Connect" switch on the
J-cat while the M-100 is waiting in the TELCOM mode. By the way, the J-cat can
operate in both answer or originate mode, (it automatically "trains" itself,
depending on what the other end is doing), so you can leave the M-100 switch in
whatever position you normally use.
    To recap the steps in implementing the system:
   1) Install OS9 in a CoCo with one or two disk drives.
   2) Edit the STARTUP file.(see example STARTUP)
   3) Install UPLOAD in the CMDS directory of OS9, using ASM.
   4) Install OS9UPLOADER in your M-100.
      (not caring for long names I label it UPL)
   5) Install your modem. (remember the cable fix if you use a J-cat).
   6) Either buy a NULL-MODEM and RS-232 cable, use the in-house method, or
simply connect the M-100 modem cable directly to the MODEM using the squareish
back-to-back modular connector supplied with the M-100 cable. 
   7) Set your M-100 stat to M8N1D. (By the way, this is the same as used on
Compuserve when downloading weather service RADAR maps, you can use it all the
time on CIS if you set your terminal parameters to no parity. It also works on
a VAX)
   The first thing to try is operating the M-100 as a terminal to OS9. Bring up
OS9, activate /T1 (TSMON or STARTUP) and make a local connection by one of the
three methods in 6 above. When connected, type <cr>. After a short delay, OS9
should come up and ask you for a user I.D. When you respond according to the
contents of your password file, the MOTD (message of the day) file will appear
on your M-100 screen. When you see the prompt OS9: you can do anything from
your M-100 that you can do from the CoCo keyboard. Try a DIR.
 The next step is to do a download from the CoCo. Try setting up the M-100 for
download, and typing LIST SYS/PASSWORD. This is a good way to edit your
password file, once you can do uploads you can delete or rename the original
and upload the new one.
     To use the OS9UPLOADER, you must first have the file to upload in the .DO
format.  Then start the program, answer the prompts and watch it go. (If you
happen to be at home, using one of the local methods, just wait 'till you see
the phone number and place you modem in the connect mode.) Note that the
Command that you enter on prompt 2 is in the same format as you might enter it
on the CoCo.  For example <upload /d1/files/radar.100>. (Shortcuts like
changing the directory to /d1/files prior to uploading are possible. In that
case the command would be <upload radar.100>, but don't get confused.) If you
do something wrong, like trying to upload a file that already exists, you won't
see any error indication, the OS9UPLOADER simply hangs, waiting for the ? from
UPLOAD.  If this happens, you must break the program <shift-break>, enter
TELCOM, manually re-call your CoCo and fix the problem. (ie: delete the old
file). With the J-cat, a short delay in the re-call is necessary (18 seconds)
to wait for the J-cat to hang up. When you re-establish contact and the CoCo
doesn't echo your characters, type TMODE ECHO.
 A final criticism of this system is that up and downloading at 300-baud is too
slow. Well, not for me! I am perfectly content to start a long file and go get
a cup of coffee. The operation is similar to working with compuserve databases;
it's so simple to use that you don't mind the waits. Since I've been using this
system, and since I started writing this article, RS has announced a disk
system for the M-100. The price tag is near $800. I think my approach is
better, but you be the Judge!
