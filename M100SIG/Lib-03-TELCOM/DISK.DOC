What it does :

Disk.100 transferes .do- and .ba- files from and to a desktop computer 
via rs 232 using the utility program 'pip' in the cp/m dos.

All keyboard input and all display including file directory of disk is
done on m100.
Disk.100 not only transferes datas it also lets you operate the desktop
from m100.

Disk.100 resides as .ba file on 2,777 bytes and uses an other 1145 
bytes if it runs.

How it works :

Disk.100 is used since about six months together with a 'AMPRO little
board computer' using 'pip' of cp/m dos without any problems.

Disk.100 should also work with any other computer using cp/m dos.
It should be possible to modify Disk.100 for use with ms dos after changing
the specific comands in lines 35,39,53,62 and 69.

Disk.100 transfers with the 19,200 baud if your desktop can't handle that
change variable d in line 1.

How to install :

Load Disk.100 and save it as

            DISK.BA

DON'T USE AN OTHER NAME IT WILL NOT WORK!

Each diskette you want to use with Disk.100 MUST contain the cp/m system
and the cp/m utility 'pip'.

If you have a coldstart program you can define one of the function keys
with 
"Disk"+chr$(24)+"run"+chr$(34)+"disk"+chr$(13)
and you will have access to the
program with ONE keystroke.
You also should open a file with the name 'year' containing '86'.

Functions :

 - start up
After start up Disk.100 shows the program title on the screen and tries
to load 'pip' in the desktop.
If not already done now is the time to turn on your desktop and feed it
with a diskette.
After loading 'pip' the screen clears and you will see '*' in the upper
corner of your screen and there will be a new definition of the m100
function keys.
From now on your desktop will accept all 'pip' comands from m100. You
can leave 'pip' just by pushing <cr> and the system will return with 'A>'
on the m100 screen and cp/m of your desktop is waiting for cp/m comands.
If you read a file and want to stop the display just push 'break'.
Push 'break' again and the display will continue.
IMPORTANT:
Disk.100 can't be stopped with ctrlc or shift break.
If something goes wrong the system jumps to an 'error trap' showing error
and error line with a terrible sound.
If the program should hang up then push the 'reset button' ONCE.
You will be back in the main menu without coldstart.


 - f1 = prev

f1 acts like 'prev' in the TELCOM program and shows you the previous 8
lines of the screen.

 - f2 = down

This routine loads a .txt file from disk as .do file to m100 and starts
displaying all .txt files of the diskette on the m100 screen and
finishes display with
	'filename: ?'
Input the filename WITHOUT extention '.txt' and the system answers with
	'downloading...'
The disk file display can be finished anytime by pushing any key. This
might be useful if there are lots of files on disk but you already know
the name of the file you want to download.
During the downloading a counter in the lower right corner shows you
something is happening.
After downloading the .txt file as .do file in m100 the system returns
again with
	'filename :?'
If there is no other file to load then just push <cr> that brings you
back to disk.100 menu.

 - f3 = up

This routine transferes a .do file of m100 as .txt file to disk and
starts with displaying all m100 .do files in a simular way as menu does.
The file you want to upload is selected by using the arrow keys.
Each selected file displays the name and file length.
Push <cr> and the system will answer with 'uploading...' and the counter
in the right lower corner tells you something is happening.
After the operation is finished the system lets you select an other
file to upload.
Pushing 'esc' brings you back to the disk.100 menu.
IMPORTANT !
If you want to transfer one file to different disks you can do that but
you have to send a ctrlc to the desktop after changing the disk.

 -f4 = Cdsk

This routine lets you upload cas: files directly to disk.
You can prepare a file called 'casfil' with the name of the cas: file in
each line.
Disk.100 will read this file and upload all files mentioned in 'casfil'
automaticly.
If there is no 'casfil' disk.100 will answer with
	'filename :?'
and ask you for input.
For leaving this routine just push <cr> without putting in a name.

 -f5 = echo

This function key acts like ECHO in TELCOM and everything on the m100
screen will also be printed.

 -f6 = load

This routine loads a .bas file on disk as .ba file to m100 and starts
with a display of all .bas files available on disk.
'Load' acts like 'down' but you wan't see a running counter and the
transfer seems to be slow because of the conversion from ASCII to basic.
After downloading the system saves the file as .ba file and returns with
the disk.100 menu.

 -f7 = save

This routine loads a .ba file from m100 to disk as .bas file and starts
with a display of all .ba files in m100.
Files are selected by using the arrow keys and the screen shows the
length of the selected file.
<cr> starts uploading the file and 'esc' lets you leave the routine without
transfer. After transfer the system returns with the disk.100 menu.

 -f8 = menu

Pushing f8 brings you back to m100 main menu setting maxfiles=1 and
stringspace=256. It also makes sure the year in date$ is correct.
