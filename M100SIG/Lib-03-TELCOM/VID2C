Using Vidtex 4.0 for CoCo 
 to Model 100 Communications
............................
1. Wayne Day has already shown how to use Colorcom/E for the TRS-80 Color Computer to communicate with the TRS-80 Model 100.  This 
file details how to use Compuserve's Vidtex 4.0 to do the same thing.
-----
2. As in Wayne's file, the first thing needed is a null modem cable, that is, a cable hooked directly between the correct pinout on 

the Color Computer and the Model 100. The pins are connected as follows:
                          4-pin
  DB25       Function      DIN
  ----    -------------   -----
   2  data from 100 to CoCo   2
   3  data from CoCo to 100   4
   7          Ground          3
-----
4. Execute Vidtex and go to the menu. Go to the third page of the menu and select command Q to set the Vidtex defaults as follows:
    0 PARITY E
    1 DUPLEX H
    2 FLOW   Y
    3 A-BAUD ?  (printer)
    4 B-BAUD 4
(note: This version of Vidtex has a maximum baud rate of 600 baud.)
-----
5. Set the STAT parameters on the Model 100 as follows:
         47E2E
   4 - 600 baud
   7 - 7 bit word
   E - Even parity
   2 - 2 stop bits
   E - Enable X-On/X-Off
-----
6. Hit enter on the CoCo and F4 on the 100 to get into terminal mode.  Now your computers should be in communication.
-----
7. To send a file from Vidtex to the 100, go to the menu (up-arrow/M) and select command L to load your file into the CoCo buffer.  

Once the file is loaded in, return to the menu.  On the 100, select F2 to initiate download, and type in the filename, then hit 
enter.  Select V on the CoCo and watch your file read into the 100!  By previously selecting 'Y' on the CoCo flow control parameter,

you activated the X-On/X-Off characters and the CoCo will automatically pause and resume if the 100's buffer can't absorb the 
download fast enough.  That way you won't lose anything.
-----
8. To send a file from the 100 to the CoCo, return to the Vidtex menu, and select O to open the CoCo buffer. Hit <enter> twice to 
return to terminal mode. Now on the 100, select F3 to upload, and type in the file name.  Of course, the file must already be in the

100 with an extension of .DO. Type in the desired line length (up to the maximum of 132) and hit enter.  Your file should now be 
appearing on your CoCo screen!  
-----
9. This is another example of how to communicate between your CoCo and your Model 100.  The main drawback to Vidtex as compared to 
Colorcom/E is the slower maximum transfer rate (600 vs. 1200) but it does work well, and provides Vidtex owners with an easy-to-use 

transfer method.

10. Please address any comments or questions to me on either the Color Computer Forum (PCS-126) or on the Model 100 Forum (PCS-154).

This file was created on a Model 100 and uploaded to my CoCo using this method, and then uploaded from the CoCo to CIS.  All because

I left my Model 100's modem cable at work...
