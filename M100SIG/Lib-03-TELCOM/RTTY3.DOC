This is a modification of the program RTTY.100 in DL0.  It is designed for the
SWL, hence is receive only.  All commands are entered using function keys as
follows:

F1 - Rolls the baud rate from 60 thru 100 wpm

F2 - Toggles unshift-on-space (indicated by "UOS" or "uos" in label line).
Handy for copying WX traffic.

F5 - Turns label line on and off.

F6 - Forces a "FIGS" shift and a LF/CR

F7 - Turns on printer echo

F8 - Returns user to menu.

See RTTY.DOC in DL0 for more details

Enhancements in RTTY3:

 - function key labels (toggled on and off by F5)

 - rolling display of speed

 - Unshift on space option

 - Bell character deleted

 - Removal of transmit code

Suggestions for use:

  I have had good results copying RTTY using the M100 dierctly connected to an
MFJ 1225 RTTY/CW interface, using a Sony ICF-2010 receiver.  The interface
costs about $60, and will work with any stable shortwave radio.  I've copied
VOA news wire relays from Kavasa, Greece, hams and WX stations all up and down
the East Coast.

The progam is pretty straight forward and easy to modify for any specialized
purposes.  The only really tricky parts are the UART set up for the odd-ball
speed used by RTTY and the Baudot to ASCII translation...wish I could take
credit for those parts!

Anybody want to add AMTOR, TOR, FEC and ARQ?   CW?
