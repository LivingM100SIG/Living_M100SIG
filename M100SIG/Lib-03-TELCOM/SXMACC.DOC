      SXMACC  along  with  SXMMRG.ACC  are  designed to be used with SXM.100
      Xmodem program in this Data Library.  SXMACC.RLC is  the  loader  file
      for  a  small  (100  byte) machine language program that can be loaded
      anywhere in memory with the RLCLDR program found in this SIG.  It will
      allow you to enter TELCOM while using SXM  and  then  return  to  SXM.
      Originally,  the  path  to  TELCOM from within the SXM program was one
      way.  If you entered TELCOM  and  later  had  a  file  you  wanted  to
      download  with  Xmodem protocol, or to disk or cassette or another ram
      bank (with RAM+ by PSCG) you had to log off, hang-up and redial.

      SXMACC lets you enter TELCOM and then return to SXM and then  back  to
      TELCOM at will.  An added bonus is the ability to use DIRACC.100 while
      in  TELCOM  to  edit  TEXT files, maintaining your on-line connection.
      You can then return to TELCOM or SXM and upload that file.

                                LOADING THE PROGRAM

      You will need the following programs:

        1.  SXMACC.RLC
        2.  SXMMRG.ACC
        3.  SXMACC.DOC (Small program inside documentation)
        4.  RLCLDR.100
        5.  SXM.100 or SXM.CHP

      If you don't already have RLCLDR.100 by Neil Wick, you  must  download
      that  program.   It  is  a  relocatable  loader  for SXMACC.RLC.  With
      SXMACC.RLC in memory, run RLCLDR.  It will give you three  choices  of
      things  to  do.  You want to 'Load from a DO file'.  It will ask for a
      start address.  The program is 100 bytes long, so it  must  reside  at
      62859  or  lower.   When  finished, you have a program saved in memory
      called SXMACC.CO.

      Now you need  to  edit  the  patch  for  SXM.   This  file  is  called
      SXMMRG.ACC.   Lines  97 and 98 contain the address of 62859.  In TEXT,
      change that address to the start address of  SXMACC,  where  ever  you
      loaded  it.   There  is  a  PEEK command in line 97 to check to see if
      SXMACC is loaded before calling it in line 97.   If  not  loaded,  SXM
      jumps  to TELCOM as in the original version.  Also, as in the original
      version, there is no return.

      To use DIRACC.100 with this program, you need  to  run  the  following
      utility, after you have loaded SXMACC and DIRACC.

      This  program  will  save  DIRACC  and  SXMACC together as one program
      called SXMDIR.CO.  To use it, use the F7 key in TEXT  and  select  the
      program portion above, then with the F5 key, copy it.  Go to BASIC and
      press  PASTE and the program will be copied into BASIC and can then be
      saved or you can just run it.

      The above BASIC program chops off the bottom byte of  DIRACC  when  it
      saves  it  as  SXMDIR.   That  byte  is  a POP command to maintain the
      integrity of the stack.  SXMACC has already  done  this  so  it  isn't
      necessary to do it again.

      To summarize the complete loading process:

      1.  With  the  .DO  file from SXMACC.RLC loaded into memory run RLCLDR
          from this SIG

      2.  Edit lines 97 and 98 of SXMMRG.ACC to  reflect  the  proper  start
          address of SXMACC.

      3.  Run DIRACC.100 also from this SIG

      4.  With  DIRACC  and  SXMACC  loaded  in  memory, run the small BASIC
          program you copied out of SXMACC.DOC

      4.  Load SXM.100 or SXM.CHP from this SIG

      5.  Type MERGE"SXMMRG" and save your patched version of SXM to tape or
          disk.

      You can now run SXM and enter TELCOM and then enter DIRACC  and  later
      reenter SXM.

                                   USING SXMACC

      Run  SXM  just  as  you  always  have.   Use  the autologin feature or
      manually dial.  At the point where you are on-line and want  to  enter
      TELCOM,  press  F4.  The prompt 'Telcom?' will appear.  Answer 'Y' and
      you will enter TELCOM.  The function key labels will change to let you
      know that you are now in TELCOM instead of the SXM terminal  emulator.
      Pressing  F6  at  any time will return you to the terminal emulator in
      SXM.  Again, the function key labels will return to the SXM labels  to


                                     page -2-







      signal  that  you have indeed returned to SXM.  F4 will now return you
      to TELCOM.  You can go back and forth as often as you like.

      If, as described above,  you have also loaded  DIRACC  also,  then  in
      TELCOM,  F7 will bring you to TEXT where you can edit or create files.
      You must first enter TELCOM to get to DIRACC and TEXT.  After editing,
      F8 will bring you back to TELCOM.  F6 will then return  to  SXM  where
      you could upload the recently edited file with Xmodem protocol.

      What  if  you  wanted  to  use DIRACC's capability to enter BASIC from
      TELCOM?  SXMACC redefines the F6 key to return to SXM  so  that  isn't
      possible.  However, after returning to SXM, the F7 key stops SXM while
      maintaining  the on-line connection as long as you heed the warning in
      the SXM documentation as to what will  cause  a  disconnect  (such  as
      killing a file or MENU).  Thus, you can still return to BASIC, but are
      a little more limited in what you can do.

      If  you  are  not using SXM, but have entered TELCOM directly from the
      menu, the F6 key will then enter BASIC  through  the  DIRACC  program.
      You must enter TELCOM through SXM if you want F6 to return you to SXM,
      otherwise  the  F6  key  acts just like F6 in DIRACC.  In any case, F7
      will always enter TEXT.

                      USING SXMACC WITH OTHER BASIC PROGRAMS

      Actually, SXMACC will allow any BASIC  program  to  enter  TELCOM  and
      return,  not  just  SXM.   To  do  so, the BASIC program must call the
      starting address of SXMACC.  This is the address you  entered  in  the
      RLCLDR  program  at  the  very  beginning.   Thus  you can use it with
      Xmodem.312 or a  program  you  may  have  written  yourself.   As  you
      incorporate  SXMACC  into  other  programs,  be aware of the following
      items:

      1.  Upon returning to BASIC, the function keys will be exactly as they
          are whenever you enter BASIC, however you have defined  them.   If
          the  program which calls SXMACC redefines them temporarily for its
          own use, you must define them again after  the  call.   This  most
          often  entails  calling the subroutine again which was used at the
          beginning of the program to define the keys in  the  first  place.
          That  is  one  of the things accomplished in SXMMRG, the patch for
          SXM

      2.  If is wise to incorporate some kind of test  in  your  program  to
          make  sure  SXMACC is loaded before it is called.  For example, in
          SXMMRG, line 97 peeks at the beginning address to see if indeed it
          contains a decimal 33 which is the  first  byte  of  the  program.
          It's  not foolproof, but you only have one chance in 256 of error.

      3.  If you have done a MDMSTOP or COMSTOP command before the call,  be
          sure to  turn them back on after the call.


      Good Telecommunicating!

NOTE:  Believe it or not, I forgot to upload SXMACC.RLC with Xmodem so
you must edit that file to remove all the carriage return after the first
one, leaving only the first and last carriage return.  Sorry!
