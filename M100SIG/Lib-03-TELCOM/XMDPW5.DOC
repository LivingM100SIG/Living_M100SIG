XMDPW5.DOC -- DOCUMENTATION FOR XMDPW5.100/200/CO
-------------------------------------------------

XMDPW5.CO is a full-featured machine-language communications 
program for Tandy/Kyocera laptop computers.  It is created by 
running the appropriate Basic loader program (XMDPW5.100 for the
100 and 102, XMDPW5.200 for the 200) on your Tandy laptop 
computer.  The resulting program includes:

     o Online access to Basic and Text (based on Hugo Ferreyra's 
       DIRACC code)

     o Split screen while in online conferences (based on code 
       developed by James Yi)

     o Scroll lock (as suggested by Wilson Van Alst) to reduce 
       speed constraints associated with the LCD -- useful in the
       capture mode.

     o Macros (code by Jon Diercks) for use while on line

     o Xmodem protocol file transfers, either CRC or Checksum.

The Xmodem features, and most of the core aspects of the program, 
are derived from XMD100, a program developed in 1985 by J. R. 
Chenoweth.


1. Creating XMDPW5.CO

The first step is to download either XMDPW5.100 or XMDPW5.200 into 
your laptop as XMDPW5.DO.  Then convert the file to a BA file.  
This is straight-forward with a Model 100 or Tandy 102 with full 
memory, but less so with a Tandy 200 (or with less than full
memory in your 100/102).  For the 200, try one of the following
approaches (fortunately, you only need to do it once, so long as
you immediately save the result to disk or cassette).

0. Use DO2BA.200 (Lib 10)

 This is the approach of choice.  Get James Yi's DO2BA.200 and use it to
 create DO2BA.CO in your 200.  Download XMDPW5.200 as XMDPW5.DO, and back it
 up (e.g., to another bank).  Then run DO2BA to convert XMDPW5.DO to
 XMDPW5.BA.  Then -- after doing CLEAR 256,MAXRAM -- run XMDPW5.BA to create
 XMDPW5.CO. Afterward, save everything to a mass storage device (e.g., TDD).

A. Use a Cassette

 If you have (and don't mind using!) a cassette, try the following 
 procedure (which I have verified):

  1) Download XMDPW5.200 into your 200 as XMDPW5.DO, edit any 
     garbage if done with R)ead, verify the checksum (a must!),
     and save to a blank cassette from Text as XMDPW5. 

  2) Empty your 200, or at least the bank in which you will create
     XMDPW5.CO.  You will need almost a whole bank to proceed. Do 
     CLEAR 256,MAXRAM in Basic to recover any RAM reserved by
     machine language programs. 

  3) With the tape rewound, and the recorder in play, go to Basic
     and type RUN"CAS: <ENTER>.  You should get a message that
     XMDPW5 has been found.

  4) At the end of the tape run, the program will run.  Hit ENTER 
     in response to the question. 

 B. Use of Multiple RAM Banks in the 200 

 I haven't tried this, but it should work. 

  1) Download XMDPW5 as above.  Then go into Text and break it
     into two or more roughly equal pieces. 

  2) Leave the first chunk in your working bank, and move the rest
     to another bank.  Clear out memory as above, except for the 
     first chunk of the DO file. 

  3) Go to Basic and load the first chunk, and SAVE the resulting 
     BA program.  Kill the first chunk, and go get the second one,
     and repeat, using the MERGE command in Basic.  Repeat until 
     you have the entire BA program. 

  4) Then, with only XMDPW5.BA on the menu, run it.  Hit ENTER in 
     response to the question. 

Once you have created XMDPW5.BA, run it from the menu.  It will
create XMDPW5.CO, giving you the option of loading it below the
current HIMEM value (do CLEAR 256,MAXRAM before running to put at
the top of user RAM) or at a specified location; running under
MAXRAM (top of user RAM) is typically best.


2. Use of Primary Program Features

This section is adapted from the original documentation by J.R.
Chenoweth.

2.1 Summary of Menu Items (Function Key Assignments)

On entry to the program from your computers menu you will be in
the Command Mode.  The function keys will have the following
assignments:

   <F1> Find: search ADRS.DO for a number (see 'TELCOM' section of
        model 100 operating manual) 
   <F2> Call: dial a selected number, just as in TELCOM 
   <F3> Stat: display or alter the serial port status 
   <F4> File: displays the filename directory, as in BASIC 
   <F5> Free: displays free RAM remaining, as in the MENU display 
   <F6> (unused)
   <F7> Term: switches to normal terminal emulation mode (below)
   <F8> Menu: returns to the MENU

Note that STAT must be set with I)gnore parity when using XMDPW5.
E)ven parity can give erratic results following an Xmodem
download.

Pressing <F7> in the Command Menu takes you to the Normal Terminal 
Menu, with the function keys defined as follows:

   <F1> Prev: displays the previous 8 lines (also Xoff's the
        reception, if enabled) until <F1> is pressed again 
   <F2> Down: downloads just like "TELCOM" (ASCII capture)
   <F3> Up  : uploads just like "TELCOM" 
   <F4> Full or Half: toggles between full and half duplex  
        (remains in effect in XMODEM terminal mode; see model 100 
        operating manual) 

   <F5> Echo (or blank): toggles the printer echoing on and off 
        (remains in effect in XMODEM terminal mode) 
   <F6> Scroll Lock Toggle: says 'Wait' when reception has been 
        stopped by the host (see Model 100 operating manual)
   <F7> Xmod: switches to XMODEM terminal mode (see below) 
   <F8> Bye : returns to command mode, 'Y' to confirm 

As noted, pressing <F7> will take you to the Xmodem Menu, with the 
keys defined as shown here:

   <F1> Prev: displays the previous 8 lines (also Xoff's the
        reception, if enabled) until <F1> is pressed again 
   <F2> Send: sends a .DO file to the host, using XMODEM protocol, 
        beginning by prompting for a filename (.DO ext may be left 
        off)
   <F3> Recv: receives a .DO file from the host, using XMODEM 
        protocol, beginning by prompting for a filename(.DO ext 
        may be left off) 
   <F4> File: displays the filename directory, as in BASIC 
   <F5> Free: displays free RAM remaining, as in the MENU display 
   <F6> Scroll Lock Toggle: says 'Wait' when reception has been 
        stopped by the host (see Model 100 operating manual)
   <F7> CRC or CkSm: toggles between CRC (cyclic redundancy check: 
        a polynomial-generated 16-bit checksum) and regular 
        checksum mode...overridden by host request when sending 
        XMODEM.
   <F8> Norm: returns to normal terminal emulation mode 

2.2  Xmodem File Transfers

To send or receive with XMODEM protocol you must enter the XMODEM 
terminal mode by pressing F7 (Xmod).  Now you will see  "Send" 
(F2) and "Recv" (F3).  Before proceeding, the host (computer being
Sent to or Received from) must be at the point of waiting for the 
XMODEM transfer to begin.  It will either be awaiting a CRC or 
checksum request, or repeatedly sending same.  Pressing either F2 
or F3 will prompt for a filename (must be an ASCII file, i.e.,
.DO).  In the case of receiving, the file must not already exist.  
If it does, you will be asked if you want to erase it (this is 
different from the built-in ROM Download routine, which will 
erase your file without asking).  After this filename is entered, 
Send or Receive will automatically go on to completion or error, 
either of which beeps the buzzer.  In the case of error, it 
displays the cause of error and retry number (up to 10 times).
After a successful transfer it returns to XMODEM terminal mode. 

The Xmodem transfer can be used with any baud rate, word length, 
parity, number of stop bits, and flow control (Xon/Xoff enabled or
not) since it forces the setting to "x8N1D"(where 'x' is the baud 
rate <1-9 or M> you have set) during the transfer, then restores 
your previous settings when finished or aborted.  However, if the 
"RESET" button on the back of the model 100 is pressed during the 
transfer, the settings remain at "x8N1D". 


3. Use of Program Enhancements

3.1  Access to Text and BAsic while Online

Access to Text is by hitting SHIFT-F7 and SHIFT-F6 takes you to 
Basic.  To return from Text, use F8.  To return from Basic, do 
CALL HIMEM+19 -- assuming that XMDPW5.CO is the lowest (or only) 
CO program loaded in memory.  This can be facilitated by defining 
a function key in Basic as follows: 

        KEY6,"Term"+CHR$(24)+"CallXXXXX"+CHR$(13)

where XXXXX = TOP+19, top being the low address of the XMDPW5.CO. 

One caution: If you use a function key to return to Term from
Basic, make sure you zero the definition if XMDPW5.CO is removed 
from use.  Otherwise, hitting this key could be unfriendly!! 

3.2  Splitscreen Operation during Conferences

This program also includes James Yi's original split screen code 
developed for the Tandy 200.  It is very nice in online
conferences.  To toggle it, hit SHIFT-F1.  In Compuserve 
conferences, it also necessary to send the CIS command /NOECHO 
while in the COnference.  No similar command is needed on GEnie.

To toggle on the splitscreen mode, the label line MUST be on. To 
use a label line function, first do SHIFT-F1 to toggle SS to off, 
then do your thing, then use SHIFT-F1 to get SS back.  Other 
approaches work, but confuse. 

3.3  Macros

This program includes a macro routine.  To use it, go to TEXT and 
create a macro file named XMDMAC.DO.  The following is shows how 
to construct XMDMAC.DO.

           <1>This is the first macro to be sent.
           <2>This is the second macro, and is a 
           typical long and complex macro.  It can 
           include carriage returns, blank lines,
                      *************
                      *           *
                       *  O   O  *
                       *    ^    *
                       *   / \   *
                        *  ___  *
                         *     *
                          *   *
                           ***
           and can be used to send bizarre graphics 
           creations, so long as they have all ASCII 
           characters with ASCII value less than 128.
           <3>This is the third macro, another short 
           one.

Each macro must be started by a keystroke (denoted <1>, <2> and 
<3> above) with its ASCII value above 127; examples are CODE-D, 
CODE-d and GRPH-c -- each made by pressing the letter key while
holding down the corresponding special key (CODE or GRPH in the 
above).  The macro will continue until another such 
character is reached. 

To send a macro while on line, just hit the CODE or GRPH  key
(e.g., GRPH held while hitting the selected key). In fact, by
using XMDPW5 TEXT access, you can even edit your XMDMAC file while
on line!

3.4  Scroll Lock

By pressing F6 while in either the Xmodem Menu or the Normal Menu, 
the LCD scroll can be toggled.  Eliminating scroll will give 
faster operation, particularly for the Model 100 and Tandy 102.  
This mode is of limited benefit, since the screen is a mite 
difficult to read!  But it can be used in dumping messages (BBS) 
to a fast printer, or in capturing files to RAM.


4.  Conclusion

The XMDPW5 project has been a joint endeavor contributed to by a
number of programmers -- first and foremost J.R. Chenoweth who 
wrote the core program.
