      XP-HLP.CO  (c) 1992, R.W.Hess
      -----------------------------


XPTERM.CO includes a feature which permits the user to run any program named 
XPUSR.CO at any time, on or off-line, by simply pressing SHIFT/F8.  (See the 
DOCs for XPUSR.CO design parameters.)

XP-HLP.CO, when renamed as XPUSR.CO, gives XPTERM users a handy, 8-line 'help 
window' which instantly displays a chart of the normal and enhanced functions 
performed by XPTERM Function Keys 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 as well as 4 other 
XPTERM features.

XP-HLP is written to occupy less than 320 bytes of RAM, so its references to 
the Function Keys, their +SHIFT, +CTRL and +SHIFT/CTRL enhancements and other 
XPTRERM operations are necessarily brief REMINDERS and NOT detailed 
repetitions of the instructions contained in the DOCs.  If the reminder is TOO
 brief at first glance, refresh your memory by studying the DOCs before using 
XPTERM: then XP-HLP.CO should be all you need.

The chart will look like this when run by either cursor selection from the 
main menu or by pressing XPTERM's SHIFT/F8.  The display pauses for any 
keypress and returns to 'where run': XPTERM or Main Menu.  (<PRINT> can be 
used to copy the chart to a printer.)


  KEY      +SHIFT   +CTRL   +SHIFT/CTRL
F1  Prev    Scroll
F4  Duplx   Baud
F5  Echo    Add LF   FrmFd
F6  Dial    last     last+1  loop
F7  Edit    last
F8  Ex/Hg   XPUSR
 NUM chks  SHIFT/BREAK aborts op  :;Dsk


The keys and functions shown under "KEY" are invoked by simply pressing the 
key itself.  The ENHANCED functions are invoked by pressing the indicated 
function key SIMULTANEOUSLY with the SHIFT and/or CTRL keys.  (Keys not 
listed, F2 & F3, have no enhanced functions associated with them.)

The F1, F4, F5 and F8 enhancements are 'additional' features of XPTERM 
function keys and therefore begin with capital letters.  The F6 and F7 
enhancements, however, work as 'extensions' of those keys and are shown in 
small letters.

Example: F6 "Dial" waits for you to input a phone number, then dials it.
         SHIFT/F6 "Dial last" dials the last number pointed to by the
          cursor in the last edited .DO file.


"NUM chks"
Refers to XPTERM's "echo error checking" available for ASCII, non-Xmodem .DO 
file uploads.  If NUM is locked during uploading, then data sent is compared 
with data 'echoed' and any data that doesn't match is printed in reverse 
video.

"SHIFT/BREAK aborts op"
Indicates that use of this key set will abort almost all XPTERM operations and
 remain in XPTERM.

":;Dsk"
Reminds you of the prefixes for Disk files:
    ":" (colon) for Directory "1", TDD1 and TDD2
    ";" (semi-colon) for Directory "2", TDD2


      INITIAL SET-UP
      --------------

 - Use XPTERM and CIS' Xmodem protocol to DOWNLOAD the appropriate binary 
program file from the DLs: XP-HLP.200 for the T200 in DL10 and XP-HLP.100 for 
the M100/102 in DL3.  These are 'ready to run' ".CO" programs so be sure to 
specify ".CO" as the download target file extension.  (They can ONLY be 
downloaded into your computer using XPTERM's direct, Xmodem, binary file 
transfer capability.)

 - Back-up your copy of XP-HLP.CO to some other media as XP-HLP.CO.
    (This permits storage as one of probably many "XPUSR" files.)

 - For use with XPTERM, XP-HLP.CO must be renamed XPUSR.CO.  Then, whenever 
SHIFT/F8 is pressed , XPUSR (XP-HLP) will run automatically and display the 
'help window'.
