Instructions for ENTEL.RK
=========================


GENERAL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

     ENTEL.RK is a short (542 b) utility which enhances Telcom's Terminal mode,
permitting entry to Basic, easy transfer of ASCII files between RAM and a 
diskette, and quick return to TERM - without losing the phone line or your 
place in the CIS file. You can download and upload text of ANY length, 
regardless of the available RAM. Intended for the DVI, ENTEL.RK should work 
with any drive or cassette recorder accessible from Basic.

     The program essentially consists of two parts.

1)   The first part, the POKE and KEY statements in line 1, redefines three 
function keys, as follows:
- Telcom/Term F6 key will give Free RAM
- Telcom/Term F7 key will take you to BASIC
- Basic F5 key will take you from Basic directly to TELCOM

2)   The second part, in lines 2-5, is a very short general file transfer 
subroutine, capable of transferring ASCII text between RAM and any peripheral 
storage device, depending on the specified filename prefix (e.g. 0: 1: CAS: 
MDM: COM: LPT:)

     You need the program whenever you wish to download a file larger than your
RAM, upload text larger than your RAM, upload text which just doesn't happen to
be in RAM at the time, or when you need to run a Basic program without losing 
the phone connection.



USING THE PROGRAM
-----------------

     Load the program into BASIC. Unless you plan to run other Basic programs 
while on-line, it is more convenient NOT to save ENTEL as a .BA file.

1) INITIALIZATION:

     Run the program once in order to set the new function key definitions 
BEFORE entering TELCOM. This is also a good opportunity to attempt file 
transfer. Load a short text into a RAM file called "PAGE-1.DO". Press the F4 
key in Basic to run the program, and the prompt "Source File...... : " appears.
Type in "PAGE-1" in capital or small letters and press <ENTER>. The second 
prompt "Destination File : " now appears. Let's say you want to save this text 
on a diskette in drive 0, in a file called "DUMP-1". Type in "0:DUMP-1", press 
the <ENTER> key, and the update "Working..." appears. When file transfer is 
completed, you will be notified by a beep and the following message:

- You are still in Basic...
- F5 for TELCOM, then F4 for TERMINAL
- [Break] if disconnected

     At this point your function keys are defined. From now on you may go 
directly to TELCOM and make use of ENTEL without initializing. Repeat the 
process only after a cold start or after programs which change these function 
key definitions.

     Incidentally, you do NOT have to enter filenames in response to prompts 
while initializing. Instead just hit the <ENTER> key.

2) USING THE PROGRAM IN THE TERMINAL MODE:

     In the TERM mode, your F6 key will print on the screen the amount of free 
RAM - the equivalent of FRE(0) in Basic. While downloading, all but 192 bytes 
are reserved for string space. So, press the F6 key BEFORE starting to 
download. Then, for each minute of downloading you will be losing about 2250 
bytes of free RAM.

     Now, let us assume you wish to download a 60K file with a 24K machine. 
This will have to be done in 4 sections of 15K each. You will download into a 
RAM file called "PAGE.DO" and save the text on a diskette in drive 0, in files 
called "PAGE-1" through "PAGE-4". Start downloading the first section. After 
about 7 minutes follow the protocol below.

(a) Press ^S (CTRL S) to stop the sender from delivering data.
(b) Press the F7 key to take you to BASIC.
(c) If ENTEL is already loaded in BASIC go to step (d). If you have ENTEL 
stored in RAM as a .BA file then LOAD "ENTEL" and press <ENTER>
(d) Press the F4 key to RUN ENTEL. Free RAM is displayed in the right upper 
corner.
(e) In response to the prompt "Source File..... : ", type in PAGE and <ENTER>.
(f) In response to the prompt "Destination File : ", type in 0:PAGE-1 and press
the <ENTER> key. When the transfer is completed you will hear a beep and get 
the following instructions:
   - You are still in Basic...
   - F5 for TELCOM, then F4 for TERMINAL
   - [Break] if disconnected
You may at this point run ENTEL again to save or load other files.
(g) To return to TELCOM, press the F5 key. The usual TELCOM prompt should 
appear on the screen.
(h) Press the F4 key to return to the TERMINAL mode. Wait several seconds 
observing the Label line. The change in the Label line is the only indication 
you have successfully returned to TERM. Expect no new text on the screen. Your 
sender is still on hold.
(h) Press the F2 key to start downloading again into the SAME RAM file as 
before (PAGE). Opening this file for input will clear all previous text from 
memory.
(i) Type in ^Q to instruct your sender to resume sending new data.

     You may repeat the process as often as necessary.



LIMITATIONS:
------------

     Once the F7 key (Terminal mode) takes you to Basic, you must remain in 
Basic until return to the Terminal mode. You may run any Basic program you 
wish, or do what you will, but entering the Main Menu disconnects your 
telephone line (with NO other complications).



>>> WARNINGS <<<
----------------

- USE COMPLETE FILENAMES:   To access files on peripheral storage devices, the 
COMPLETE filename must be entered in response to prompts, using the usual 
format:
     device prefix:filename.extension
     Example:   0:PAGE.DO
For RAM files, you may omit the prefix (RAM:) and the extension (.DO)

- DO NOT RUN OUT OF RAM:   to operate ENTEL requires about 1.4K for string 
space and file buffers. Stop downloading, when about 3K of free RAM is left, 
and check the memory with the F6 key. If you do not have at least 1.4K, you can
not use ENTEL (see below) and must disconnect.

- AVOID PROGRAM ERRORS:   Program errors result in computer lockup. An error 
trapping subroutine does NOT help and is not included. So, here are a few 
DON'Ts:
     Don't try to save or load nonexistent files (remember the extensions).
     Don't forget to connect the peripheral you need.
     Don't leave the drive latch in the up position.
     Don't run out of RAM.
     Don't use a full diskette.
     Don't run any programs in Basic which end in MENU.
If you experience a lockup, try the [Break] key first. If that doesn't work - 
it never worked for me - press the RESET key ONCE. That works just fine, but 
you lose the phone connection and, on occasion, you get a cold start.



MODIFYING THE PROGRAM
-----------------------
- Substitute the Basic F5 key definition of CALL 20806 (line 1) with CALL 21589
to take you from Basic directly to the TERMINAL MODE
- Substitute CLEAR 256:MAXFILES=0 (line 6) with CLOSE.
