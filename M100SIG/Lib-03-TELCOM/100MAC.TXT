My search for how to operate a Macintosh with the Radio Shack Model 100 laptop 
has ended!

The literature seemed to say that a Model 100 plugged into the Imagewriter 
cable instead of the printer was all the connection you needed. If you did 
that, the two machines could send files to each other using the 100s built-in 
telecom software and any one of the MACs communication applications. I was not 
interested in continually disconnecting the printer plug. I instead obtained 
another Imagewriter cable and an A/B box so I could just switch the printer to 
my 100 connector. Sounds great? It didn't work!

I fussed and poked at all of the machinery trying all kinds of combinations. I 
just couldn't get files to transfer in either direction, least of all to hit 
either of the two keyboards and have letters jump out on the screens.

I searched the CIS Data Libraries and found the following:

    In the Model 100 Sig (PCS-154), DL 3, two files.
       
       *MAC100.TXT         *CABLE.MAC

    In the Mac Sig (MACUS), DL 14, two files.

       *LAPTOP.MAC         *MAC100.BIN

Guess what? CABLE.MAC and LAPTOP.MAC talk about remaking the Imagewriter cable 
to get the system to function. MAC100.TXT and MAC100.BIN tell you to plug the 
Model 100 and a standard Imagewriter cable into the MODEM port of the MAC, not 
the printer port. So I tried it. It worked like a charm! And I didn't have to 
remake anything.

There seems to be so much seemingly contradictory advice on this subject that I
thought writing it all down was the best solution. Good luck.
