RLETIP:  Files containing CHR$(127)
 
   A problem exists with some RLE picture files in that they contain a DELete 
character (CHR$(127)).  A Model 100 text file cannot contain DEL characters, so 
they are not put into the computer's files during downloading.  The resulting 
file looks mainly like gibberish when the computer tries to redisplay the 
picture, even if it looked good online using PIXTEL.  There is a way to restore 
most of the DELs in a file by replacing them with an equivalent character 
sequence such as "4 k".  Since 99% of DELs appear just before a space, the 
following program will correct most, if not all, of the errors in these files:
 
5 MAXFILES=2:FILES:INPUT"Filename to process";FI$
10 OPENFI$FORINPUTAS1:OPENLEFT$(FI$,5)+"2"FOROUTPUTAS2
30 A$=INPUT$(1,1):IFA$=" "THENPRINT#2,"4 k";:PRINT"+";
40 PRINT#2,A$;:IFNOTEOF(1)THEN30ELSEBEEP:PRINT"Done":CLOSE
 
In a file to be corrected, spaces would normally all be preceded by a DEL except
in one case.  If the pixel in the top left corner is white, a space should 
appear directly after the ^[GH or ^[GM at the beginning of the file.  If this is
the case, remove the first "4 k" in TEXT mode so that the space which follows 
appears directly after the H or M.  You'll be able to recognize such a file 
because it will display reversed (negative) and the right half will appear on 
the left and vice versa.
   The one case in 95 where there should be a DEL in the file not followed by a 
space is where there are exactly 95 pixels of the same colour in a row (which 
may wrap around to the next line).  The problem is that this can occur several 
times in a file.  I think there is a way that many of these files can be 
salvaged too, but I'll have to work on that a bit.  Meanwhile try the above 
routine on some files (just copy and paste into Basic) and let me know the 
results.
   The following bad files I have successfully corrected using the short 
routine: GARF02, SKUNK, TAJMAH, CKECLS.  The following will need further 
processing: GARF01, COKE, SBRACE.  All of these are available in the PICS forum.

   Send the results of your tests to Neil Wick [71056,613].  Give the name of 
the file and what the results were.  Thank-you.
   P.S. It seems that Commodore 64s are one of the main sources for these self-
corrupting files, but I believe some ColorComputer files may also have the 
problem.  Weather maps are always okay.
