        Documentation for UNIXV.100, a terminfo listing to allow use
        of the Model 100 as a terminal with System V UNIX systems.
        For System V, AT&T uses a small file to describe a particular
        terminal, rather than an entry in a huge /etc/termcap file.
        This terminfo has been tested on an AT&T 3B2 and a 6300 PLUS,
        and has been derived from TERMCP.100.

        To compile the terminfo, copy UNIXV.100 to a file with a "t"
        extension, like m100.t. Then issue the command:

                        tic -v m100.t

        You must be root or superuser to create a terminfo file.

        To use a 200 or the DVI, change the name on the first line,
        and the line and column information.  Be sure the name does
        not refer to an existing terminal.

        Function keys are simulated by pressing <ESC> then the number
        that corresponds to the key, such as <ESC>2 for F2.  You have
        to be reasonably quick about the sequence.

        The basic definitions I can recall: (by line)

        Auto margin (wrap), use xon-xoff, ?, ? (Can't remember),
        Screen size,
        Bell, Carriage Return, New line,
        Index (scroll one line up), Reverse index,
        Cursor movement: up, down, forward, back,
        Keys: up, down, forward, back, backspace,
        Standout (reverse video), Remove standout,
        Cursor invisible, Normal,
        Erase to end of: display, line,
        Insert line, Delete line,
        Home, Clear, Cursor position (added to a <SPACE> or dec. 32),
        Function key simulation.

        I do not like reverse video on the DVI with a TV, and delete
        the standout line in that file.  You will have to use a
        separate file for a 100 and a DVI, as there is a bug in tic
        that does not let you refer to an existing terminal.  I have a
        dvi and dvi40 description, for 80 and 40 column displays.

        The only bug I know of is occasional garbage characters with
        vi at above 4800 baud.  Use <CTRL> L to redraw the screen.
        Since most people will use a 100 only long enough to transfer
        files back and forth over a serial line, I do not consider it
        a major problem.  Everything is fine at 300 or 1200 baud,
        although I would suggest setting noredraw in vi at 300.

        I set up my .profile to execute a tty command and if I am
        using a modem port, export m100 as TERM, then copy my model 100
        .exrc file in.  I have noredraw and wrapmargin=0 set for the 40
        column screen. Otherwise, I export a default terminal, and
        copy in a .exrc file with redraw and wrapmargin=10.

        I did this about a year ago, and should have posted it then.
        I am posting it now (along with my ramblings) because my 6300
        did not have documentation for tic.
