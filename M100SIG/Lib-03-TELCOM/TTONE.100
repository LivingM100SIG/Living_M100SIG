Well, the controvery is settled.  Tone dialing on the Model 200 is no faster
than pulse dialing with the Model 100 at 20 pps...

I timed them both with a stopwatch today.  The 200 has about a five second
delay before it get's going, while the 100 has only a 2 second delay.  End
result:  It takes both computers 12 seconds to actually access the phone
exchange from the time you press the ENTER key.

Not, in getting through to the modem tone, but just 'til the first "ring"
that's echoed to your receiver.

So, tone dialing would not be worth the added cost, whether by modification, or
external accessory.

The ability to use the M100 with Sprint or MCI would still be worth it to me! 
THAT is the important aspect of the problem, not speed.  I am also finding that
the 20pps speed is riddled with errors as was my first impression.
  I still crave tone dialing and you will be hard pressed to convince me I
don't...Dave

This message will be out of sequence, but grabbed your PPN from an RS;S;TONE
command....

This message is being sent in via Reno, Nevada, through MCI service. You're
right, it does work, But, you have to put a lot of = signs in the phone number
for it to work.  You need a delay between your local access # and your personal
code number, then again between the personal code and the area code of the
number you're dialing.  Total of 6 in the first c case, 3 in the latter; for
me, anyway. Phone number looks like this:

7952333======00000===7027865308.

Dialing time: 31 seconds from press of ENTER key to ringing of CIS node in
Reno.  But, you're right, it DOES work.


Don't recall you SAYING it worked, but something about that's why you wanted
it.  So my test verified that it works, and your reason for wanting tone
dialing for the M100 was valid.  It WILL work.

In my particular situation I have a Demon Dialer that dials the local Sprint
access number and my ID number.  I'd like to be able to then have the M100 dial
the number I am trying to call.  Can you figure out a way to do that?...Dave


Fm: Asysop Tony Anderson 70506,1261

Yes, I think so... since you are locked into a M100 without tone capability,
and since your Sprint service requires tones for input, how about getting one
of those handy-dandy pocket dialers that R/S sells, and mount it on a box with
phone input and output plugs.  Wire it so the dialer is across the tip and ring
phone lines, And put the required number sequence in the dialers memory.  Maybe
delete the phone number from ADRS file, and substitute = signs, then the logon
sequence.

Find CIS (or whatever you find), and press "Call", then hit the auto-dial on
the dialer for Sprint, Access #, and CIS #.  By the time you connect, TELCOM
should be ready to send the auto logon sequence.  (May need to be restructured
to wait before sending ^C.

You are overcomplicating my problem.  What I need to do is hit the dialer for
the Sprint Log-on sequence the have the M100 dial in the number.  Rather Before
I add anothe component I'll use my finger, at least that's always with me.  I
just want the M100 to tone dial that's all <WIMPEwimper>...Dave


Fm: Asysop Tony Anderson 70506,1261

Yes, Dave, it works.  You can eliminate the number to be dialed in the auto
logon sequence in the ADRS file, and tone dial it yourself, either with the
phone, or a dialer.  Use 5 or 6 = signs instead of the phone number.  Use this
format:

TEST:======<^C?D70506,1261^M... etc.

Go into TELCOM, find TEST, and press F2 for Call (or the ENTER key), then
immediately dial your numbers via touchtone.  You may have to experiment how
many = signs to put in so that you get the modem connect tone by the time the
M100 sends the CTRL-C.

I ONLY need this capability for voice lines all auto log-ons work just fine. 
The Demon Dialer does everything the little dialer you are talking about does
and maybe more, don't know for sure haven't looked at one...Dave
