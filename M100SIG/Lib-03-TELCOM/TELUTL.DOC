      DOCUMENTATION FOR TELUTL.100

      This SIG has helped me tremendously in learning about my Model 100
so here's a small THANK YOU. This is a utility I created out of bits and
pieces from a variety of programs downloaded from this SIG. I hope I
have not missed any acknowledgements. It takes 1631 bytes as a BA file and
was created to recall various routines from BASIC  WITHOUT going through the
MENU and hanging up the modem while ON-LINE: one of its best features lets
you interupt a data session while on-line, run Basic programs and return
on-line without having lost the carrier.


F1) Comm:  Puts you ON-LINE directly to the terminal mode.

F2) Tlcm:  Calls the TELCOM program directly. (Use this when making data
calls because of the Fkey setup routines explained later.)

F3) Apnd:  Integrates APPEND.BA by Tony Anderson (DL7) into this menu.
Great for combining files while on-line.

F4) Byte:  From FILEN2.100 by ?? (Dl7); Use to figure out where all the
Bytes went, on-line or off.

F5) Link:  An adaptation of ENTEL.RK by Rudy Kokich. This was the source
for many of the ideas in this program. Once you've paused incoming data with
^S select this program to dump the "Down"ed file to cassette. Exits to
Utility Menu.

F6)  Bsic:  Simply takes you directly to BASIC without passing MENU and
turns on the label line.

F7)  Disk:  Calls the routine for accessing your disk system. I've used
the address where DSKMGR v3.02 by J.K.Heilman lives in my M100. Edit
line 330 to YOUR needs. (LOAD"XXXX",R  works fine for any RAM resident
program.)

F8) Menu:  BE CAREFUL with this one when "Off-Line" while on-line. It
takes you to the M100 regular menu but unavoidably hangs up the modem!


      Two of the routines from ENTEL.RK have been incorporated in this utility
to reprogram the normally unused TELCOM keys F6 and F7 (really the
heart of the whole idea!). While in TELCOM F6 will give you Free RAM (if
used during "down"load though you'll only get 199 since TELCOM reserves
everything else for use). TELCOM F7 will now take you from TELCOM directly
to Basic WITHOUT hanging up the modem. Once there F8 will load the Utility
Menu and away you go.
      This program redefines Basic-F8 to reload this program if stored in
RAM as T.BA. Try it, I think you'll like it.

      It works like this:
           --First time--
      Download TELUTL.100 and weed out all the extra stuff; then edit
whatever lines you need to, load and Save in RAM as T.BA. Then from main
M100 menu select T.BA and enter.
           --Subsequent uses--
      Run T.BA from main menu by cursor selection or from Basic by F8. Make
all calls by selecting Tlcm and running TELCOM as usual. To use
subroutines while on line: 1) stop data flow either with a ^S or wait for
a prompt; 2) press F7 and wait for Basic to display; 3) press F8 to load
T.BA; 4) run whatever routines you need remembering NOT to call M100 Menu
or make any Basic errors.(reset is then the only solution)

One more addition you can make if you want to remove Addrss & Schedl from
M100 menu: add to line 5.

(call them from Menu by typing in their filenames instead)

THANKS AGAIN TO ALL OF YOU! Please send me comments or suggestions or
