                                  WHAT IS EM8SIG ?


           EM8SIG.100 vers 4.0 is a fully configured and function key driven
        program offering fully automated composing, sending, and receiving of
        both CompuServe EasyPlex mail and Forum (Sig) messages.

           Designed for both the occasional novice user and the experienced
        high tech volume user, it saves time and $$$$$$.

           Permission is hereby granted for the posting of EM8SIG.100 and its
        associated files on private, not-for-profit BBS's; provided however,
        any distribution of this program and/or its associated documents is
        made free of charge to any individuals who desire it and all
        duplications contain -all- the program code and associated
        information files with no deletions or changes.


                                 EM8SIG version 4.0
                                 ------------------

                      Auto-EasyPlex                 Auto-Forum

           EM8SIG.400 is an all new version of EM8SIG. The program is now
        capable of performing all SIG functions without taking a mandatory
        detour through the Email system. This is handy if you have picked up
        your Email and Sig messages in an earlier session and are responding
        only to Sig business. In version 3.0 & 3.1, the program forced you to
        check for Email. A few of the menus have been reworked.

           EM8SIG is now about 650 bytes smaller. The new, svelte EM8SIG
        gives you more room to download message header scans and message
        threads without resorting to ram banks or cassette tape.


                                  HISTORY OF EM8SIG


           The program EM8SIG.100 was originally conceived by the late Marvin
        M. Miller who supported it and constantly upgraded it until his
        untimely death in late 1987. Up until almost the time of his death he
        was considering further improvements in the program to take into
        account the wishes of the many users such as the ability to bypass
        the EasyPlex section and go directly to a desired forum. When in 1988
        it was determined that because of recent changes in CIS, particularly
        as they related to the Forums, EM8SIG would no longer be usable a
        campaign was begun to upgrade EM8 to work with the new format. Stan
        Wong undertook to revise Marvin's original program, first with some
        merges to version 3.0, which became version 3.1, and then a complete
        revamping of the program which became the present version 4.0. In the
        latest version, Stan has incorporated many of the changes Marvin had
        been considering. It is to this latest version that this
        documentation is directed, and is the only one currently being
        supported on this forum.

                             WHAT DOES THE PROGRAM DO ?


           EM8SIG.400 saves $$$ and provides a convenient, one-stroke, fully
        automated, high speed method to:

                  o  Prepare Email and Forum messages off-line,

                  o  Supports multiple addressee Email,

                  o  Unattended operation,  auto-log onto CIS at preset times
                     when phone rates are low, send/receive messages, and
                     then auto-logoff,

                  o  Redial if busy signal is encountered,

                  o  Supports a variety of M100 peripheral devices such as -
                     Chipmunk disk drive - RAM banks - Cassette tape -
                     Printer

                  o  Keeps record of CIS charges.

           EM8SIG.400 is menu driven. "Quick start" function key operation is
        also supported bypassing the menus.

                                    INSTALLATION


            Download to RAM EM8SIG.400 as EM8SIG.D0. Check the DO version and
        delete all excess information at the beginning and end of the
        program. The program begins with the line:

            0 GOTO17'EM8SIG.100ver4.0 Copyright (c) 1988 by Stan Wong
            70346,1267--based on ver3.0 copyrightMMMiller:75665,312:5/09/87

        and ends with the line:

            500 CALL21586

            Return to MENU. Enter BASIC. Press F2. You will see the word
        LOAD". Type EM8SIG and press <ENTER>. You will see the flashing word
        "WAIT" as the program loads into basic. When you see the OK prompt,
        press F3. You will see the word SAVE". Type EM8SIG again and press
        <ENTER>. At the OK prompt, return to MENU and you will see EM8SIG.DO
        and EM8SIG.BA. Place the curser over EM8SIG.BA and press <ENTER>. If
        the program has loaded correctly you should now see the opening
        banner. As soon as it has completed its run you will see the first
        screen which asks if you wish to review your options. For now just
        press F8 and return to MENU. Enter BASIC again and type
        KILL"EM8SIG.DO and press <ENTER>. At the OK prompt return to MENU
        again. Make a copy of EM8SIG to either tape or disk.


        PERSONALIZING/GETTING STARTED ******************************

            Before using EM8SIG.400, the user MUST personalize the program.
        This is done by selecting the Option Menus located at the beginning
        of the program.


            THE ONLY WAY THE USER SHOULD MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM IS
            BY USE OF THESE MENU(s) UNLESS DIRECTED OTHERWISE.


            Read the following instructions which will take you through the
        necessary actions screen by screen. Additional information is
        contained in APPENDIX A.


        NOTE: Because it is impossible for me to give you an EXACT copy of
              your screen in the following pages I will give you the
              information you will see on each screen as best I can. Some of
              the lines are in reverse video or white characters on a black
              background. However, the information is the same.


             On the main M100/102 MENU, place the curser over EM8SIG and
        press <ENTER>. After the Opening Banner has run you will see Screen
        Number 1. Turn to the next page.
