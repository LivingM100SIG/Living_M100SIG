	 	ENHANCED VERSION OF XMD100.CO.

Credit to J R Chenoweth for the original machine language XMODEM program, 
XMD100.CO -- the only one in the DL's allowing error-checked transfers that 
take advantage of superspeed modems.

XMODEM programs written in BASIC may be fine at 300 bps, but they can't keep up
at 2400 baud.  Compare:


		  6985 byte XMODEM download
		    CIS connect at 2400 baud

		  XMDM26.BA	 3:04
		  XMD100.CO  	  :58


But XMD100 has a couple of drawbacks: a reputation for being "buggy," and a 
failure to allow high-speed normal (non-XMODEM or "capture") transfers.  They 
are limited to about 600 baud because the M100 interrupts data flow while it 
sloooowly scrolls its screen.

PCHXMD fixes the latter problem by setting F6 as a toggle, to turn scrolling on
and off, in the TERM mode.

I'm not familiar with all the bug reports, but personal experience has shown 
the program to work well -- once you manage to install it.  I had persistent 
difficulties using LOAD.BA to convert XMD100.HEX.  I downloaded the hex file 
twice; and despite proper checksums, it would not produce a bug-free version of
the .CO program.  I finally went to XMD26, downloaded the hex file with XMODEM 
protocol, and got it to work.

To help avoid those problems, PCHXMD.HEX is designed for conversion with 
CHANGE.BA -- which includes internal checksumming of the code it installs.

Note that you must run PCHXMD.CO with a basic "driver" program -- listed as 
PCHXMD.DRV in the same DL.  With comments removed, it is about 50 bytes.  If 
you re-locate the main program, you'll have to change the poke values in the 
driver (see "Nasty stuff," below).

You should consult the original author's XMD100.DOC for instructions on the 
main body of the program.  I don't know if the author is still present on the 
SIG, but I'll try to lend whatever support I can.

Step-by-step instructios to run:
  1.  Download PCHXMD.HEX, PCHXMD.DRV, bnd XMD100.DOC files from DL3.  You'll 
also need CHANGE.BA and its documentation from DL_, if you don't already have 
them.
  2.  Use CHANGE.BA to convert PCHXMD.HEX4to PCHXMD.CO (the file name expected 
by the driver program).
  3.  Strip PCHXMD.DRV to the bare essentials and install it as PCHXMD.BA, or 
whatever you choose to call it.
  4.  Use the .BA file to run the .CO program, per instructions from XMD100.DOC
-- with the new feature of an F6 key that toggles screen scrolling off and on.

Nasty stuff: This program looks like it uses RAM from 59381 to 62285.  In fact,
it uses memory all the way to MAXRAM for variables and buffering.  I don't know
if this "extra" space is absolute (keeps the same location, wherever you put 
the main program) or relative (changes address if you relocate the main file). 
So be prepared for the worst if you try installing this BELOW other m/l 
programs.

Nice stuff:  Most of all, you'll save money.  I used to spend about 30 minutes 
a day on CIS (mostly on this SIG), reading messages at 300 baud, then 
selectively re-reading them for download if I wanted the contents.  Now I do a 
2400 baud no-scroll download of an entire day's messages in less than 3 
minutes.  In the DL's, I used to "capture" stuff and hope for no transmission 
glitches.  Now, I let XMODEM do the driving and know I'm getting what's really 
there.
  In addition, with an external modem, this program will let you go back into 
the M100's main menu and use BASIC and  TEXT without breaking the connection to
a host.  Simply run the driver program again (or CALL HIMEM+20 from BASIC) and 
hit the TERM key to get back on-line.  I've even pulled the modem's RS232 cable
out of the M100, attached the TDD cable, moved a file to disc (using TS-DOS on 
ROM), and swapped cables again without a disconnect.

What's missing:  Auto-dial and auto-logon.  I hope to add those, when time 
permits, either as a supplement to the driver program or as a "patch to the 
patch" in assembly.
