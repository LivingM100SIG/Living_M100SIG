
   It's really difficult to imagine easier file transfer between different 
machines than can be accomplished between Tandy's M100 and Apple's Macintosh.  
No special hardware or software is needed for the M100.  For the Mac, you'll 
need a communications package (I use Apple's MacTerminal) and an Imagewriter 
printer cable.  To connect the machines, unplug the printer cable from the back
of the Imagewriter and plug it into the M100's RS-232 port.  Then move the Mac 
end of the cable from the printer port to Mac's modem port.  You're done!  No 
ribbon cables or null modems required.  What could be simplier?  (Ans:  It 
would be simplier if you could just leave the Mac end of the cable in the 
printer port.  MacTerminal lets you do just that by allowing output to be sent 
through either serial port. However, for baud rates above 1200, the MacTerminal
documentation recommendes using the modem port.) 
 
   To transfer files, the communications parameters for both machines should be
identical.  I set the status in TELCOM to 97I1E, which means a transfer rate of
19200 baud, a 7 bit word  length, parity is ignored, the stop bit is set to 1, 
and XON/XOFF is enabled.  The same settings are made on the Mac with 
MacTerminal.
 
   Before beginning, one further detail must be attended to on the M100.  You 
must POKE 63066,1 to have line feeds sent from the M100 with carriage returns. 
Otherwise, the Mac will receive a single line, repeatedly overwritten.
 
   After the machines are connected, the M100 is placed in the Term mode of 
TELCOM, MacTerminal is booted on the Mac, and the communications parameters are
synchronized.  You're then ready to transfer ASCII files in either direction.  
At this point, anything typed on either keyboard should appear on the other's 
screen.  If you are in Half Duplex mode in Term and have set "Echo ON" in 
MacTerm, you'll see what is typed on both screens.  With Full Duplex and "Echo 
OFF" set, keystrokes are transmitted but not repeated on the originator's 
screen.
 
   To transfer from the M100 to Mac, (1) press F3 (Up) from Term on the M100, (
2) enter the name of any .DO file in memory at the "File to Upload?" prompt, 
and (3)  enter the desired number of characters between carrage returns at the 
"Width" prompt.  (If "Enter" is pressed with no number, then no extra carrage 
returns will be inserted into the text.) The transfer will then take place at 
19200 baud.  If MacTerminal is set to capture the file on disk, then the 
effective baud rate is limited by the Mac's drive.  A nice feature of TELCOM is
that it word wraps each outgoing line at the "Width" selected, so there are no 
broken words in the received file.
 
   An alternate method, not requiring TELCOM, is to (1) select the .DO file to 
be transferred from the M100 Menu, (2) press F3 (Save) and enter COM:97I1E at 
the "Save to:" prompt.  This will transmit the file out the RS-232 port with 
only the carriage returns contained in the text.  This method does not require 
POKE 63066,1 to get line feeds.  However, the received file may have broken 
words at line ends since a word wrap is not used.  (Word wrap can be achieved 
by "pre-processing" the text with a text editor, like WORPRO, which can insert 
carrage returns in the proper places.)
 
   To go from the Mac to M100, you again can either use TELCOM or not.  To use 
TELCOM, (1) press F2(Down) from Term and at the "File to Download?" prompt 
enter a legal M100 file name, and then (2) transmit the file from MacTerminal. 
   When the transfer is complete toggle F2 again to close the M100 capture 
buffer.  
   Alternatively, you can (1) open a new .DO file on the M100, (2) press F2(
Load) and at the "Load from:" prompt enter COM:97I1E, then (3) transmit the 
file from MacTerminal as before.  I personally prefer using TELCOM because I 
can see the file as it comes across the M100 screen.  
 
   That's all there is to it.  Good luck!

Tony, The recent messages regarding file transfer between Mac and Model
100/102 motivated me to recheck the file transfer information in Library 3. 
In tests with a Tandy 102, a Mac Plus with Versa Term Pro,  and a
modem/printer cable for the Mac, I found that a Null Modem is indeed necessary
for successful file transfer.  This is contrary to the directions in
MAC100.TXT and LAPMAC.THD in Lib. 3.

The following setup worked to send files from the T102 to the Mac: Mac modem
port -> Image Writer cable -> Null Modem -> T102 RS-232C port.  T102 Telcom
settings were 98N1E.  The Mac's Versa Term  Pro settings were 19200 bd, 8
Bits, No parity, 1 stop bit.  The files could be uploaded by using F3 either
in Telcom, where it means "UPLOAD", or in the Text file where it means "SAVE
TO:".  If I left out the Null Modem as recommended in the above Library 3
files, nothing was transferred.  The Telcom route was preferred because its
request for line width allowed one to avoid words being split as line wrapping
occurred at the Mac end.

Transfers from the Mac to the Tandy gave errors at the above baud rate and I
used settings of 600 bd, 8 bits, No parity, 1 stop bit on the Mac and 48N1E on
the T102.

If anybody has had problems following the recommendations in Library 3, they
should try adding a Null Modem to the procedure. Sean Dwyer
