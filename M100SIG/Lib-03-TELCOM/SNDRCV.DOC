cpmsnd

cpmsnd allows easy transfer of text files between the model 100 and most
CP/M based systems.  In addition, the
programs snd100.com and rcv100.com are
provided for the CP/M system

snd100 and rcv100 must first be
configured for the CP/M implementation.
This requires that the iobyte be
implemented in the BIOS and that it be
possible to redirect console i/o to the
rs232 interface.  First determine from
the system documentation the correct
value of the iobyte to redirect the
console to the rs232.  Only the low
two bits are significant to snd100 and
rcv100.  Put snd100.com, rcv100.com and
sndrcv.sub on the B: disk and DDT.COM,
SUBMIT.COM, and XSUB.COM on the A:
disk.  Type the command

	submit b:sndrcv <iobyte>

where <iobyte> is the proper value of
the iobyte for redirection of console
to the rs232.

To transfer files, first set the rs232
interface to the proper data rate,
number of stop bits and parity.  CPMSND
assumes 1200 baud, 8 bits, no parity.
Connect the model 100 to the CP/M
with the proper cable.

To transfer from the model 100 to CP/M,
first enter the command

	rcv100 <filename> e

on the CP/M system.  The "e" is
optional.  If present, the file will be
echoed on the screen.  After the
message "Ready to receive" is
displayed, run SNDCPM.BA on the model
100.  You will be prompted for the file
to send (must be a text (.DO) file) and
for the output file (default
COM:58n1e).

NOTE:	The file must be small enough
	to fit in memory on the CP/M
	system.

NOTE:	The file to send may be a
	cassette file.

To send a file from the CP/M system to
the model 100, first execute the proper
command on the model 100 to receive.
For BASIC programs, you may use a
comand such as

	load "com:58n1e"

in basic or may use the file load
function (F) of TEXT.

On the CP/M system enter the
command

	snd100 <filename> e

where "e" is optional and indicates
the file is to be echoed to the screen
as it is sent
