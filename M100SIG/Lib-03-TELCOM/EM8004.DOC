        PASSWORD. You will be asked to type your old password. You must type
        it exactly the way it is. If you are correct you will be asked for
        your new PASSWORD. And then to be sure there are no errors, you will
        be asked to type it again. If the change is successful you will be
        told so by CIS. Don't forget to change it in your log-on sequence in
        your ADRS.DO file as well.

            When you enter a PASSWORD at CIS it is encoded by their mainframe
        and not even the CIS employees have access to it. When you are
        logging-on using EM8SIG your PASSWORD will not appear on the screen
        as it is transmitted. However, of necessity, it IS in your ADRS.DO
        file. Anyone with a minor knowledge of computers could see it by
        accessing that file. If you only use EM8SIG in the privacy of your
        own home, you will probably never have any problem with this.
        However, if you regularly use EM8SIG.400 from an office, or while on
        the road, you might want to consider storing ADRS.DO on disk or tape
        rather than leaving it in RAM. Another point to consider is that
        there are some excellent encryption programs in library 4 of the
        M100SIG.


                                   LOG ON SEQUENCE

            Now back to the Log-On Sequence again. Let's take it apart and
        see what it does.

            CIS is the identifier, or CIS2, or DAL, which ever you choose.
        The next series of numbers is the phone number from which you will
        access CIS. [A tip here: If you regularly access CIS long distance as
        I do, it is considerably cheaper to cross state lines rather than
        dialing a number within the State. As an example, I live in
        north-central Oklahoma. My normal CIS access number is located in
        Oklahoma City in area code 405. I can, also, dial Tulsa in area code
        918. But by dialing Wichita, KS, to the north in area 316, I get a
        cheaper long distance rate. If this is your situation you might want
        to check it out with your local phone company.] The next character is
        a "=" which is a timed pause to give CIS time to answer you once the
        receiver has been "picked up." If you have trouble here, you might
        try using two "="'s such as "<==". This will double the length of your
        pause. In the majority of cases, however, one "=" is enough. Next is
        "^C" which stands for "control C." To enter this into your sequence
        type capital "6" and capital "C". This is the character used to
        signify a "break" and triggers the following query from CIS.


            CIS will ask your M100/102 what your User ID is. The "?U" tells
            EM8SIG to wait until it "sees" the "U" in "User ID" and then
            start transmitting the next set of characters which is your ID
            number. The "^M" following your number is typed as capital "6"
            and capital"M" and is the symbol for "control M", or <ENTER>. In
            other words EM8SIG will transmit your ID number and then execute
            an <ENTER> to complete the action.






                                       14


        


            Now CIS asks the M100/102 for your Password. Again the "?P"
        instructs EM8SIG to wait till it "sees" the "P" in "Password" and
        then begin transmitting the next series of characters or your
        individual password, followed by the "^M" (control M or <ENTER>) The
        last two characters, ">:", tell CIS the log-on sequence is closed.


            Now lets take a look at a portion of my ADRS.DO file to see how
        it's done.


                 CIS:13166898765<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:
                 CIS2:19187498801<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:
                 CIS3:19187498850<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:
                 DAL:9531971<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:

                                       PIN.DO


           Set up your PIN or PINS file in the following manner. If the
        person's name and ID are strictly to be used for EMAIL then the
        following format will work:

           George Sherman [72300,3203. NOTE: the "[" is mandatory for EMAIL
           to find the ID.

           However, if the name is to be used for SIG messages you -must- set
        up the name and ID is this manner, use of upper or lower case is
        optional.

                ]STAN WONG [70346,1267

           NOTE: the "]" is mandatory for Forum addresses and can be placed
           anywhere within the line BUT -everything- to the -right- of the
           "]" will be used as the Forum message's "To:" entry. However, it
           will do this -only- if you precede each name with a code word of
           no more than 6 letters such as this:

                TA]TONY ANDERSON [76703,4062
                STS]SCOTT T. SCHAD [73720,1166

                STAN]STAN WONG [70346,1267


            If an entry does not have a "]", then the program considers it an
        Email ONLY listing.

            Two more important points with regard to the address listings
        are, first, the "[ID" should be the LAST entry on each line. And,
        second, no spaces can be between the "[" and the "ID". "[ 70346,1267"
        is -wrong- and will result in a program error.

            I have also set up in my PIN file the following:

                ]ALL
                ]SYSOP

            The reasoning behind all of the above will become apparent when
        we discuss writing messages off-line using EM8SIG.400 on page 22.

            Your PIN.DO file will probably start off small with only one or
        two names in it. But as you use EM8SIG more, and make more "friends"
        through your contacts, you will find the file getting larger almost
        every week.

                                  PROGRAM OPERATION


            Now that all the hard work has been done, the initial setup of
        the program, the rest is easy and fun.

            For the following I'm going to make some assumptions. First, that
        you have elected to make M100SIG your default forum and that you have
        set item six (6) on the "Auto Forum" screen to "NO". Second, you
        should have, by now, followed the instructions in Appendix A and set
        your profile correctly. Most of the problems we encounter with users
        of EM8SIG are because these profiles have -not- been set correctly.

            Turn on your M100/102 and using the arrows position the curser
        over EM8SIG and press <ENTER>. After your opening banner has run, you
        will be at the Option Screen (see page 4).


                                    FIRST LOG-ON


            Begin the auto-log-on sequence by pressing F2. Your screen will
        change to the TELCOM mode and you will see the statement in reverse
        video, "Please wait; finding PHONE #". Beneath that will be your
        default listing, in my case "CIS" followed by the phone number to be
        called. Note that "<>" follows the phone number but that your ID and
        PASS*WORD are NOT shown. On the next line the notice, "Calling CIS:"
        or whatever your listing is, and then each number appears as it is
        dialed by the on-time sub. In the event of a "busy," or "no answer"
        access phone number, EM8SIG will automatically hang-up, wait, and
        then redial until a connection with a modem-tone has been made or a
        user predetermined number of tries (default=20) has been reached. In
        that event, the program will leave the user a message, terminate, and
        return to the Option Screen.

            If you seem to obtain an excessive amount of Error 82 messages,
            and you experience no problems in manually dialing CIS, then try
            slowing the program's dialing rate to 10 pps from its default
            setting of 20 pps. This is accomplished by editing line 17 and
            changing the "POKE63019,20" to "POKE63019,1".

            Assuming everything goes as planned, just sit back and enjoy the
        show. You will see EM8SIG log on to CIS, transmit your ID and
        PASS*WORD (although - again- the PASS*WORD will not be visible), then
        switch to EasyPlex and check for waiting Email. If you have mail
        waiting and you have chosen "LPT:" as your download destination for
        Email, your printer will come to life and begin printing your
        messages. If, on the other hand, you have left the incoming Email
        path set at "README.DO", EM8SIG will open that file in RAM if it
        exists, or set up a new file with that name if it does not, and
        deposit your messages there.
