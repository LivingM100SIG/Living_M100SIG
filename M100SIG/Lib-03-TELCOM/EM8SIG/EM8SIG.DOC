                                  WHAT IS EM8SIG ?


           EM8SIG.100 vers 4.0 is a fully configured and function key driven
        program offering fully automated composing, sending, and receiving of
        both CompuServe EasyPlex mail and Forum (Sig) messages.

           Designed for both the occasional novice user and the experienced
        high tech volume user, it saves time and $$$$$$.

           Permission is hereby granted for the posting of EM8SIG.100 and its
        associated files on private, not-for-profit BBS's; provided however,
        any distribution of this program and/or its associated documents is
        made free of charge to any individuals who desire it and all
        duplications contain -all- the program code and associated
        information files with no deletions or changes.


                                 EM8SIG version 4.0
                                 ------------------

                      Auto-EasyPlex                 Auto-Forum

           EM8SIG.400 is an all new version of EM8SIG. The program is now
        capable of performing all SIG functions without taking a mandatory
        detour through the Email system. This is handy if you have picked up
        your Email and Sig messages in an earlier session and are responding
        only to Sig business. In version 3.0 & 3.1, the program forced you to
        check for Email. A few of the menus have been reworked.

           EM8SIG is now about 650 bytes smaller. The new, svelte EM8SIG
        gives you more room to download message header scans and message
        threads without resorting to ram banks or cassette tape.


                                  HISTORY OF EM8SIG


           The program EM8SIG.100 was originally conceived by the late Marvin
        M. Miller who supported it and constantly upgraded it until his
        untimely death in late 1987. Up until almost the time of his death he
        was considering further improvements in the program to take into
        account the wishes of the many users such as the ability to bypass
        the EasyPlex section and go directly to a desired forum. When in 1988
        it was determined that because of recent changes in CIS, particularly
        as they related to the Forums, EM8SIG would no longer be usable a
        campaign was begun to upgrade EM8 to work with the new format. Stan
        Wong undertook to revise Marvin's original program, first with some
        merges to version 3.0, which became version 3.1, and then a complete
        revamping of the program which became the present version 4.0. In the
        latest version, Stan has incorporated many of the changes Marvin had
        been considering. It is to this latest version that this
        documentation is directed, and is the only one currently being
        supported on this forum.

                             WHAT DOES THE PROGRAM DO ?


           EM8SIG.400 saves $$$ and provides a convenient, one-stroke, fully
        automated, high speed method to:

                  o  Prepare Email and Forum messages off-line,

                  o  Supports multiple addressee Email,

                  o  Unattended operation,  auto-log onto CIS at preset times
                     when phone rates are low, send/receive messages, and
                     then auto-logoff,

                  o  Redial if busy signal is encountered,

                  o  Supports a variety of M100 peripheral devices such as -
                     Chipmunk disk drive - RAM banks - Cassette tape -
                     Printer

                  o  Keeps record of CIS charges.

           EM8SIG.400 is menu driven. "Quick start" function key operation is
        also supported bypassing the menus.

                                    INSTALLATION


            Download to RAM EM8SIG.400 as EM8SIG.D0. Check the DO version and
        delete all excess information at the beginning and end of the
        program. The program begins with the line:

            0 GOTO17'EM8SIG.100ver4.0 Copyright (c) 1988 by Stan Wong
            70346,1267--based on ver3.0 copyrightMMMiller:75665,312:5/09/87

        and ends with the line:

            500 CALL21586

            Return to MENU. Enter BASIC. Press F2. You will see the word
        LOAD". Type EM8SIG and press <ENTER>. You will see the flashing word
        "WAIT" as the program loads into basic. When you see the OK prompt,
        press F3. You will see the word SAVE". Type EM8SIG again and press
        <ENTER>. At the OK prompt, return to MENU and you will see EM8SIG.DO
        and EM8SIG.BA. Place the curser over EM8SIG.BA and press <ENTER>. If
        the program has loaded correctly you should now see the opening
        banner. As soon as it has completed its run you will see the first
        screen which asks if you wish to review your options. For now just
        press F8 and return to MENU. Enter BASIC again and type
        KILL"EM8SIG.DO and press <ENTER>. At the OK prompt return to MENU
        again. Make a copy of EM8SIG to either tape or disk.


        PERSONALIZING/GETTING STARTED ******************************

            Before using EM8SIG.400, the user MUST personalize the program.
        This is done by selecting the Option Menus located at the beginning
        of the program.


            THE ONLY WAY THE USER SHOULD MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM IS
            BY USE OF THESE MENU(s) UNLESS DIRECTED OTHERWISE.


            Read the following instructions which will take you through the
        necessary actions screen by screen. Additional information is
        contained in APPENDIX A.


        NOTE: Because it is impossible for me to give you an EXACT copy of
              your screen in the following pages I will give you the
              information you will see on each screen as best I can. Some of
              the lines are in reverse video or white characters on a black
              background. However, the information is the same.


             On the main M100/102 MENU, place the curser over EM8SIG and
        press <ENTER>. After the Opening Banner has run you will see Screen
        Number 1. Turn to the next page.

            This is the Option Screen and is the first screen you see after
        the opening banner has run. From the moment the opening banner
        begins, and throughout the program, unless otherwise specified, the
        Function Keys are live and may be pressed to carry out their various
        activities. If they are pressed while the opening banner is still
        running, the activity will occur as soon as the banner finishes.
        Therefore, at this time we will discuss these keys and what they do.


            <F1> "Quick starts" the program anytime from the start of the
                 opening banner until the "on time sub" starts dialing. (See
                 page 17.) It OVERRIDES any Forum Option Menu Item 6 setting
                 (see page 8) and causes the program to log off from CIS
                 after sending/receiving -only- EMAIL messages.


            <F2> "Quick starts" the program anytime from the start of the
                 opening banner until the "on time sub" starts dialing. It
                 causes the program to perform FULL EMAIL AND FORUM FUNCTIONS
                 including the downloading of New Message Headers.


            <F3> "Quick starts" the program the same as <F2> and performs the
                 same functions with the exception it -does not- download the
                 Forum Message Headers.


            <F4> Enters the "Forum Selection" Menu. This provides a rapid
                 method to select different Forums/Sigs for access by <F2>,
                 <F3>, <F5>, and <F6>. Go to page 12.


            <F5> "Quick starts" the program and performs the same SIG
                 functions as <F2> without taking a mandatory detour through
                 the EMAIL system. This is handy if you have picked up your
                 EMAIL and SIG messages in an earlier session and are
                 responding only to SIG business.


            <F6> "Quick starts" the program and performs the same SIG
                 functions as <F3>, again, without the mandatory detour
                 through EMAIL.

        NOTE: A Forum Option Menu Item 6 setting of "YES" overrides <F3>,
              <F5>, and <F6>. (See page 8.)


            <F7> Calls up the EMAIL/Forum Message Compose Routine. Go to page
                 22.


            <F8> "Aborts" the program to the main MENU anytime after the
                 start of the opening banner until the first Time appears on
                 the LCD after a CIS Logon. THIS IS THE CORRECT WAY TO EXIT
                 THE PROGRAM.


        NOTE: At some points in the program <F8> seems to have no effect.
              When this happens simply press <F8> and then <ENTER>.


            <SHIFT><BREAK> stops program execution at anytime and enters
        BASIC. Typing "GOTO 500" enters the M100/102's Telecom program.
        [We suggest then typing a <CTRL><C> to trigger the Interrupt Menu
        before proceeding further if you are still logged on to CIS.]


        NOTE: "Quick Starts" means the skipping of the Option, Access #, and
              Auto-Time menus and going directly to the program's auto
              dial/logon routine.


            Two other options are available from this opening menu.


            "N" takes you directly to the Access # screen. Goto page 27.


            "Y" takes you through the Option Menus which is where the
        personalization of the program is done. There are three(3) Option
        sub-menus. They are the: 1) EasyPlex Email Menu, 2) Forum/Sig Menu,
        and 3) the General Menu.


            DO NOT TRY TO RUN THE PROGRAM WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THIS STEP
            FIRST. Goto page 6.

            If you wish to change any of the above, use the normal EDIT
        procedures. That is use the <DEL/BKSP> to delete the words between
        the first set of quotes and then type in your choice. As an example,
        suppose you wished to change the incoming EMAIL from README.DO to
        INMAIL.DO. Delete the README.DO between the quotes and type in
        INMAIL.DO. Remember names for DO files cannot exceed 6 characters in
        length.


            Another choice is to change README.DO to LPT: so it will look
        like this "LPT:". Use this as the incoming-message file name for
        hard-copying your incoming mail. NOTE: "LPT:" is the -complete- file
        name --- -not- just a prefix! [CAS:README.DO also works well.]


            EM8SIG, vers4.0, fully supports the use of Holmes/PSCG Chipmunk
        Disk Drive (CDD), the Tandy Disk/Video Interface (DVI), the PSCG
        64/96K Expansion Ram ver2.5 and later (RAM+), the Cassette Tape unit
        (CAS), or a printer (LPT).


            The Tandy Disk Drive (TDD) and the PG design Expansion Ram (PGD)
        can be used only as mass storage devices.

            In the case of the TDD, the Model 100/102 hardware does not allow
        simultaneous use of the modem and the RS232 port.


            In the case of the PGD units, their software/firmware does not
        currently allow active data exchange beween RAM banks.


            File prefixes are required ONLY when using M100/102 accessories.
        Any prefix which is normally recognized by these various accessories
        is permissable. NOTE: The cassette can be used for only one preset
        function per session, either play or record.


            If a wrong file prefix is used, the program will automatically
        abort with an error message plus a signoff if CIS has already been
        accessed.


        CAUTION: Be -very sure- your printer is turned on and ready -if- you
        select to name a file "LPT:"

        characters in length.


            Another choice is to change NEWSIG.DO and/or HDRSIG.DO to LPT: so
        it will look like this "LPT:". Use this as the incoming-message or
        incoming-header file name for hard-copying your incoming messages or
        the headers received from the Quick Scan. NOTE: "LPT:" is the
        -complete- file name --- -not- just a prefix! [CAS:NEWSIG.DO and/or

            We must take special note here of the optional setting for item
        six(6) on the "Auto-Forum" screen which is line 143 on your EDIT
        screen. (See above) A setting of "NO" allows all the preset functions
        of <F3>, <F5> and <F6> to operate as described on page nnn. However,
        if this setting is "NO", and the Autp-Time and/or Auto-Logon
        procedure is used, then the program only accesses EMAIL for uploads
        and/or downloads of MAIL and then logs off. A setting of "YES" will
        OVERRIDE all the preset functions of <F3>, <F5> and <F6> and
        activating them will produce the same results as if you had pressed
        <F2>. So, what is it's purpose? I'm glad you asked. Change the
        setting to "NO" if you always use the "Quick Start" procedure. Leave
        the setting at "YES" if you always use the Auto-Time and/or the
        Auto-Logon procedure. If you occasionally use the Auto-Time and/or
        Auto/Logon procedure, leave the setting at "NO" but don't forget to
        change it to "YES" if you use the automatics.

            Pressing <ENTER> keeps the current choice as indicated at the
        bottom of the screen and takes you to the "Auto-Forum" screen to
        verify your choice. Goto page 8.


            Pressing any number 1 through 7 changes your current choice and
        also takes you to the "Auto-Forum" screen to verify your choice.
        NOTE: EM8SIG permits access to only ONE forum per log-on. Goto page

            If you wish to change any of the above, use the normal EDIT
        procedures. That is use the <DEL/BKSP> to delete the words between
        the set of quotes and then type in your choice. As an example,
        suppose you wished to change IBMNEW to OUTDOORS. Delete the name
        IBMNEW between the quotes and type in OUTDOORS. You may list any
        forum you regularly visit. Try to use the exact name for the forum if
        you know it. I would suggest you leave M100SIG as your first choice.
        However, whatever forum you visit most should be in selection number
        1 position as this is the default selection. That means that every
        time EM8SIG is run, this is the choice which appears in items 1 and 6
        of the Auto-Forum Screen, (page 8) and is the forum EM8SIG will go
        to automatically each time you "Quick Start" or Auto-Time and/or
        Auto-Logon unless you change it using either <F4> from any place
        within the program, or by pressing number 1 at the Auto-Forum Screen.

            Following your changes, press <F8>, then <F4>. Return to page

                                   MANDATORY FILES


            EM8SIG.400 automatically sets up and maintains most of the files
        necessary for its operation with minimal assistance from the user.
        HOWEVER, there are two files which must be established manually by
        the user before operation. The default names for these files are
        ADRS.DO and PIN.DO. (See the GENERAL menu screen on page 10.) As
        with any other file name used by EM8SIG, you can change the names of
        these files to anything which suits your particular fancy by using
        the GENERAL menu screen, or you may leave the names the way they are.
        For instance, I chose to change the name of the PIN file to PINS
        which made more sense to me. For the sake of these instructions, I
        will stick with the default names.


                                       ADRS.DO


            ADRS.DO contains the "Logon Format(s)" which are essential for
        EM8SIG to make contact with CIS and properly log you onto the system.
        As we will explain in an upcoming screen, EM8SIG looks for the
        default designation "CIS" for this information unless you tell it do
        something different. Also, if there are several "CIS"'s in the file
        it will automatically choose the first one. For that reason I have
        named my first Logon sequence "CIS" and each subsequent sequence with
        "CIS" plus a number. Also, I am frequently in Dallas, TX, or Wichita,
        KS, so I include numbers for those two cities prefaced DAL and WIC.

            The following format should be followed when setting up a Logon
        Sequence for EM8SIG.400.

                 CIS:NNNNNNN<=^C?Unnnnn,nnnn^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:

        where NNNNNNN is the phone number through which you plan to access
        CIS, nnnnn,nnnn is your own Personal ID, and PASS*WORD is the secret
        password you have chosen for yourself.


                                      PASSWORDS


            Because what I have to say here is so very important, I want to
        digress for a moment and discuss the PASSWORD. It is imperative that
        you protect the secrecy of your PASSWORD. Do not give it out to
        anyone. Make a habit of changing it on a regular basis. Change it
        sooner if you even suspect anyone else knows it. If you are ever
        on-line and you are suddenly asked for your PASSWORD, immediately
        log-off. CIS never, repeat NEVER, asks you for your PASSWORD except
        during routine log-on.









                                       13


        


            To change your PASSWORD, log-on to CIS manually and type GO
        PASSWORD. You will be asked to type your old password. You must type
        it exactly the way it is. If you are correct you will be asked for
        your new PASSWORD. And then to be sure there are no errors, you will
        be asked to type it again. If the change is successful you will be
        told so by CIS. Don't forget to change it in your log-on sequence in
        your ADRS.DO file as well.

            When you enter a PASSWORD at CIS it is encoded by their mainframe
        and not even the CIS employees have access to it. When you are
        logging-on using EM8SIG your PASSWORD will not appear on the screen
        as it is transmitted. However, of necessity, it IS in your ADRS.DO
        file. Anyone with a minor knowledge of computers could see it by
        accessing that file. If you only use EM8SIG in the privacy of your
        own home, you will probably never have any problem with this.
        However, if you regularly use EM8SIG.400 from an office, or while on
        the road, you might want to consider storing ADRS.DO on disk or tape
        rather than leaving it in RAM. Another point to consider is that
        there are some excellent encryption programs in library 4 of the
        M100SIG.


                                   LOG ON SEQUENCE

            Now back to the Log-On Sequence again. Let's take it apart and
        see what it does.

            CIS is the identifier, or CIS2, or DAL, which ever you choose.
        The next series of numbers is the phone number from which you will
        access CIS. [A tip here: If you regularly access CIS long distance as
        I do, it is considerably cheaper to cross state lines rather than
        dialing a number within the State. As an example, I live in
        north-central Oklahoma. My normal CIS access number is located in
        Oklahoma City in area code 405. I can, also, dial Tulsa in area code
        918. But by dialing Wichita, KS, to the north in area 316, I get a
        cheaper long distance rate. If this is your situation you might want
        to check it out with your local phone company.] The next character is
        a "=" which is a timed pause to give CIS time to answer you once the
        receiver has been "picked up." If you have trouble here, you might
        try using two "="'s such as "<==". This will double the length of your
        pause. In the majority of cases, however, one "=" is enough. Next is
        "^C" which stands for "control C." To enter this into your sequence
        type capital "6" and capital "C". This is the character used to
        signify a "break" and triggers the following query from CIS.


            CIS will ask your M100/102 what your User ID is. The "?U" tells
            EM8SIG to wait until it "sees" the "U" in "User ID" and then
            start transmitting the next set of characters which is your ID
            number. The "^M" following your number is typed as capital "6"
            and capital"M" and is the symbol for "control M", or <ENTER>. In
            other words EM8SIG will transmit your ID number and then execute
            an <ENTER> to complete the action.






                                       14


        


            Now CIS asks the M100/102 for your Password. Again the "?P"
        instructs EM8SIG to wait till it "sees" the "P" in "Password" and
        then begin transmitting the next series of characters or your
        individual password, followed by the "^M" (control M or <ENTER>) The
        last two characters, ">:", tell CIS the log-on sequence is closed.


            Now lets take a look at a portion of my ADRS.DO file to see how
        it's done.


                 CIS:13166898765<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:
                 CIS2:19187498801<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:
                 CIS3:19187498850<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:
                 DAL:9531971<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:
                 WIC:6898765<=^C?U72300,3203^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:











































                                       15


        


                                       PIN.DO


           Set up your PIN or PINS file in the following manner. If the
        person's name and ID are strictly to be used for EMAIL then the
        following format will work:

           George Sherman [72300,3203. NOTE: the "[" is mandatory for EMAIL
           to find the ID.

           However, if the name is to be used for SIG messages you -must- set
        up the name and ID is this manner, use of upper or lower case is
        optional.

           NOTE: the "]" is mandatory for Forum addresses and can be placed
           anywhere within the line BUT -everything- to the -right- of the
           "]" will be used as the Forum message's "To:" entry. However, it
           will do this -only- if you precede each name with a code word of
           no more than 6 letters such as this:

                TA]TONY ANDERSON [76703,4062
                STS]SCOTT T. SCHAD [73720,1166

                STAN]STAN WONG [70346,1267


            If an entry does not have a "]", then the program considers it an
        Email ONLY listing.

            Two more important points with regard to the address listings
        are, first, the "[ID" should be the LAST entry on each line. And,
        second, no spaces can be between the "[" and the "ID". "[ 70346,1267"
        is -wrong- and will result in a program error.

            I have also set up in my PIN file the following:

                ]ALL
                ]SYSOP

            The reasoning behind all of the above will become apparent when
        we discuss writing messages off-line using EM8SIG.400 on page 22.

            Your PIN.DO file will probably start off small with only one or
        two names in it. But as you use EM8SIG more, and make more "friends"
        through your contacts, you will find the file getting larger almost
        every week.




                                       16


        


                                  PROGRAM OPERATION


            Now that all the hard work has been done, the initial setup of
        the program, the rest is easy and fun.

            For the following I'm going to make some assumptions. First, that
        you have elected to make M100SIG your default forum and that you have
        set item six (6) on the "Auto Forum" screen to "NO". Second, you
        should have, by now, followed the instructions in Appendix A and set
        your profile correctly. Most of the problems we encounter with users
        of EM8SIG are because these profiles have -not- been set correctly.

            Turn on your M100/102 and using the arrows position the curser
        over EM8SIG and press <ENTER>. After your opening banner has run, you
        will be at the Option Screen (see page 4).


                                    FIRST LOG-ON


            Begin the auto-log-on sequence by pressing F2. Your screen will
        change to the TELCOM mode and you will see the statement in reverse
        video, "Please wait; finding PHONE #". Beneath that will be your
        default listing, in my case "CIS" followed by the phone number to be
        called. Note that "<>" follows the phone number but that your ID and
        PASS*WORD are NOT shown. On the next line the notice, "Calling CIS:"
        or whatever your listing is, and then each number appears as it is
        dialed by the on-time sub. In the event of a "busy," or "no answer"
        access phone number, EM8SIG will automatically hang-up, wait, and
        then redial until a connection with a modem-tone has been made or a
        user predetermined number of tries (default=20) has been reached. In
        that event, the program will leave the user a message, terminate, and
        return to the Option Screen.

            If you seem to obtain an excessive amount of Error 82 messages,
            and you experience no problems in manually dialing CIS, then try
            slowing the program's dialing rate to 10 pps from its default
            setting of 20 pps. This is accomplished by editing line 17 and
            changing the "POKE63019,20" to "POKE63019,1".

            Assuming everything goes as planned, just sit back and enjoy the
        show. You will see EM8SIG log on to CIS, transmit your ID and
        PASS*WORD (although - again- the PASS*WORD will not be visible), then
        switch to EasyPlex and check for waiting Email. If you have mail
        waiting and you have chosen "LPT:" as your download destination for
        Email, your printer will come to life and begin printing your
        messages. If, on the other hand, you have left the incoming Email
        path set at "README.DO", EM8SIG will open that file in RAM if it
        exists, or set up a new file with that name if it does not, and
        deposit your messages there.








                                       17


        


            NOTE: IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN "LPT:" AS YOUR DOWNLOAD PATH BE "SURE"
            YOUR PRINTER IS **CONNECTED** AND TURNED **ON** OR ELSE YOU COULD
            LOSE -=EVERYTHING=- !!!!! EM8SIG does not check to see if you
            have done this. It just assumes you know what you are doing.

            After checking with EasyPlex, EM8SIG transmits a "GO M100SIG"
        command. As soon as CIS makes the connection, you will see the
        program automatically set up its required Forum options. No permanent
        changes are made to user selected options. The program will then
        "Quick Scan" all message headers of messages uploaded to the forum
        since you last checked in. It will download these to either your
        printer, "LPT:", or "HDRSIG.DO", whichever you have chosen as the
        download path. If you have chosen "HDRSIG.DO" and the file does not
        exist in RAM, EM8SIG will establish it. Next EM8SIG checks for all
        messages addressed to you. It does this by looking for your ID in the
        "To:" field of each message on the forum. That is why including the
        "ID" is so important. If it is not there you may never see the
        message unless you happen to choose to read it because of its title.
        If any messages are found, they will be downloaded to either your
        printer, "LPT:", or "NEWSIG.DO", and as before, if you have chosen
        "NEWSIG.DO" and the file is not in RAM, EM8SIG will establish it.
        Lastly, EM8SIG will reset the high message counter so it will know
        where to begin the next time, and log-off of CIS. In other words it
        will hang-up the phone.

            All of the above will happen very quickly, a lot faster than you
        could have done it manually. And now you can spend your time off-line
        reviewing your messages and checking for other messages that might be
        of interest to you.


                                      CMDSIG.DO

            CMDSIG.DO is another file you must set up manually. It will
        contain your REAd commands when you log back on as well as other
        forum commands you might choose to use.



            The format for reading individual messages is "REA NUM:n" without
        the quotes of course and where "n" is the number of the message you
        want to read.

            The format for reading a thread is "REA THR NUM:n". A "thread" is
        a number of messages on the same subject. Sometimes it is a dialogue
        between two people. Other times others will jump in with ideas and/or
        comments. For this latter reason, a thread can take off in many
        directions but the one common denominator is that all the messages
        have the same title.

            Let's assume after reviewing your printout or file of message
        headers you decide you would like to read message number 180194.
        Enter TEXT by placing the curser over TEXT on the main menu. When
        asked for the file name, type CMDSIG and press enter. Now type REA
        NUM:180194 and press enter. The next time you run EM8SIG, it will
        look for CMDSIG.DO right after it enters the forum and execute the
        REAd command. It will copy message 180194 to your printer or
        NEWSIG.DO file just as it did when there were messages addressed to
        you. If you had wanted to read "thread" number 146192, you would have
        given the command, REA THR NUM:146192. In this case, all messages in
        the thread beginning with that message number and continuing to the
        end of the thread would be downloaded to your printer or NEWSIG.DO.

            I have found that it is possible to put forum commands in CMDSIG
        and they will work as if you had manually typed them in, somewhat
        similar to a macro. The two commands I have experimented with are
        "ANN;1" which give you the announcements at the beginning of the
        forum at log on, and "DES;2;1" which gives you the uploads to the
        libraries for the past 7 days. It is possible to use both of these
        commands at the same time by using the following format thanks to
        Tony Anderson: ANN;1; ; ;DES;2;1; ; ; NOTE: each command is followed
        by the sequence ";<space>;<space>;". Using this arrangement it is
        possible to intermix these commands into REA's (or read individual
        messages), and REA THR's (or read threads).

            When using REA's, it is possible to connect several REA's
        together such as "REA NUM:134890;REA NUM:134987;REA NUM:134990;REA
        NUM:135025". REA THR's should be formatted "REA THR NUM:146921;REA
        THR NUM:149361". It is possible to intermix REA NUM's and REA THR
        NUM's such as "REA NUM:134904;REA NUM:134987;REA THR NUM:146921;REA
        NUM:234990;REA NUM:135025;REA THR NUM:149361". It is now possible to
        also intermix the ANN;1 and DES;2;1 commands, or any other forum
        command you wish to use, as long as you end each of the forum
        commands with the ; ; ;. Such as "ANN;1; ; ;REA NUM:134904;REA
        NUM:134987;REA THR NUM:146921;REA NUM:234990;REA NUM:135025;REA THR
        NUM:149361;DES;2;1; ; ;

            I have been able to chain up to eight REA commands successfully
        this way. Beyond that I get a beep and everything else is ignored.
        This has nothing to do with program, but is a CIS line length
        limitation.


                                    SECOND LOG-ON


            After you have selected the messages or threads you wish to
        review, again start up EM8SIG. Now, you have already looked at the
        Mail, and you have already downloaded the message headers. All you
        want to do now is read the messages you have placed in COMMAND.DOC.
        So this time press F6. You will once again see the program log-on as
        before only this time there will not be a detour through EasyPlex but
        a direct jump to M100SIG or the forum of choice. EM8SIG will search
        out the message(s) as directed, download them and then log-off.





                                       19


        


             Before going any further, check CMDSIG.DO again. You will notice
        that all your commands are now gone and in their place is the word
        "Sent ". This is important because if EM8SIG checks CMDSIG.DO and
        sees that word, it will ignore anything following it and treat the
        file as if it does not exist. Therefore, the next time you put
        commands into CMDSIG.DO you -must- delete the word "Sent ".

                              MESSAGE COMPOSE ROUTINES


            EM8SIG.400 permits the automatic sending of both Email and Forum
        messages that have been composed off-line as well as files previously
        uploaded to the user's CIS PER file area. The user does not have to
        pay attention to line lengths or message lengths. The line length is
        taken care of automatically and the message length will trigger a
        warning message as you approach the size limitations. The messages
        can be composed manually in a TEXT file if the user desires. However
        we -strongly- recommend the use of the MESSAGE COMPOSE subroutine
        (F7) as this will insure correct message formats. Each message is
        separated in the file by a <GRPH f> (hold down GRPH while pressing f
        and follow it with a <CR>). The <GRPH f> must be on a line by itself
        at the left of the page. The file must be ended with an end of file
        (EOF) symbol or left facing arrow. If you use the F7 key and the
        MESSAGE COMPOSE routine you will not have to worry about this. It
        will all be done automatically.

        NOTE: NO <CR>'s should be used inside the messages' text. <CR>'s
        should be used ONLY to end and separate paragraphs.

            Messages are ended by successive <CR>'s. What happens next
        depends on whether you are in the Email or Forum compose routine.


                            EMAIL MESSAGE COMPOSE ROUTINE


            Now, let's assume that when you made the swing through EasyPlex a
        while ago, there was a letter there for you. After reading it
        off-line, you decide to answer it. Start up EM8SIG again and when you
        reach the first screen press F7. You will see the following screen.

                      ________________________________________

            Since you are going to send an Email message press "E". You will
        then see the question, "Add to existing messages?", appear in the
        above screen. Press "N" for "NO" and the screen will clear showing
        only a "To:" in the upper left hand corner of the screen. The name
        and ID of the person you are writing to should already be in your PIN
        file. You may identify this person by first or last name, or by ID or
        any portion thereof. Then press <ENTER>. The program will look up the
        name and ID and enter it into the message file MAIL.DO. If the file
        does not already exist, EM8SIG will create it.






                                       21


        


            NOTE: The search for the name and ID is -case specific-. That
            means you must enter the name exactly the way it is in your PIN
            file for EM8SIG.400 to find it. GEORGE is not the same as George
            or george. If you do not do this you will get an error 81
            message. If you do, simply press F8 and start the procedure all
            over again.


            When the program finds your choice, you will next see "Sb:" on
        the screen beneath the "To:". Enter whatever you wish for a title for
        your message. Notice the "]". This is the guide that tells you how
        long your title can be. Anything beyond that point will be ignored.
        Press <ENTER> again and type your message. Remember not to use <CR>'s
        within the message except to end or separate paragraphs. When you
        finish, press <ENTER> three (3) times and the compose routine will
        terminate. You will again find yourself at the "COMPOSE MESSAGES"
        screen, page 21.

            To send a second letter in the same transmission go through the
        above routine again only this time answer the question, "Add to
        existing messages?", with "Y" for "YES".

            When you have finished with letter writing, either press "P" to
        exit the routine, or "F" to enter the Forum Message Routine.


                            FORUM MESSAGE COMPOSE ROUTINE

            When you review the downloaded messages, either to you, or those
        you were interested in, we will assume you wish to respond or put in
        your two-cents-worth in an ongoing discussion. Also, you have a
        question for the Forum members in general.

            From the COMPOSE MESSAGE screen, press "F". The screen will clear
        and you will see the question, "REply # or COMPose?"

        REPLIES: - - -

            To reply to a specific message enter "REn" where "n" is the
        number of the message you to which you are replying. (without the
        quotes of course.) The screen will clear again and you will see your
        entry in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Now type your
        reply. Your message will be entered into the file OUTSIG.DO. If the
        file does not exist, EM8SIG.400 will create it. Remember, no <CR>'s
        within the message except to end or separate paragraphs. When your
        message is finished press <ENTER> two (2) times. You will now see the
        word "POST". If you are replying to a message, simply press <CR>
        again. The screen will clear and you will be returned to the COMPOSE
        MESSAGE screen, page 21. If you later check the file OUTSIG.DO you
        will notice that EM8SIG has entered a /EXIT and the word POST at the
        end of your message.








                                       22


        


        COMPOSE: - - -

            To compose your own message enter "COMP", again without the
        quotes. The screen will clear and you will see the word "To:" in the
        upper left corner of your screen followed by 23 spaces and a square
        bracket "]". The name and ID of the person you are writing to should
        already be in your PIN file. To cause EM8SIG to search for, and
        properly list the adressee's name AND ID, you must enter the code
        word of no more than six letters which you assigned to the person's
        name and ID in the ADRS.DO file. Then press <ENTER>. The program will
        look up the name and ID and enter it into the message file OUTSIG.DO.
        If the file does not already exist, EM8SIG will create it.

            REMEMBER: TO HAVE EM8SIG PROPERLY INSERT THE NAME -=AND=- THE ID
            YOU -=MUST=- USE THE CODE WORD. IF YOU ONLY ENTER THE PERSON'S
            NAME, THEN ALL EM8SIG.400 WILL PRINT IS WHAT YOU HAVE ENTERED. IF
            THE -=ID=- IS NOT PRESENT THE ADRESSEE WILL NOT RECIEVE THE
            "MESSAGE WAITING" NOTICE AND WILL NOT SEE THE MESSAGE.

            After you have entered the code word and pressed <ENTER> the
        screen will show you "Sb:" followed by 23 spaces and the "]". This is
        the guide that tells you how long your title can be. Anything beyond
        that point will be ignored. Press <ENTER> again.

            If you have set up the following lines in the PIN file:

                  ]ALL
                  ]SYSOP

        and you wish to send a message to either "ALL" or to one of the
        "SYSOP"'s, simply enter that as your name prompt in the "To:" field.

            Now type in your message. Compuserve forums have a maximum
        message length of approximately 2,200 characters. This works out to
        roughly 30 lines or 350 words. As you approach this limit EM8SIG.400
        will beep and give you a warning, "CIS MSG LIMIT. NNN SPACES LEFT"
        where NNN is the total number of spaces you have left to stay within
        the limitation. You should immediately end your message at this
        point. If you have more to say, write "MORE" and end the message.
        Then write a second message beginning with the word "CONTINUED". To
        end your message use three (3) <CR>'s. EM8SIG will prompt you with
        <POST SEC:n Options>? If you do not wish to use any options, simply
        input the number of the section that most closely approximates the
        general idea of your message like this, type "SEC:n".

            Any "Post Action" is acceptable by EM8SIG. However, since we are
        talking about automated message sending, the two "Action"'s we are
        most concerned with are PRIvate and UNFormatted. If you wish to send
        a private message in section 1, you would input, "SEC:1 PRI",
        without the quotes of course. If you wished to send a message to
        section 4 unformatted you would input, "SEC:4 UNF", again without
        the quotes. Please note that private message are NOT enabled on the
        M100SIG forum.

            To obtain the current Section/Subtopic names and numbers for
        whatever forum you are in use the "OPT" command at the first "Forum!"
        prompt after entering the forum. This will need to be done in the
        manual mode, not in the EM8SIG mode. [When in doubt, use either
        section 1 or section 0 to send a Forum message.]

                            LAST CHECK BEFORE TRANMISSION

            I like to do one last check before requesting EM8SIG.400 to
        transmit my newly written messages. If you are confident with your
        typing ability and/or spelling you can omit this step.



            If you are through writing messages, get out of EM8SIG by
        pressing F8. Remember, sometimes you will have to use F8 and <ENTER>.
        You will see one or two files on your main menu depending on what you
        have done in the way of writing messages. MAIL.DO is the file for
        outgoing EMAIL messages, and OUTSIG.DO is the file for outgoing forum
        messages. Enter the file by placing the curser over it and pressing
        <ENTER>. You are now in the standard M100/102 Text Editor. You will
        note that EM8SIG.400 has neatly separated your messages if there is
        more than one with a <graph><f> symbol. It has also ended them with
        the required /EXIT. Each message contains a line which states who the
        message is directed to, the name of the message, and post
        instructions. This was all done automatically based on information
        you gave EM8SIG. You can now correct any spelling, punctuation, etc.
        to satisfy yourself. Be careful not to edit or change any of the
        automatic settings.

                                    FINAL LOG-ON

            We are now ready to transmit our messages which have been written
        off line. Enter EM8SIG.400 as before. You should probably run through
        the "Option Menus" at least as far as the "Auto Forum (Sig) Option
        Menu" to be sure that EM8SIG is being directed to the right forum. If
        you have only Email messages to transmit, press F1. If you have both
        Email and Forum messages, press F3. If you only have Forum messages,
        press F6. Once again, sit back and enjoy the show as EM8SIG.400 logs-
        on, goes to the proper location(s), transmits your messages, and then
        logs-off. As with CMDSIG.DO, EM8SIG will replace your messages in
        each file with "Sent ". You must manually delete this word if you
        susquently wish to sent more messages.


                                      CISUSE.DO


            The CISUSE.DO file can be used as a log of -all- CIS accesses and
        can serve as an index to incoming messages SAVED in the PER file
        area. (See item 5, EasyPlex Email Option Menu, page 6.)

            As well as being used to verify CIS billings, this file can be
        the basis of your client billings. It shows separately Email and

                                   ERROR TRAPPING
                                   ***** ********


            Consistent with the Model 100/102 basic premise, the program has
        been made as user friendly as possible. Extensive new error trapping
        and reporting has been added since earlier versions. As well as using
        all the Model 100/102 error codes, and those of connected devices,
        the following new error messages have been included:

                 ERROR #          MESSAGE

        which the error was experienced. This information will appear in the

            There are two more screens used by EM8SIG.400. We will close our
        discussion with them.

            If, at the Option Screen, page 4, you had answered "N"
        instead of "Y", you would immediately jump to the manual log-on
        screens. The first of these is the Access Number Screen.

            If you are using the log-on sequence which is titled CIS, just
        press <ENTER>. If, however, you wish to use one of the other log-on
        sequences in your ADRS.DO file, you simply enter in the correct
        title. Suppose you wished to dial through another access number you
        have titled CIS2. Then on this screen, simply type in "CIS2" without
        the quotes and press <ENTER>. In either case you will then go to the
        Auto-Time Screen.

        NOTE: If you use the "Quick Start" or Function Key method of acessing
              CIS, EM8SIG will -always- use the first CIS in your PIN.DO
              file. Therefore, the acess number used the most should be your
              first entry in that file.

            In the upper right hand corner of the Auto-Time Screen you will
        see the current time running. If you wish to immediately log on,
        simply press <ENTER>. If you have option 6 on the "Auto-Forum (Sig)
        Option Menu" screen, page 8, set to "NO" EM8SIG will log-on, access
        ONLY the EMAIL section and then log-off. If you wish to manually
        log-on and access a forum as well as EMAIL, you must change option 6
        to "YES".

                             AUTO LOG-ON AT PRESET TIME

            To me, this is one of the neatest features of EM8SIG.400,
        particularly if you have to call long-distance to get onto CIS as I
        do. Look at the screen presentation on the previous page again. Now,
        let's assume you wish to have EM8SIG log on for you at 11:00 p.m.
        Remember that the M100/102 uses a 24 hour clock. Type in "23:00:00"
        without the quotes. You must type a seconds entry even if it is "00".
        Don't forget to separate the hours, minutes and seconds with a colon
        ":". The time must be in six digits. 9:00 a.m. would be typed,
        "09:00:00". After entering your time, press <ENTER>. The middle line
        of your screen now changes to:

                           Auto-Email set for:   23:00:00

            EM8SIG.400 will wait until the time sequence and your entry match
        and then will run through the auto-log-on procedure just as if you
        had been there at 11:00 p.m. and pressed <ENTER>.

            Long distance rates are cheaper at night. Also, not many people,
        except maybe Stan Wong or Mike Nugent are up communing with CIS at
        01:00 or 02:00 a.m. Therefore the system runs faster and on-line time
        is shortened.

            There is one Caveat I must mention though. If, during the timed
        log-on, for any reason the CIS network locks-up, which does happen
        occasionally, EM8SIG does not know it should log-off. Eventually,
        the CIS network will disconnect you. But that could be some time in
        the nature of 20 to 30 minutes. In the meantime EM8SIG.400 just sits
        and waits for something else to happen. (We could program just so
        much intelligence into this thing you know.) I know of no way around
        this problem. However, I have used EM8SIG in this manner many times
        and only experienced the lock-up twice. But I did want you to know it
        could happen.

            The above are my terminal settings and I know that this set up
        works. You don't need to set all items identical to mine.  The
        starred items are critical items.  Set them to the values listed
        above.  Here are some notes on those items:

            (1) Forum mode MUST be set to COMMAND but you can do it in each
                forum instead of here.  Setting this parameter here sets it
                for every forum you visit.  You only need to set it for the
                forums that you visit with EM8SIG.  If there is a forum that
                you visit infrequently but do it interactively then can still
                navigate with menus by setting this parameter to MENU and
                each EM8SIG forum to COMMAND.

            (2) Screen width may be set to 40 for the Model 100/102. However,
                a width of 80 will work for PCs and M100s if you use both. If
                you elect to use the "LPT:" download path and direct
                everything to your printer, you will most definitely want the
                width to be 80.

            (3) This is not strictly required by EM8SIG but have pity on your
                fellow users!  Messages in all CAPS are hard to read and it
                looks like you are SHOUTING!

                              SUGGESTED PROGRAM USAGES
                              ********* ******* ******

        1.  The program can be used as an "Email only" by using the <F1> key.

        2.  Full function auto-Email & auto-Forum operation can be obtained
            by:

            a. the <F2> key, or
            b. setting Item 6, Auto-Forum Screen to "Yes".
               If "b." then the Auto-time routine will always access the Forum
               as well as Email.

        3.  Use the <F3> key to send/receive only Email and Forum messages.
            If there are no outgoing or incoming messages, a message "check"
            can be accomplished in one-minute billing time if CIS is at full
            speed.

        4.  Use the auto-time feature to send and receive messages at
            off-peak hours when the CIS network is at its maximum speed. You
            can cut your message co$t$ by as much as one-half by selecting
            your timing.

        5.  Use Item  5, EasyPlexEMAIL Screen, to SAVE incoming messages to
            your CIS Peronal File Area for later reading.

        6.  Use the multiple addressee feature (To:Ben;Dave;70001,101;EJ<CR>
            to send copies of your messages to your friends, office, etc.
            $ave money as this feature  does not incur the ten-cent per copy
            surcharge as dcoes regular Easyplex and other auto-email
            programs. Addresses approximately three+ messages/minute.

        7.  Use the send-from-PER-area feature (To#FILE.NME:Ben;Ed;Young<CR>
            to send forms, program copies, etc. that have been uploaded by
            Xmodem to multiple/single addressees.

        8.  As posted EM8SIG.400 limits the number of addressees for 6 & 7 to
            25. We suggest that longer lists be subdivided. This limit is set
            in line 17 and can be changed by the user.

        9.  The program automatically sets the M100/102 dialing rate to 20
            pulses per second (pps). If your phone system has trouble
            accepting 20 pps. then change POKE63019,20 in line 17 to
            POKE63019,1 for 10 pps.

        10. The program automatically sets the M100/102's communication
            status to "M7I1E". This is done in lines 17 and 19.

        NOTE: ITEMS 6, 7 AND 8 HAVE BEEN COPIED VERBATIM FROM MARVIN'S
              ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION. NEITHER STAN NOR I HAVE EVER TRIED TO
              SEND MULTIPLE MESSAGES USING EM8SIG. WE DO NOT KNOW IF IT CAN
              BE DONE. IF YOU TRY THIS - AND IT WORKS - PLEASE LET US KNOW.
              MULTIPLE MESSAGES, IF WORKABLE, ONLY APPPLY TO EMAIL NOT FORUM
              MESSAGES. THANKS.



                                  SOME USEFUL HINTS
                                  **** ****** *****


        1. If a Chipmunk is turned off while the CDOS (Chipmunk DOS) is still
           residing in RAM, a NR error in line 17 will occur. Either turning
           on the Chipmunk or removing the CDOS will clear the error.

        2. Error 55, Line 52 plus ?NM ERROR IN 80 will occur if the program's
           files are configured for PSCG's RAM+ expansion RAM and its ROM+
           chip is not turned on. A similar error will occur if the program
           is configured for a Holmes' Chipmunk or a Tandy DVI and it is not
           turned on.

        3. Try writing outgoing messages in different files/banks for sending
           at different times/days. Always REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE "Sent "
           FROM THE FIRST LINE OF BOTH OUTGOING MESSAGE FILES AND THE
           COMMAND(SIG) FILE. Hint: leave the "Sent  " in the file(s) to
           accumulate outgoing messages until the night-time lower phone
           rates and higher system speeds -while- still being able to check
           frequently for incoming messages.

        4. If dialing from PBX/OFFICES/HOTELS always use the direct connect
           modem cable whenever possible. A paper clib or small screwdriver
           makes an excellent tool to release a phone plug that has had the
           plastic tip broken off.

        5. One of our users has made the following suggestion which you might
           want to try. If CIS locks up while you are on line, enter ^C to
           break out of the lock-up. Next type, "GOTO 50" rather than "GOTO
           500" as was previously stated on page 5. This results in a restart
           of the program without a disconnect according to our user. We have
           not tested this so we cannot guarantee its success.

        6. The delimiter on multiple addressee messages is a ";"; such as:
              To:Ben;Dave M;Utt;Max

        7. To send a message from your CIS PER area use this message format:
              To:#FILE.NME:Marv;Jim;PSCG;76576,2033
              The "FILE.NME" is the "to be sent" file's name as it is
              designated in your PER area.

        8. If several persons in your PIN file are given the same "Code
           Word", and that "Code Word" is used in the "To:" line it will send
           messages to multiple addressees.

        9. The auto-dialer will attempt to make contact with CIS. If no
           carrier is detected, EM8SIG.400 will disconnect, wait a few
           seconds, and try again. After 20 tries with no success, EM8SIG
           will indicate a code 82 error in line 55, post this information in
           EM8ERR.DO, and return to the Option Screen, page 4. The amount of
           tries may be adjusted by editing line 55. Change "IFZ>20" to to
           whatever number you choose. As an example, "IFZ>5".


                         HOW TO AUTO-LOG-ON WHEN USING CUPS
                         *** ** **** *** ** **** ***** ****

        To use the auto-log-on with cups:

        1. Place an entry in your auto log-on file (ADRS.DO) that has a 5 in
           place of the phone number; i.e.,

               CUPS:5<=^C?Unnnnn,nnnn^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:

        2. Set the DIR/ACP switch to ACP.

        3. Enter the program and press <CR> twice, wait until the program
           pauses at the Access Number prompt.

        4. Type in: CUP<CR> (-IF- you have used the recommended log-on
           entry.)

        5. The program will then proceed and pause at the Auto-Time prompt.

        6. Place the cups on the phone and dial the access number manually.

        7. While the number is ringing, press <CR>. The program will now
           log-on when the call is answered by a modem. (Don't worry if CIS
           answers before you can press the <CR>. Press it anyway, as long as
           there is a modem tone the program will log-on. If CIS doesn't
           answer before the program times out, then start over and wait to
           press the <CR> after CIS answers.

        8. If dialing from a PBX, office, or hotel, always use the direct
           modem cable whenever possible. Where a direct connection is
           possible, BUT the local phone system will not accept the
           M100/102's pulse dialing THEN dial the access number using the
           local phone and follow the procedures above for using "cups"
           except leave the DIR/ACP switch in the DIR position.
