           EM8SIG.DOC which is the documentation for EM8SIG.400.
        
           EM8SIG.400 an ASCII version of the program.
        
           README which is this file.
        
        
           EM8SIG.DOC is set up for printing and will result in a 37 page
        booklet with instructions for setting up and running EM8SIG.400 on a
        Model 100/102. On your PC type PRINT [path]\EM8SIG.DOC.
        
           Download EM8SIG.400 to your Model 100/102 using LapDos by
        Travelling Software, or some other PC-LAPTOP interface. Then follow
        the instructions on page 3 for installing the program.
        
           I hope you enjoy the program as much as I have.
