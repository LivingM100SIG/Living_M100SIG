Sometimes the applications  for  a  new
device  are  so obvious that you hardly
have to point them out.   For  example,
set  a  Model-100  in front of a pilot,
and it won't take long for him (or her)
to  realize  that  this little portable
powerhouse  could  be  very  handy  for
pre-flight    and   in-flight   chores.
Although there have been other machines
that   one  could  tote  along  in  the
cockpit, the 100 is the first one  with
a  screen  large enough to be useful in
flight.   Not  only   can   the   pilot
retrieve   flight   plans  and  textual
weather  information  obtained   before
takeoff from an information service (or
entered  manually),  but  the  100   is
capable  of  pretty decent graphics - a
capability that can be used to  display
weather radar maps.

     Graphical   weather    maps    are
available from a number of sources, but
one of  the  least  expensive  ways  to
obtain  maps  that are easily displayed
on the Model 100  is  to  download  the
Vidtex (tm) Radar Maps from CompuServe.
To do this, one must have a  CompuServe
Information  Service  account,  and  at
least 16K of  memory.   The  downloaded
maps  can  consume  up to 4K.  The maps
are   transmitted   in   "run    length
encoding",  which  reduces transmission
time as well as minimizing  the  amount
of   RAM   required   to   store  them.
However, without a  program  to  decode
the  run length encoding, the maps make
about as much sense as the listing of a
.CO file.

     Two different graphic  resolutions
are  used:  "high resolution", which is
256  pixels  wide  by  192  high,   and
"medium   resolution"   (128   x   96).
Listing 1 is a program that  will  plot
either  high  or medium resolution "run
length encoded"  graphics  on  the  LCD
screen.   Since the Model 100 screen is
only 240 x 64 pixels, high res maps are
displayed in three sections, and medium
res in two.

     Although  anyone   interested   in
weather  should find these maps useful,
they  are  of  particular  interest  to
aircraft  pilots, especially since maps
can be displayed at any time (including
in  flight).   They  provide  a  useful
reminder  of  general  weather  trends,
although  they  are  not  practical for
detailed  storm  avoidance  like   true
airborne  radar,  since  the data is at
least  a  half  hour   old,   and   the
resolution  is  too coarse.  Each pixel
represents an area 20 x 20 miles.

     The run-length encoding spans  all
characters  from  30  (decimal) through
511, so eight  bit  reception  must  be
enabled  on  your  Model  100.  This is
done by setting the  Telcom  status  to
M8N1E.   However,  CompuServe  normally
sends 7 bit data with even  parity,  so
you  will  see  some strange garbage if
you log  in  with  this  setting.   The
solution  is  to  log  on  with default
status (M7I1E) and change your terminal
parameters  on  CompuServe  to  set the
parity bit to  zero.   This  is  easily
accomplished by logging on, then typing
"GO CIS-9" at the "!" prompt or running
DEFALT   from  the  programmers'  area.
From the DEFALT menu, select 5 (View or
Change  Current  Terminal  Parameters).
Next, select 8 (Parity) and set  it  to
zero.  Finally, exit the DEFALT program
and request that changes  be  effective
for future sessions.  Before logging in
the next  time,  change  your  terminal
parameters  to  M8N1E  in  Telcom.  Now
when you log on you will see  a  little
bit  of  strange stuff until you get to
the Password:  prompt.  This is because
until  you  identify yourself, the host
computer does not  know  what  terminal
parameters you desire.  So, the initial
"User ID:" prompt  is  sent  with  even
parity,  and  those characters with the
parity bit set to one (s,I  and  space)
will  appear  as graphics characters on
the 100.

     At  this  point  eveything  should
appear  normal,  and  you can go to the
Aviation Weather section,  or  directly
to  the  weather  maps  (GO AWX4).  The
program will correctly inform you  that
Telcom   is  not  equipped  to  display
graphics,  and  they  may   appear   as
meaningless  characters,  but  you  can
ignore this.  When you see:

CompuServe Vidtex Radar Maps
choose 1 - Prepare a map  for  display.
Next,  select  2 - Prepare current U.S.
radar reports.  The  system  will  list
the three letter id of each radar site,
and the GMT time of  the  report  being
collected.    After   all  reports  are
collected, choose 2 - Display  prepared
map.   You  may select any of the maps,
but before you press ENTER  after  your
choice,  you must first press F2 (Down)
and specify the name you  wish  to  use
for   the   downloaded  file  (MAP1  or
whatever).  THEN, press ENTER, and  you
will be treated to several screen fulls
of  utter  garbage,  but  don't  panic!
Just  wait  until you hear a BEEP, then
press  F2  (Down)  to   terminate   the
download,  and  ENTER  to tell the host
computer to procede.  You can  now  log
off   or  continue  with  your  on-line
session.

     Once off-line, disconnect  and  go
back  to  the  menu.  From here you can
run the GRAPHR.BA program.  Give it the
file  name you specified to Telcom, and
watch the current weather  map  appear!
An outline of the state boundaries will
be   drawn    with    radar    "echoes"
superimposed   on   top.    "Weak"  and
"moderate"   echos   will   appear   as
horizonal   shading,   while   stronger
echoes appear solid  black.   When  the
screen  is  full,  press any key to see
the next section.

     A design "feature"  of  the  Model
100  will very occasionally cause a map
to  be  partially  trashed.   For  some
reason,  the Model 100 will not store a
delete character (&H7F) in a  RAM  file

without  some  sleight of hand, and one
does not get an opportunity to do  much
magic  in  TELCOM.   The problem can be
avoided by writing  a  special  purpose
communications  program  which replaces
the  delete  character  with  something
else.

     One   final   remark   for   those
contemplating  the  use of this program
in aircraft:  pilots need not be overly
concerned  about  operating a Model 100
in  flight.    Although   the   Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR's) saddle the
pilot    in    command     with     the
responsibility  of  determining whether
or not an electronic  device  (such  as
the   Model  100)  will  cause  harmful
interference with  your  navigation  or
communications  radios,  I  have  found
nothing to suggest a problem.  My Model
100 has many hours of instrument flight
time in my Cherokee Challenger,  and  I
have  never noticed any ill effects.  I
hear the same thing from  other  pilots
who  regularly fly 172's, King Airs and
such with their little white boxes.

     For your convenience, this program
may  be  downloaded  from the Model 100
SIG XA1 Data Base on  CompuServe.   The
file name is:

          GRAPHR.100[70000,130]
