    While being logged on, record the whole session to cassette, and reread it 
later or download the files from the playback!  It is particularly useful if 
you don't own a disk drive and there isn't enough memory to download a couple 
of large files at one log-on.  This only works if you are using the built in 
modem.

  Here's how:
1) Put a microphone at the earpiece of the telephone, start recording, and log 
on.
2) After logging off, stop the recorder, plug in the cassette connector to the 

phone port, instead of cass port.
3) Switch to acoustic coupler setting
4) Go to TELCOM and press F4(terminal mode), or run the short basic program at
 the end of this file.
5)  Rewind to the beginning of the transmission, which is the carrier,
 and play it.  If you have CCR-82 data recorder, set volume to 3 mark.
  Experiment if you have an ordinary recorder.
6) To capture files to ram, you must time yourself, since the incoming data 
cannot wait for the File name? input.  You must know when data is coming and 
ready the capture buffer before it 
comes.



Run this program as an alternative to TELCOM.  Its advantage is that it is 
immune to Lost Carrier, so you can fast forward or rewind.
