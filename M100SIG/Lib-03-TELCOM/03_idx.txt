  With 1200 and 2400 baud modems, the Basic Xmodem programs in DL3 are not
  up to the job, defeating all the speed promised by those modems. Recent
  work by Wilson Van Alst (PCHXMD) has led to enhancements of XMD100.HEX,
  a relocating Basic loader and an accompanying Hayes-compatible
  dialer program: XMDPW2.100/ASM & XMDHAZ.100, respectively.  The advantages?
  -- the following edited messages show why M/L is important for these modems.

  This is an ASCII BASICA or GWBASIC "filter" program that may be required
  to correct problems with ASCII text files transferred from the M100.
  TELCOM apparently doesn't send LFs (only CRs) and some of the earlier DOS
  versions don't pass the CRs (of the CR/LF pairs) sent by the TEXT SAVE
  TO:COM...  This program in the PC adds back in whichever ONE of the CR/LF
  pair may be missing. Input is from a FILESPEC - output is to FILESPEC.PRN.
