       I put the following toggether for my 77 year old mother to use with her Tandy 102.  If she can do it with these instructions, anyone can.
 
                TRANSFERING FILES BETWEEN THE T-100/102/200 *

   RS-232C cable (connect the computers through the null modem)

*  For the T-200 substitute 97E1ENI for 97E1E.
 
  To transfer files to/from other
computers, simply match the communications parameters to:
    19200 BAUD (use 37E1E for 300 BAUD)
    7-bit word
    Even parity
