        six(6) on the "Auto-Forum" screen which is line 143 on your EDIT
        screen. (See above) A setting of "NO" allows all the preset functions
        of <F3>, <F5> and <F6> to operate as described on page nnn. However,
        if this setting is "NO", and the Autp-Time and/or Auto-Logon
        procedure is used, then the program only accesses EMAIL for uploads
        and/or downloads of MAIL and then logs off. A setting of "YES" will
        OVERRIDE all the preset functions of <F3>, <F5> and <F6> and
        activating them will produce the same results as if you had pressed
        <F2>. So, what is it's purpose? I'm glad you asked. Change the
        setting to "NO" if you always use the "Quick Start" procedure. Leave
        the setting at "YES" if you always use the Auto-Time and/or the
        Auto-Logon procedure. If you occasionally use the Auto-Time and/or
        Auto/Logon procedure, leave the setting at "NO" but don't forget to
        change it to "YES" if you use the automatics.

            If you wish to change any of the above, use the normal EDIT
        procedures. That is use the <DEL/BKSP> to delete the words between
        the set of quotes and then type in your choice. As an example,
        suppose you wished to change the Year to 1990. Delete the 1988
        between the quotes and type in 1990. Remember names for DO files
        cannot exceed 6 characters in length.


            You will need to remove Stan Wong's name and insert your own in
        line 100. (Maximum of 15 characters) Then change line 101 to your
        correct time zone. If the area in which you live converts to Daylight
        Savings Time, you will need to change this twice a year when the time
        zone changes from Standard to Daylight time or reverts back to
        Standard. (EXAMPLE: PST to PDT or vice-versa) Next change 1988 to the
        current year. Again, this will have to be changed on or about each
        January 1.


            The remaining three changes are optional.

            If you wish to change any of the above, use the normal EDIT
        procedures. That is use the <DEL/BKSP> to delete the words between
        the set of quotes and then type in your choice. As an example,
        suppose you wished to change IBMNEW to OUTDOORS. Delete the name
        IBMNEW between the quotes and type in OUTDOORS. You may list any
        forum you regularly visit. Try to use the exact name for the forum if
        you know it. I would suggest you leave M100SIG as your first choice.
        However, whatever forum you visit most should be in selection number
        1 position as this is the default selection. That means that every
        time EM8SIG is run, this is the choice which appears in items 1 and 6
        of the Auto-Forum Screen, (page 8) and is the forum EM8SIG will go
        to automatically each time you "Quick Start" or Auto-Time and/or
        Auto-Logon unless you change it using either <F4> from any place
        within the program, or by pressing number 1 at the Auto-Forum Screen.

            Following your changes, press <F8>, then <F4>. Return to page

                                   MANDATORY FILES


            EM8SIG.400 automatically sets up and maintains most of the files
        necessary for its operation with minimal assistance from the user.
        HOWEVER, there are two files which must be established manually by
        the user before operation. The default names for these files are
        ADRS.DO and PIN.DO. (See the GENERAL menu screen on page 10.) As
        with any other file name used by EM8SIG, you can change the names of
        these files to anything which suits your particular fancy by using
        the GENERAL menu screen, or you may leave the names the way they are.
        For instance, I chose to change the name of the PIN file to PINS
        which made more sense to me. For the sake of these instructions, I
        will stick with the default names.


                                       ADRS.DO


            ADRS.DO contains the "Logon Format(s)" which are essential for
        EM8SIG to make contact with CIS and properly log you onto the system.
        As we will explain in an upcoming screen, EM8SIG looks for the
        default designation "CIS" for this information unless you tell it do
        something different. Also, if there are several "CIS"'s in the file
        it will automatically choose the first one. For that reason I have
        named my first Logon sequence "CIS" and each subsequent sequence with
        "CIS" plus a number. Also, I am frequently in Dallas, TX, or Wichita,
        KS, so I include numbers for those two cities prefaced DAL and WIC.

            The following format should be followed when setting up a Logon
        Sequence for EM8SIG.400.

                 CIS:NNNNNNN<=^C?Unnnnn,nnnn^M?PPASS*WORD^M>:

        where NNNNNNN is the phone number through which you plan to access
        CIS, nnnnn,nnnn is your own Personal ID, and PASS*WORD is the secret
        password you have chosen for yourself.


                                      PASSWORDS


            Because what I have to say here is so very important, I want to
        digress for a moment and discuss the PASSWORD. It is imperative that
        you protect the secrecy of your PASSWORD. Do not give it out to
        anyone. Make a habit of changing it on a regular basis. Change it
        sooner if you even suspect anyone else knows it. If you are ever
        on-line and you are suddenly asked for your PASSWORD, immediately
        log-off. CIS never, repeat NEVER, asks you for your PASSWORD except
        during routine log-on.
