
Instruction File for DIRACC.CO
------------------------------

 A Machine-Language program which will allow you to enter BASIC or TEXT mode
 from TELCOM without losing phone line.


1)  Run DIRACC.BA program in BASIC, a LOADER which sets-up DIRACC.CO
    below any other .CO already present in RAM or just below MAXRAM.
    Answering "Y" to the first question in the program will put DIRACC.CO
    just below the currently active HIMEM value.
    Be careful ! The program changes the F6 key in BASIC.
    Also, the program pokes two ram hooks for F6 & F7 in TERM mode


2)  How to use the program when in TERM mode (TELCOM):

  a) BASIC:Press F6 to enter BASIC.
     In BASIC, you can:
        Kill a file from memory
        Save a program to CAS:
        LOAD a prgrm from CAS:
     F6 returns to TELCOM mode.
     Note: DON'T do anything that open or close the COM: or MDM: line .
           e.g.:DON'T go to MENU !

  b) TEXT:Press F7 to enter TEXT. 
     In TEXT, you can:
        Edit an old file 
        Create a new file
     Press F8 to return to TELCOM

  c) DIRECTORY + FREE MEMORY
     Press F7 & ENTER to get a listing
      & Free memory message only.

3)  To remove the routine from memory, you MUST do a "CALL 32454" which
    will remove the ram 'hooks' to F6 and F7 in TELCOM
    or you may face a COLD START.
