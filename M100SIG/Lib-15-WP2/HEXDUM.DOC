   HEX-DUMP is a machine language program that will enable you to look at the
contents of the WP-2's memory, print it out, or send it to another computer
via the RS-232 port.  The data is output in both hex and ASCII format, so both
program code and text will be readable. 
 
   To run the program, download it via XMODEM, either directly to the WP-2 or
to another computer and then to the WP-2 from there.  The WP-2 will let you
download to memory, to the RAM disk, or to a RAM IC card.  The program can be
run from each of these locations, but the copy-file command will not work with
this program if you try to copy it to memory.  Curiously enough, you CAN copy
it to the RAM disk from memory.  I don't have an IC card or disk drive, so I
am unable to test them.  Wherever you decide to put it, bring it up on the
file screen (F2 = from the wordprocessor) and hit RUN (F2-7). 
 
   You will be prompted for start address, end address, dump-to destination,
and slot #.  Start and end address are in hex, and can be anything from 0 to
FFFF.  Destination can be P, D, or R for printer, display, or RS-232 port.
Slot # is also in hex.  It can be anything from 0 to FF (although selectable
slot #s only range from 0 to 1F - more on this later). 
 
   If you change your mind and want to go back to the previous prompt, just
hit <ESC>.  Hitting <ESC> from the start address prompt will exit the program.
You can also hit <ESC> at any time during the dump to abort and return to the
start address prompt. 
 
   If you select the display for dump-to destination, you also have three
other options during the dump.  <P> will pause the output untill another key
is pressed, <F> will make the display page faster (.3 second delay), and <S>
will make the display page slower (1.5 second delay).  The default is <S>low.
After the last line has been displayed, press any key to return to the start
address prompt. 
 
                    SOME NOTES ON SLOT # SELECTION:
    (slot # selection was omitted from the original version of HEX-DUMP) 
 
   The value enterd for slot # is sent directly to output port 51H.  The lower
5 bits of this value select the ROM bank to be bank switched into memory
locations 4000 to 7FFF.  This allows for 32 ROM banks.  ROM banks 15 to 30 (0F
to 1E hex) are assigned to IC ROM card applications.  ROM banks 0 to 14 (00 to
0E hex) contain the wordprocessor, application programs (such as telecom) and
the dictionary. The WP-2 Service Manual gives the false impression that the
BIOS, character font data, and the first part of the worprocessor program are
in bank 0 (I'm referring to the memory map on page 4-18).  In actuallity,
these are located in bank 31 (1F hex), which is permenantly addressed as
memory locations 0000 to 3FFF. 
 
   The top 3 bits select the RAM bank.  I have yet to figure out how this
memory is then accessed.  It is not bank switched into the top 32K of memory
(which would cause the program to crash anyway, since that's where it
resides).  The Service Manual mentions that "Expansion memory is mapped on the
I/O address."  (top of page 4-5).  I assume this means it is port mapped, but
which ports?  Something tells me there are a few entries missing from the I/O
Address Map on page 4-7. 
 
   Anyway, if you don't want to play around with the top 3 bits of port 51H, 
use a value from 0 to 1F for the slot # prompt to select ROM banks 0 to 31.
