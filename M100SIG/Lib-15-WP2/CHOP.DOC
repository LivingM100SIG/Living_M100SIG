What is CHOP?
-------------

CHOP converts WP-2 '.DO' files for use on an IBM-PC.  CHOP runs 
on an IBM-PC or close equivalent.  You must have first trans-
ferred a WP-2 document to your PC (usually via modem or direct 
connection).

WP-2 files have several problems, as they relate to wordprocess-
ing on PCs:

1) WP-2 documents have a 128-byte header.  Since it is in binary 
it can cause your wordprocessor to do strange things,

2) WP-2 documents are stored in 128-byte increments.  An end-of-
file character (1AH) marks the end of data.  IBM PCs, however, 
indicate the end of file via the size stored in the directory,

3) WP-2 documents mark the end of a line with a CR character.  PC 
editors and wordprocessors usually use a CR-LF combination.

CHOP solves problems #1 and #2.  #3 is best solved by another 
utility since it depends on the wordprocessor that you are using.  
CHOP might be extended to treat problem #3 if there is enough 
demand.


Using CHOP
----------

The CHOP syntax is:

    CHOP  <input .DO>  <output-file>

e.g.

    CHOP text.do  output.txt

The file text.do will be "chopped" and written to the file out-
put.txt.  If the file output.txt exists you will be asked if it 
is okay to overwrite it.
