WP2T is the program from the TWPKIT that allows you to convert your
ASCII, WordStar, or WordPerfect files to Tandy WP-2 DO format. WP2T is
an MS-DOS program that runs on any model PC. The resulting DO files,
which reside on your PC, must be transferred to your WP-2 after
conversion.

If you are new to file transfers, there is a brief guide to transfer
procedures in the "Transfers" section, following the "Usage" section.
If you experience difficulties transferring files, locate a colleague
who can help you (try a computer club, a neighbour with a PC, or a
knowledgeable teenager), or ask for help from your computer dealer.

------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

To use WP2T, transfer the executable file, WP2T.EXE, to an MS-DOS
floppy or to a subdirectory on your hard disk.

Before invoking WP2T, it is often a good idea to jot down on a piece
of paper the names of the files you wish to convert to DO files. If
you are using a hard disk, note which subdirectories these files are
in.

At the DOS prompt, type WP2T and press ENTER.

The program will respond with:

     Word Processor to Tandy DO File Conversion Program Vx.x
                 Copyright (c) 1990 G. Wilburn
                   (Default values in CAPS)

     From:  <A>scii  Word<S>tar  Word<P>erfect  (A/s/p) ?

(Note: Entering a CTRL-C or CTRL-BREAK at any point will terminate the
program.)

Press ENTER if you're converting an ASCII file, or type the letter of
your choice and press ENTER. You may use upper or lower case.

If you choose WordStar, the program will respond with:

     Remove Wordstar dot commands (Y/n) ?

If you press ENTER or type Y, WP2T removes them from the DO file. You
may leave them intact if you wish.

For all choices, the program will respond with:

     Strip, leave, or expand control chars (S/l/e) ?

Ordinarily you don't want control characters transferred to your DO
files, so the default is to strip them out. However, because you may
purposely have inserted some control characters you want to transfer,
there is an option to leave them in. The expand option converts a
control character to two visible ASCII characters, a caret followed by
the control character designator -- e.g., caret + S, or ^S.

Expanding control characters can be useful if you're importing a file
you're unsure of and would like to bring in control characters in a
benign form.

After making your control-character choice, WP2T responds with:

     Name of word-processing file to be converted -->

Enter a valid DOS pathname/filename. You may enter up to the DOS
maximum of 64 characters. Filenames and pathnames must not contain any
spaces.

If the program responds with a beep and:

     *** Cannot find file "<filename>" ***

You may have typed the name incorrectly or have entered the wrong
pathname. WP2T will give you an unlimited number of re-tries.

Once you have entered an acceptable filename the system responds with:

     Name of Tandy DO output file -->

Once again you may enter the maximum DOS pathname/filename of 64
characters. The filename itself is limited to 8 characters with the
usual rules of no spaces.

Note: if you simply press ENTER in response to this question, WP2T
will use your source file name and change the extension to .DO
automatically. It will preserve whatever pathname you entered.

If you enter your own name for a DO file, the program will check the
extension to your filename and append .DO if one does not exist. If
you give the file an extension that is not .DO, the program will
change it to .DO for you.

If the output file already exists, you will receive the warning:

     File <filename> already exists. Overwrite (Y/n) ?

Press ENTER or type Y if you wish to overwrite the existing filename
with the new file. Type N if you wish to rename the output file.

Once all the questions have been answered, WP2T starts the conversion
process with the confirmation message:

     Converting <sourcefile> to <targetfile>

A series of dots will appear on your monitor to show the program at
work. Each dot represents a hard return found in the source file.

At the end of the process the program will respond with:

	Conversion complete. Convert another file (y/N) ?

If you press ENTER or type N, WP2T will terminate normally and you
will be returned to the DOS prompt.

If you type Y, you may repeat the conversion process for as many files
as you wish to convert.

Note: If you wish to change source file types, say from Ascii to
WordStar, you must exit WP2T and run it again. It assumes that you are
most likely to be converting files of the same type and retains your
options for the entire session without unnecessary prompting.

If you make a mistake in your conversion choices, simply run WP2T
again. Your original word-processing file is not changed or deleted.
Output DO files are converted copies of the original.

Transfer:

To transfer DO files to your PC, your Tandy WP-2 will ordinarily be
connected to your PC via a null-modem cable.

If you don't already own a null-modem cable, you can obtain all the
parts you need to create one at your local Radio Shack store. In my
case I required 4 cables: two 9-to-25-pin converters -- one for the PC
and one for the WP-2, one 25-pin null-modem adapter, and one 25-pin
female/female gender changer. With luck you may locate a null-modem
cable that connects to both computers and is complete in one cable
without the extra connectors.

Hook all this stuff together and attach one end of the null-modem
cable to your WP-2 9-pin RS-232 port and one end to your PC 9- or 25-
pin RS-232 port (usually called COM1 or COM2). On your WP-2, press F2
and the '-' key and adjust your WP-2 TELCOM setup to RS232C, 9600
Baud, 8 data bits, parity NONE, 1 stop bit, and CRC-XMODEM transfer
protocol.

Again on your WP-2, press F2 and 9 to start the TELCOM program. Set up
a communications program on your PC -- I use Telix -- to the same
settings as your WP-2 TELCOM program. Activate the PC communications
program and test the cables by typing on each computer and seeing if
the keystrokes appear on the display of the other.  If it does, your
null-modem cable(s) are okay and you're ready to transfer.

Type F1 and D to start the WP-2 download procedure. Press ENTER when
MEMORY is highlighted. Enter the name of the DO file you wish to
transfer into your WP-2. Don't forget to add the extension .DO to the
filename.

When the WP-2 responds with "Downloading..", turn to your PC and start
the upload procedure built into your PC software (in Telix, it is PGUP
or ALT-T). Select XMODEM protocol. If there is more than one option
for XMODEM, select XMODEM-CRC. Enter the name of the DO file you wish
to send to the WP-2. Remember to add the extension .DO to the
filename.  Press ENTER and momentarily the file should be on its way.
At 9600 Baud it takes only a few seconds to transfer even large files.

Repeat the process for any additional files you wish to transfer. At
the end of your transfers remember to press F2 and the Del key on the
WP-2 to terminate TELCOM.

DO files may also be transferred from a remote PC or BBS using a
modem. The procedures are similar to a null-modem transfer, but you
need to set your WP-2 setup to MODEM and a lower Baud rate such as
2400 or 1200.
