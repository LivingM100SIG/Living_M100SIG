Background:

I thoroughly enjoy the freedom and convenience of using a lightweight
electronic notebook I can carry in my briefcase and use nearly
anywhere. I recently purchased a Tandy WP-2 for this purpose.

As a part-time freelance writer (I manage computer systems in my day
job), I require good file exchange options between my notebook
computer and my desktop system. I wrote the programs in the TWP
toolkit to make file transfers between the WP-2 and my desktop PC
cleaner and more synergistic than the built-in WP-2 functions permit.

I created these programs because the otherwise nifty Tandy WP-2 does a
poor job of file conversion. Its ASCII files do not contain the
Carriage Return/Linefeed (CRLF) line endings required by DOS. Its
ASCII upload facility inserts superfluous, highly undesirable, CRs at
every 80th character, and there is no built-in facility for preserving
underline or boldface attributes. Furthermore, the WP-2 does not clean
out the DOS LFs from a transferred DOS ASCII file.

The TWP Toolkit has turned my WP-2 into the writing/editing instrument
I have been looking for as a replacement to my well-worn, 1983-
vintage, Tandy Model 100 portable.

I am making the toolkit available to other WP-2 owners in the hope
they might also find it useful. There is no charge or shareware fee
attached to these programs for personal use. If you distribute the
programs to others, please include the DOC files. (Reasonable
corporate site licences are available for the commercial use of these
programs.)

If you find the toolkit useful, please drop me a note or email
message. I'm interested in your feedback in terms of likes, dislikes,
suggestions for improvement, and, of course, any bugs you discover. I
will base any future releases on the feedback I receive.


----------------------------------------------------------------

Considerations and Limitations:

Each program in the toolkit has its own doc file that explains how it
works. The following is a more general description of the underlying
assumptions of the toolkit.


     Conversion philosophy:

If you wish to exchange files between your WP-2 and your desktop word-
processing system, you will find this works well if you do not expect
the WP-2 to be more than it is -- a simple electronic notebook. To
gain maximum synergy out of your two systems all you have to do is
follow one basic rule: KEEP THINGS SIMPLE!

The Tandy WP-2 DO file format is a very basic format that offers a few
text and printer attributes. It does not begin to match a full-scale
desktop word processor in richness or complexity.

The only special text attributes this toolkit attempts to preserve, in
both transfer directions (upload and download), is boldface and
underlining. It also preserves TAB characters and the extended
characters used for foreign-language characters, symbols, and
graphics.

It makes no attempt to preserve page breaks, soft returns, margin
settings, tab settings, or centering. These are matters that have more
to do with printing than with text creation or editing.

There are also built-in physical limits. You cannot, for instance,
transfer a file to the WP-2 that exceeds the amount of memory
available for that file. You can, however, break larger word-
processing documents into small, logical chunks such as chapters or
sections that you can transfer into the WP-2 for editing.

Here are some general observations about exchanging word-processing
files and WP-2 files:


     ASCII

ASCII files, or DOS text files, are the simplest to convert because
they are the most "plain vanilla" -- that is, they don't contain any
native text attributes such as boldface or underline, or word-
processing attributes such as margin information, tab settings, etc.

Furthermore, nearly everything in an ASCII file is visible. There are
only two fundamental considerations to take into account: line endings
and file endings.

DOS native text files end each line with a carriage return (CR) plus a
line feed (LF) character. In contrast, Macintoshes end each text line
with a CR only. Unix text file lines end in LF only. Sharing a CP/M
heritage, DOS text files sometimes end in a CTRL-Z. DOS, however, does
not need this archaism, nor do Unix or Mac.

When converting files from the WP-2 DO format to ASCII, the T2WP
program strips the Tandy 128-byte header, strips the Tandy CTRL-Z from
the end of the file, and changes all line endings to CRLFs.

When converting DOS ASCII files to the WP-2 DO format, the WP2T
program adds the Tandy header, adds a CTRL-Z at the end of the file,
and changes all line endings to CR only.

The T2WP program preserves WP-2 underling and boldface attributes by
exporting them with the following ASCII notation:

     <i>  Begin italic (underlining)
     </i> End italic
     <b>  Begin boldface
     </b> End boldface

This notation is based on the text markup scheme suggested by the
Chicago Guide to Preparing Electronic Manuscripts (University of
Chicago Press, 1987).

There is currently no provision for converting this notation back to
internal WP-2 DO codes.

The simplest way to move files from word processors other than
WordStar or WordPerfect to the WP-2 is to save them as ASCII first and
then convert them to DO files using WP2T. Some word processors, like
WordPerfect [see CTRL-F5], offer you two ASCII options: DOS text and
Generic. Choose generic. It outputs a complete paragraph in each line
of ASCII text, perfectly preserving paragraphs for use in your WP-2.

If your word processor only creates ASCII files with paragraphs broken
into several lines with a hard return on each line (line-by-line
format), you may use another program in this toolkit, LASCII, to first
groom the file into "Long ASCII", or paragraph-per-line format and
then convert the file to DO format using WP2T.

When converting DO files to ASCII, T2WP gives you the option of
exporting the file on a line-by-line or paragraph-per-line basis. The
line-by-line option is best if you are going to use the file in a DOS
or Unix ASCII text editor, while the paragraph option is preferable if
you intend to transfer the file into a word processor.

The line-by-line option allows you to choose a line length between 10
and 127 characters. There is a 10,000-character limit on the length of
a line with paragraph-per-line option. (I can always increase this
limit if I discover any Faulkners out there who write paragraphs
larger than 10K.)


     WordStar

Converting DO files into WordStar 4.0 files with T2WP is a
straightforward process. WP-2 underline pairs are turned into WordStar
^S pairs and WP-2 boldface pairs are turned into WordStar ^B pairs.
Each paragraph in the DO file becomes a paragraph in WordStar. You
must reformat each paragraph once the file is in WordStar.

Extended graphics and foreign-language characters are preserved in
WordStar 4.0 notation. This notation will be honored by WordStar 4.0,
NewWord, and, I think, Galaxy.

TAB characters remain as tabs, even though WordStar does not use them
directly. Inside WordStar they can be expanded into spaces with a
search and replace.

Converting WordStar files to DO format is more complicated. WP2T
unsets WordStar "high" bits and removes WordStar soft carriage
returns, soft hyphens, and soft spaces. WordStar paragraphs are
preserved as WP-2 paragraphs. WordStar 4.0 extended characters are
preserved in the DO file.

One of the useful things about good old-fashioned WordStar is its use
of "dot commands" for complex formatting instructions. To remove this
complexity from a file, all you have to do is strip out the dot
commands -- the default option for WP2T WordStar conversions.

On the other hand, WordStar's use of visible dot commands allows them
to travel well back and forth between WordStar and the WP-2 if you
wish to retain them.

At this time there is support only for "classic" WordStar -- versions
up to and including 4.0. Higher versions of WordStar files must first
be saved as WordStar 4.0 files before they can be converted into DO
files.


     WordPerfect

As with WordStar, converting DO files into WordPerfect 4.2 format is
simple. WP2T turns WP-2 underlining into WordPerfect underlining and
WP-2 boldface into WordPerfect boldface. Language and graphics
characters are converted into WordPerfect internal notation and WP-2
hyphens are converted into WordPerfect hyphens.

WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 will read the converted WordPerfect 4.2 format
files directly with no additional conversion required.

Converting WordPerfect 4.2 files into DO format is, to say the least,
challenging. WordPerfect is an extremely rich and complex word
processor and one should exercise a certain caution in trying to bring
any WordPerfect files into the WP-2. I do it all the time with
WordPerfect 5.1, but I carefully limit my use of WordPerfect
attributes to boldface, underline, and foreign-language characters.

As mentioned, WP2T only converts WordPerfect files that are in
WordPerfect 4.2 format. From version 5.0 and up, WordPerfect has
become an extremely complex file format. WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 files
must first be saved as 4.2-format files through the CTRL-F5
WordPerfect conversion functions. In practice, this presents few
inconveniences.

The only WordPerfect attributes that are converted are underline,
boldface, and line endings. WordPerfect paragraphs are preserved as
WP-2 paragraphs. WordPerfect soft carriage returns are discarded and
WordPerfect Indent characters are converted to tabs. WordPerfect
hyphens are converted to standard ASCII hyphens, and extended
characters are preserved. NOTHING else is converted, so be careful.

If you control your own WordPerfect files, as I do, the conversion
works well. However, if you wish to load someone else's WordPerfect
file and you're not sure what's in it, I suggest you use the
WordPerfect CONVERT program and convert it to WordStar format first
and bring that into the WP-2 instead.

The reason for the conversion to WordStar is that it eliminates a pile
of embedded WordPerfect instructions that might otherwise make editing
the file rather messy. At the same time, it preserves the basic
boldface and underline attributes and any extended characters.


Final note:

Although I have made every attempt to test the programs in the toolkit
against real-life files, there are so many possible variations that it
is quite probable I have overlooked some potential problems or have
simply programmed some features incorrectly. If you experience any
anomalies, please drop me a note describing what happened so I can try
to duplicate the problem and correct it in a future release.

The programs in the toolkit are written in Turbo C 2.0. They are
based, loosely, on some of my previous programs: WSA (WordStar to
Ascii), ASW (Ascii to WordStar), and WS2SGML (WordStar to SGML).

Writing this toolkit has been fun and the programs have boosted my
enjoyment of my WP-2. I hope they do the same for you.
