   HEXEDIT is a programing utility that allows you to view and modify, in
either hex or ASCII, any part of a file.  The file can be located in memory,
on the RAM disk, on a memory card, or on diskette (see note below).  The
program itself can be run from any of those locations as well, and does not
have the problem with copying to memory as is the case with HEXDUMP. 
 
SELECTING A FILE:
 
   To execute HEXEDIT, download it via X-MODEM, pull it up on the Files menu,
and press RUN (F2-7).  HEXEDIT will give you the same menu display as the
Files application does, but the header will be "Edit from:" instead on "Files
for:" and the TAPE option will not be there.  Select a file the same way you
would for Files.  That is, select the device with the left and right arrows,
press <ENTER>, then select a file with the up and down arrows.  Press <ENTER>
again when you have the desired file highlighted. 
 
EDITING A FILE: 
 
   The first 128-byte record of the file will appear on the screen in both hex
and ASCII.  You can go to the next record by pressing right arrow or the
previous record by pressing left arrow (assuming there IS a next or previous
record).  Shift- right arrow will take you to the last record in the file, and
shift-left arrow will return you to the first record. 
 
   At any record you can exit the file by pressing <ESCAPE>, or go into modify
mode by pressing <M>.  Exiting the file will return you to the "Edit from:"
menu, where you can select another file, or press <ESCAPE> again to return to
the Files menu.  Modify mode is explained below. 
 
   At the last record, you have a few more options.  If the file's size is not
an even multiple of 128, the last record will only be a partial record.  That
part of the last record not in the file will show up highlighted.  Non-memory
files generally have lengths that are multiples of 128 unless you change them
to be otherwise.  Memory files are always multiples of 32, due to their
particular file structure. 
 
   To change the file length, bring up the last record and press minus (-) or
plus (+) to subtract or add one byte (subtract or add 32 bytes for memory
files).  The program will automatically switch to the previous record if you
wipe out the entire record. You can also add a record by pressing <A>. 
 
MODIFYING A RECORD: 
 
   Pressing <M> while editing a file will take you to modify mode.  You can
modify in hex or ASCII.  Press F1-A to go to ASCII modify or F1-H to go to hex
modify.  The mode indicator in the upper-righthand corner will show which is
currently selected. 
 
   While in modify mode, the current byte will be highlighted. In order to
change the value of that byte, type in the hex value (in hex mode), or the
ASCII character (in ASCII mode). 
 
   The arrow keys will move the cursor specifying the current byte in the
appropriate direction.  In ASCII mode, all other keys will be interpreted as
ASCII characters (unless F1 or F2 are held down).  In hex mode, you can press
<ENTER> or <ESCAPE> to exit modify mode.  You cannot exit modify from ASCII
mode. 
 
   Exiting with <ENTER> will save your changes, while <ESCAPE> will abort
them; however, your changes can be recovered after pressing <ESCAPE> by going
back into modify mode without changing records, then exiting with <ENTER>. 
 
 
   NOTE: HEXEDIT has not been tested on memory card files or
         diskette files.  Although it SHOULD work with these
         devices, since the file routines are the same as for
         RAM disk files, the author disclaims any responsibility
         for the performance of HEXEDIT with these devices.
         (I suggest you move any important files out of memory
         before trying HEXEDIT with said devices.)
