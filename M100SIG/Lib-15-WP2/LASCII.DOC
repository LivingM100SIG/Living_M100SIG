LASCII converts standard ASCII files, like this one, to
long ASCII files -- that is, files that have one long line
of ASCII text per paragraph.

LASCII distinguishes paragraphs by a blank line between
blocks of text.  It turns each block of text it finds into
one line of ascii text.  I wrote this for prepping files,
such as e-mail or on-line text, for retrieval into a word
processor for additional formatting.  I use it frequently
to prep Newsbyte stories for sprucing up in WordPerfect.

LASCII program allows you to strip control characters from
an ASCII file, to leave them in, or to expand them into
visible characters surrounded by angle brackets -- e.g.
<H> representing Control-H.

LASCII does terrible things to lists unless there is an
extra line between each list item.
