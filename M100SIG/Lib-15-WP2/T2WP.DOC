T2WP is the program from the TWPKIT that allows you to convert Tandy
WP-2 DO files to your choice of Ascii, WordStar, or WordPerfect files.
T2WP is an MS-DOS program that requires your Tandy DO files to be
transferred to your PC before it can perform a conversion.

If you are new to file transfers, there is a brief guide to transfer
procedures in the "Transfers" section, following the "Usage" section.
If you experience difficulties transferring files, locate a colleague
who can help you (try a computer club, a neighbour with a PC, or a
knowledgeable teenager), or ask for help from your computer dealer.

------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

To use T2WP, transfer the executable file, T2WP.EXE, to an MS-DOS
floppy or to a subdirectory on your hard disk.

Before invoking T2WP, it is often a good idea to jot down on a piece
of paper the names of the DO files you wish to convert to word-
processing files. If you are using a hard disk, note which
subdirectories these files are in.

At the DOS prompt, type T2WP and press ENTER.

The program will respond with:

     Tandy DO to Word Processor File Conversion Program Vx.x
                 Copyright (c) 1990 G. Wilburn
                   (Default values in CAPS)

     To:  <A>scii  Word<S>tar  Word<P>erfect  (A/s/p) ?

(Note: Entering a CTRL-C or CTRL-BREAK at any point will terminate the
program.)

Press ENTER if you're converting to an ASCII file, or type the letter
of your choice and press ENTER. You may use upper or lower case.

If you choose ASCII conversion, T2WP will respond with:

     Output by <P>aragraph or <L>ine-by-line  (P/l) ?

Pressing ENTER or typing P will cause the ASCII file to be output as
one paragraph per line, the usual choice if you wish to preserve
paragraphs in a word processor. Typing L will select the line-by-line
option -- i.e., a paragraph will usually be split into several lines
and each line will be terminated by a hard return. This is the best
option if you expect to use the files in a DOS or Unix text editor
such as Qedit or vi.

If you choose <L>ine-by-line, T2WP will then respond with:

     Maximum line length (default = 65) ?

If you press ENTER, the resulting ASCII file will have a maximum of 65
characters per line. The range of valid choices is a minimum of 10 and
a maximum of 127. You may enter any number within this range.

The program will now respond with:

     Strip, leave, or expand control chars (S/l/e) ?

Ordinarily you don't want control characters to be exported to your
word-processing files, so the default is to strip them out. However,
because you may purposely have inserted some control characters you
want to export, there is an option to leave them in. The expand option
converts a control character to two visible ASCII characters, a caret
followed by the control character designator -- e.g., caret + S, or
^S.

After making your control-character choice, T2WP responds with:

     Name of Tandy DO file to be converted -->

Enter a valid DOS pathname/filename. You may enter up to the DOS
maximum of 64 characters. Filenames and pathnames must not contain any
spaces.

Note: the program will automatically check the extension of your
filename and append .DO if it does not exist. If you give the file an
extension that is not .DO, the program will change it to .DO for you.
T2WP will not attempt to convert a file unless it has a .DO extension
in the filename.

If the program responds with a beep and:

     *** Cannot find file "<filename>" ***

You may have typed the name incorrectly or entered the wrong pathname.
T2WP will give you an unlimited number of re-tries.

Once you have entered an acceptable filename the system responds with:

     Name of word-processing output file -->

Once again you may enter the maximum DOS pathname/filename of 64
characters. The filename itself is limited to 8 characters plus a 3-
character extension, with the usual rules of no spaces.

Note: if you simply press ENTER in response to this question, T2WP
will use your source file name and change the extension to .TXT, .WS,
or .WP for ASCII, WordStar, or WordPerfect, respectively, depending on
the type of word-processing file you have selected. It will preserve
whatever pathname you entered. You may wish to use this feature for
convenience or for keeping your file conversions organized.

If the output file already exists, you will receive the warning:

     File <filename> already exists. Overwrite (Y/n) ?

Press ENTER or type Y if you wish to overwrite the existing filename
with the new file. Type N if you wish to rename the output file.

Once all the questions have been answered, T2WP starts the conversion
process with the confirmation message:

     Converting <sourcefile> to <targetfile>

A series of dots will appear on your monitor to show the program at
work. Each dot represents a hard return found in the source file.

At the end of the process the program will respond with:

	Conversion complete. Convert another file (y/N) ?

If you press ENTER or type an N, T2WP will terminate normally and you
will be returned to the DOS prompt.

If you type Y, you may repeat the conversion process for as many files
as you wish to convert.

Note: If you wish to change target file types, say from Ascii to
WordStar, you must exit T2WP and run it again. It assumes that with
multiple conversions you are most likely to be converting to files of
the same type and retains your options for the entire session without
unnecessary prompting.

If you make a mistake in your conversion choices, simply run T2WP
again. Your original DO file is not changed or deleted. Output files
are converted copies of the original.

Transfer:

To transfer DO files to your PC, your Tandy WP-2 will ordinarily be
connected to your PC via a null-modem cable.

If you don't already own a null-modem cable, you can obtain all the
parts you need to create one at your local Radio Shack store. In my
case I required 4 cables: two 9-to-25-pin converters -- one for the PC
and one for the WP-2, one 25-pin null-modem adapter, and one 25-pin
female/female gender changer. With luck you may locate a null-modem
cable that connects to both computers and is complete in one cable
without the extra connectors.

Hook all this stuff together and attach one end of the null-modem
cable to your WP-2 9-pin RS-232 port and one end to your PC 9- or 25-
pin RS-232 port (usually called COM1 or COM2). On your WP-2, press F2
and the '-' key to adjust your WP-2 TELCOM setup to RS232C, 9600 Baud,
8 data bits, parity NONE, 1 stop bit, and CRC-XMODEM transfer
protocol.

Again on your WP-2, press F2 and 9 to start the TELCOM program. Set up
a communications program on your PC -- I use Telix -- to the same
settings as your WP-2 TELCOM program. Activate the PC communications
program and test the cables by typing on each computer and seeing if
the keystrokes appear on the display of the other.  If it does, your
null-modem cable(s) are okay and you're ready to transfer.

Type F1 and U to start the WP-2 upload procedure. Press ENTER when
MEMORY is highlighted. Enter the name of the DO file you wish to
transfer to your PC. Don't forget to add the extension .DO to the
filename -- the WP-2 does not find this automatically.

When the WP-2 responds with "Uploading..", turn to your PC and start
the download procedure built into your PC software (in Telix, it is
PGDN or ALT-R). Select XMODEM protocol (or XMODEM-CRC if there is more
than one choice of XMODEM). Enter the name of the DO file you wish to
capture on disk. Remember to add the extension .DO to the filename. 
Press ENTER and momentarily the file should be on its way. At 9600
Baud it takes only a few seconds to transfer even large files.

Repeat the process for any additional files you wish to transfer. At
the end of your transfers remember to press F2 and the Del key on the
WP-2 to terminate TELCOM.

DO files may also be transferred to a remote PC or BBS using a modem.
The procedures are similar to a null-modem transfer, but you need to
set your WP-2 setup to MODEM and a lower Baud rate such as 2400 or
1200.
