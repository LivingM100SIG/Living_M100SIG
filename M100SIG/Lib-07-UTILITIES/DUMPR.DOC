DUMPR.BA is a program that simplifies dumping of all .DO files resident in a 
Model 100 to another file or device. Function keys are set up to select output:

1. Through the RS232 at one of four baud rates; 2. To cassette; 3. To a 
printer; 4. To a file or device of your choice; e.g., LCD:, RAM:, another COM: 
protocol.
Before dumping, check that the BASIC programs are save in ASCII with the
  SAVE"Filespec",A
command. I use it to dump my .DO files every other day or so -- just in case.
Each file in the DUMP file starts with "{" which is character string (123) and 
not an overly common 7-bit character. It can be generated on the Model 100 
keyboard with GRPH/9.
.
Here's how it works with a CP/M machine:
1. Connect the RS-232s of the two machines with a null modem cable and set the 
CP/M machine to 1200 baud, 7 bits, even  parity and 1 stop bit.
2. Check your Model 100 MENU to make sure all the BASIC files you want to save 
appear there with a .DO extension. If not, go to BASIC, load the file, and save
it with the ,A option.
3. Type:
PIP DUMPDATE=RDR:[E]
on the CP/M machine and press <Return>.
4. Select function key F2 [1200] on the opening screen.
5. The Model 100 will dump all ASCII files and include a header at the 
beginning of each file. The DUMPR program sends a Control-Z when it is finished
and the CP/M machine writes the file to disk.
6. To reload the files into the Model 100, go into TEXT and select F2 Load. 
Answer "Load from" with COM:57E1E and press <ENTER>. On the CP/M machine type
PIP PUN:=DUMPDATE[E]
and press <Return>.
7. After the file is back in the Model 100, go to the beginning of the file.
8. Press F7 (Select) and then F1 (Find) and then GRPH/9. This marks all of the 
first file. Press F6 (Cut) and the file is in the PASTE buffer.
9. Exit to the MENU and open a new TEXT file with the name of the file selected
above.
10. Press PASTE. Delete the header and your file is back to its original state.

11. If the file you selected is a BASIC file, go into BASIC and push PASTE. 
Then SAVE the file under its original name.
12. Go back to the DUMP file until you've moved out all the important files. 
Then you can kill the DUMP file.
.
To dump to other machines use a terminal program if they don't support 
transfers through the operating system.
I've used the program on the Nelma Personna, Hyperion and TRS-80 Model III.
