.   Questions about the 100's DATE$
bug have continued for some time.  Yes,
it IS a bug.  Fixable?  Depends on who
you talk to.  Fixable in present ROM
space... apparently not.  So, here's my
personal cure.  In MOST applications 
programs, there is a command 'MENU' to 
exit the program.  I change it in all 
of them to 'RUN"CLEAR"'.
.
.   My program 'CLEAR.BA' is listed 
below.  Actually, I string it all 
together into one line, but for 
purposes of explanation, it's separated
here.  Line 1 resets DATE$, needed or
not.  Line 2 beeps to tell me when the 
program is finished.  Helpful, not 
necessary.  Line 3 clears file and 
string space (I leave a few bytes of 
string space available for operations 
in the command mode),and THEN returns 
you to the menu.
.
   You could also put line 1 (below), 
into applications which use DATE$.
Very little overhead involved, and 
you can just about forget the problem.
Once a year, increment the "84".
.
   Hope it helps		...ej
