  * Instructions for PROTEC.BA
  *
 PROTEC.BA is intended for use by registered owners of PROAID for preventing 
other machine language programs from conflicting. RELOC.BA (which is supplied 
by Micro Demon with PROAID) does this as well, but I've found some programs 
still give me a nasty cold start.
 
 PROTEC.BA assumes:
 
1) PROAID has been relocated down to accommodate the HIMEM that normally occurs
when the other ML program is running. (For TP100, it is 60416.) This is done 
using RELOC.BA.)
 
2) ONOFF.BA (also supplied with PROAID) is present, with these changes:
 
 a) In Line 1, change the value of HM
    to the aforementioned HIMEM value
    minus 1792. (For TP100, this
    is 58624.)
 b) In Line 300, change the clear
    statement to reset HIMEM. (For
    TP100: CLEAR 256,60416.)
 
 For general tidiness, I use Larry Gensch's INVISI.BA to hide both PROAID.CO 
and the other machine language program. PROTEC.BA gets renamed as a ".BA" 
version of the ML program. (For example, TP100.BA).
 
 So when the cursor is put on, say, TP100.BA <Enter>, you either get TP100 to 
run or a warning that PROAID is active and can be turned off first. If you 
reply "y", you branch to ONOFF.BA.
 
 Suggestions welcome!
