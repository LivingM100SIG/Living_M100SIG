Please Read All the Instructions Before Using FIXF1.

First Down-Load FIXF1 from DL4, thereby producing a text file FIXF1.DO, and
then go into BASIC, type LOAD"FIXF1", and wait for the BASIC version of the
text file to load into BASIC. Then save a copy of the BASIC program to a RAM
file by typing SAVE "FIXF1" (ENTER). Now, before doing anything else, save a
copy of FIXF1.BA to a casette, or disk file for future access. 
   To function, FIXF1 must be loaded immediately after SUPERA in memory, so
if you have any other BASIC programs in your computer you will have to remove
them at this time before FIXF1 will work. If there is enough memory
available, you may be able to just save them temporairily as TEXT files by 
using the ,A option (eg SAVE"JUNK",A which will save a copy of the current
BASIC program to a TEXT file called JUNK.DO) 

   Now With Supera turned ON, run FIXF1 by placing the cursor over the file
FIXF1.ba and presing ENTER. You will see the words "FIXF1 is ON" appear on the
display. That's all you have to do. If you try to list the program, you will
see that nothing is there. 
   Now, to see if everything is working properly, go into a TEXT file, and
define a macro, say key Q, as
   F1,book
Now when your press the ESC Q key, you should see 'STRING:book' appear on the
bottom line of the display. So, now if yfor example you wanted to quickly
locate each occurence of the word 'and', you would only have to assign to a
macro the sequence
  F1 a n d ^M 
Now each time you press the macro key, you will move immediately to the next
occurence of 'and', generally this will happen so fast that you won't even see
the STRING": prompt appear at the bottom of the display.

To Turn FIXF1 off, just RUN the program a second time, and you will be asked if
you want to turn if off. If you do, just reply by pressing the Y key.


   Some Precautions
1. Don't load and list FIXF1, just leave it alone. It's a M/L program, and if
you fool around with it anything could happen.

2.Don't KILL SUPERA or FIXF1 whenever either one is ON.

3.TO make sure that you don't inadvertently KILL FIXF1, you can use
the SUPERA Rename command to name FIXF1 as +FIXF1, now the KILL command won't
wotk, and you will have to rename the program before you can KILL it.

4.Turing CDOS ON OR OFF will turn FIXF1 off, and you will have to restart it.

5.Turning SUPERA off will NOT turn off FIXF1. If you ever want to remove both
FIXF1 and SUPERA, be sure to turn them BOTH off first.

6.If you do let your curiosity get the better of you and you absolutely must
look at the program, then don't be distrubed by the fact that the REM
statement of line 10 changes after you run the program, this is normal, and
also be SURE to type NEW (ENTER) when you are finished.
