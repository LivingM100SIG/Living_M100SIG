PASDOC - (C) 1983 Adv Tech Comm


This program will allow you to assign a
password to your computer and prevent
others from using it when you desire
otherwise.

To execute once uploaded (CISTRN highly
recommended), simply position the cur-
sor on the program title, press enter,
and the computer will automatically
shut itself off.  Once turned back on,
the words "Enter password" will appear
in the center of the screen.  Type the
keywords you have assigned, and the
program goes to MENU; but anyone not
having the correct keyword will not be
able to use the computer.

The initial password contained in the
program is "ANTARES", however you may
change this by altering lines 30 and
40 to read:


30 A$=INPUT$([number of characters in
   your password])

40 IFA$<>"[your password]"THENFORX=1TO
   100:NEXT:PRINT:GOTO20


Additional software for the Model 100
is being developed for use via the SIG-
Access system.  Watch for it!
