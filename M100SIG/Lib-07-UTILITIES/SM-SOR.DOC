Documentation to the sm-sort.100

Basically a shell-metzner sort program
that appears in the model 100 owners
manual modified for better under-
standing and slightly faster than the
original.  it is not fast; but versitle
. this program requires that you have
your fields in a consistant order.
  example:
20 spaces for the name
5    "    for the zipcode
???  "    for the address
and you can sort from spaces 5-10 if
you want to. you can use the 'name'
and change your sorted program to
'note.do' and use the 'schedule' system
program to search for other items...
and later on or if you can figure it
out, you can sort after special
characters no matter where it appears
in the line. 
example: the following line are data.
 
opps, baker street, *78934
who's there,*93843
 
the program could start sorting after
it finds the '*' in the line.  the
modification to that program is simple
and i'll probally upload it soon but
i'll give you a chance to do it.  the
advange of doing that is that it saves
precious memory.  Example:
!8823094   @30994  #0984
!93        @8      #99385
----can be condensed to...
!8823094@30994#0984
!93@8#99385
and you can still sort by any '!','@',
or '#'. neat?  
Lastly, i merged another one of my
programs into this that tells you how
long it took to sort your file.
(lines 1405, 10000-10020)
this can be deleted with line #10020
changed to line #10000.
hope you like it.
