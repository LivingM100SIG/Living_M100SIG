			  Redirect LPT I/O to COM Port

	LPTCOM  is a program which will send data written to the LPT port
	of the M100/102 to the COM port.  LPTCOM is useful for people who
	have serial printers.   Most Basic programs use LPRINT  statments
	to  write  to the print device.   It is inconvenient to find  and
	change all the print statements to use the serial port.   This is
	impossible  if the program is written in machine language  (m/l).

	I wrote LPTCOM because I have two parallel printers at home and a
	serial  printer  at work.   I wrote a simple utility F2COM  which
	prints  a text file on a serial printer but some packages  insist
	on a parallel printer.   The listing for F2COM is included at the
	end of this document.

	LPTCOM  does not performs true I/O redirection as in CP/M or  DOS
	machines.  The routine which sends data to the printer port is in
	ROM  and  can  not  be changed.   If you are  interested  in  the
	programming techniques used please read the file LPTCOM.NOT.

	LPTCOM  requires  that a shorting plug for the  printer  port  be
	built.   This  is  described  in the section  below.   Since  the
	printer routine is in ROM we have to fool the M100 into  thinking
	that a printer is hooked up and ready.   In fact if you hook up a
	serial AND a parallel printer at the same time,  your output will
	be printed on both machines.

	The program F2LPT can be used to test your setup.  The listing is
	included at the end of this document.

	Create  a  LPTCOM.BA  file and run  in  the  usual  fashion.  The
	comments lines 1-6,15,19,39,  and 89 can be deleted while in your
	machine.   The  program is 1317 bytes long with comments and 1023
	bytes without.

	The main LPTCOM menu offers four choices:

				 I)nitialize
				 L)PT-to-COM
				 C)OM LF
				 T)op Menu

				   Initialize
				   ----------

	If  the  MDM or COM ports have been used for  any  other  purpose
	since  Initialize  was last run you must re-initialize the  port.
	The port settings are in line 22.   It is currently set to 88N1E.
	Change  it  to  suit your serial device.   LPTCOM also  uses  the
	memory  reserved for the F7 function key.   You can not  use  any
	program  that defines F7 and LPTCOM.   If a program that you  use
	sets  F7  and  later  you want to print  to  COM,  you  must  run
	Initialize again.



				   LPT-to-COM
				   ----------

	Select  this  option  to enable or disable  the  I/O  redirection
	feature.

				     COM LF
				     ------

	If  your serial printer (or device) requires that a LF  character
	be sent after every CR, enable this option.


				    Top Menu
				    --------

	Return to the M100/102 main menu.



				  Shorting Plug
				  =============

	Connect  a wire jumper between pin 21 (BUSY) and any of the  even
	number  pins 2-24.   Pin number 21 is the third from the left  on
	the  top  row  as you look at the printer  connector.   The  even
	number  pins  2-26 are on the bottom row.   Any  pin  except  the
	leftmost  one  (pin  26)  will do.   There is a  picture  of  the
	connector in your users manual.

	Below  is a list of possible ways to construct the shorting plug.
	It  is  not  meant to be a  comprehensive  list.   The  suggested
	solutions are given in order of "most permanent" solutions.

	** To create a permanent shorting plug buy a 26-pin connector and
	add a jumper wire.   To aid in removing the plug you may want  to
	add  a short length of ribbon cable to the plug and then tie wire
	21 to ground (even pins 2-24).

	**   Use  the  standard printer cable and add  a  jumper  at  the
	Centronics  plug  end of the cable.   The printer cable  for  the

	TTXpress  printer has serial DB25 connector even though it  is  a
	parallel  printer.   It is easier to hook a jumper to serial pins
	that Centronics pins.

	**  Add a jumper to the printer port connector.   I used a  short
	push-on  jumper of the type used for wirewrap posts.   This makes
	for a handy "emergency" jumper if you are on the road and need to
	use a serial printer.  Be careful though,  if you bump the jumper
	wire you can bend the connector posts (I did).

	**  Use a paper clip on the printer connector.   It's awkward but
	it works.  I used this method for initial concept testing.

	F2LPT  is a simple program to help you check out your setup.   It
	prints a text file to the printer via Basic LPRINT statements.

	F2COM  is  a simple Basic program which prints a text file  to  a
