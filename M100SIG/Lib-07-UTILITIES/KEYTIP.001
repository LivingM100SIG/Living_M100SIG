To All Users:

   Here is an alternative to using the "Rubber Bands" as described elsewhere
on the SIG for "Quieting" the keyboard of a Model 100/200.  Purchase from your
local sewing center a package of Felt with the adhesive backing. It's usually
green and for $1.99, more than enough to do the job. Cut out little squares
just large enough to cover the key cap base without interfering with key 
movement.  Next using a paper hole punch, punch out a hole and elongate if
necessary to fit over key stem. Finally, remove backing, stick-em and replace
key caps.
   Neither method cures all noise as some comes from the up-stroke of keys,
for which there is no apparent fix. I've been using the felt for 7 months with
no problems.       Good luck.
