                   RUN-CO.100
-
     RUN-CO is a VERY simple to use 274 byte M100/102/200 utility program that 
AUTOMATICALLY clears HIMEM, and RUNs any RAM or DISK based .CO program without 
any input from you except FILENAME (+ DOS prefix if possible and desired).
-
     SET-UP:
     Download RUN-CO.DOC (this file) and RUN-CO.100 or RUN-CO.200 as 
appropriate; checksum, and SAVE as RUN-CO.BA which can be run from RAM or DISK.
YOU MUST FIRST DECIDE HOW TO MODIFY Line 5 FOR YOUR COMPUTER so PLEASE read the
"Important Information" section below before continuing. It could save you a 
COLD-START!
-
     OPERATION:
     You will see a list of loaded RAM files. At the prompt, type in a .CO file
name from the list or a DISK file name with prefix if your DOS permits. DO NOT 
include the .CO extension. Press <ENTER>. That's all! Your chosen program will 
load and run. When your .CO program is finished it will return to wherever its 
author intended: either to "where called", in this case, since RUN-CO is a 
BASIC program, to BASIC; or to the MAIN MENU.
     After you have chosen Line 5 values as described below, you will find that
selecting RUN-CO and pressing <ENTER> at the filename prompt is a quick way to 
reset HIMEM and return to the main menu. Feel free to rename RUN-CO if you use 
a "MAXRAM" version in one bank and a different value in another. (I run an 
invisible version from a function key in each bank.) 
-
     CREDITS:
     The credit for the heart of RUN-CO goes to Ed Geise who wrote POWR-DOS and
used the idea in DMENU.BA. I thought it was too neat an idea to remain buried 
in that fine but BIG multi-op menu prog. Send comments and (heaven forbid) any 
problems to me.

                       IMPORTANT INFORMATION
-
     RUN-CO makes .CO program use so simple that a few general words here about
overall .CO program management could save some frustration later. I will 
briefly discuss the two "H"'s of .CO programs: "HOOKS" and HIMEM.
-     
     HOOKS: MANY .CO programs set up electronic "hooks" in your computer when 
they are run. These are special internal routines which are *NOT* disabled 
simply by running another .CO program in the same HIMEM space! They usually 
stay behind, waiting to ambush the first poor soul who happens to run some code
past a "hook" and gets caught UNLESS YOU "UN-INSTALL" ANY .CO PROGRAM *EXACTLY*
THE WAY THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES IN THE INSTRUCTIONS!  This seems like a simple 
rule but we all forget it from time to time with very cold results. MOST of the
better M/L programs around make some reference to un-loading procedures if they
operate in HIMEM.
     DOS programs, M/L text formatters, spread sheets; just about ANY 
commercial and MANY SIG programs ALL use hooks of some kind. When in doubt READ
THE INSTRUCTIONS! If there are no specific unloading instructions then chances 
are good (but NOT certain) that returning to the FACTORY main MENU, after 
leaving the program, has returned things to normal.
-
     HIMEM:  RUN-CO first clears MAXRAM (see below for other values) and trys 
to RUNM your chosen program; it fails with Error 7, then reserves the proper 
HIMEM using your program's TOP address and runs your program. 
     RUN-CO does NOT SAVEM .CO programs! It only RUNs them and running a .CO 
program, particulary from DISK, does NOT leave ANY indication behind when you 
leave the program, other than a lowered HIMEM, that your .CO program is STILL 
in HIMEM between its TOP and MAXRAM. When you run another .CO program, it will 
probably load OVER the previous program. Therefore: DON'T re-run a loaded .CO 
program by using a CALL command unless you are ABSOLUTELY certain which program
is loaded! After a while, we can easily forget the correct execution CALL for 
the current program (or even which program is loaded) and the wrong CALL is a 
sure, quick ticket to a COLD-START! Simply re-run RUN-CO (with consideration 
always of the "hook" discussion above) and you should not have any problems.
-
     LINE 5:  Considering the proliferation of M/L programs all competing for 
the same HIMEM and the simplicity of .CO program operation now afforded by RUN-
CO I have written line 5 to CLEAR256,MAXRAM. This will set HIMEM = MAXRAM every
time you use RUN-CO and ensure that programs (or users) who rely on HIMEM = TOP
can depend on that relationship.
-
     >>> NOTE: If you keep .CO programs permanently loaded in HIMEM (like 
DSKMGR.CO) You MUST change "MAXRAM" in line 5 to YOUR "regular" HIMEM value or 
you COULD lose that code. This assumes that any other .CO programs you run with
RUN-CO have been created to live with your HIMEM program(s).
-     (now return to OPERATION: above)
