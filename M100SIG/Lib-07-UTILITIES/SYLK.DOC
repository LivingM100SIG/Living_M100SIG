The program in MPN001 is designed to convert a Mod 100 MultiPlan spread 
sheet into a text (.DO) file for inclusion in a report or printing to a 
serial device.  The SYLK file format is useful for transmitting a spread 
sheet, but wasteful if only the contents are of interest.  In addition, 
M100 MultiPlan cannot print spread sheets on a serial device.  The program 
in MPN001 is a first cut at a generally useful program and I would 
appreciate receiving feedback from MultiPlan users.  I am well aware of 
MultiPlan/LUCID differences, and prefer MultiPlan because it provides 
unlimited integer and rounding functions.  On this point, too, I would like
feedback.
 
A byproduct of this program derivation was my learning how to erase 
MultiPlan cells.  The BLANK command does not erase the cells but fills them
with spaces or blanks.  To erase cells, move previously unused cells from 
some other part of the spread sheet over the cells to be erased.  It takes 
a little effort to decide what size area to move, but it is worth it to 
save memory and SYLK file size.
