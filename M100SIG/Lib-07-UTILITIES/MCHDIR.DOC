The file MCHDIR.100 is a BASIC program that loads a 236 byte machine code 
program (PCD) into the contiguous memory location of your choice.  An 
additional 13 bytes are used by the BASIC calling program (D).  PCD provides 
a paged display of the name of all RAM files and their size in bytes.  The 
names of the BASIC and patch buffers are changed to Basic.BF and Patch.BF.  
Also, the name of the BASIC calling program is shortened from D.BA to just 
D.  This allows running the program from the MENU by just typing D and a 
RETURN.  The Model 100 doesn't have to be in any particular state to load 
the programs (i.e. cold start reset not necessary).

Whether loading MCHDIR.100 from a RAM file, cassette, or whatever, the first 
thing to do is to SAVE it to RAM:D.BA (Note that RAM:D.BA is self-altering 
and hence a poor choice for backup).  Next RUN the program.  First, you will 
be asked if you have saved the program to D.BA.  If you have done so, hit 
ENTER.  Next, you will be asked where to start loading PCD (i.e. HIMEM).  
Usually just hit enter and confirm your choice with a "Y".  Once the program 
returns to the Ok prompt, TEMP.DO and any other file associated with this 
program, except D, may be deleted.

PCD may be loaded below any other machine language programs that reside 
below MAXRAM or other programs may be loaded below PCD as long as an 
additional 20 bytes are left between the start of PCD and the end of the 
program below it.  If you prefer not to see Basic.BF and Patch.BF change the 
number 144 in the DATA statements to 152.
