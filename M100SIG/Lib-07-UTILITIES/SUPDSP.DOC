SUPDSP.100 is a flexible BASIC program that displays (or prints, etc.) the 
current values of Supera's macro function keys. It should work with any version
of Supera. To use:

1) Supera must be in your machine, although it doesn't matter whether Supera is
on or off.

2) Run SUPDSP. If you get an "OV" error, don't panic: see "more magic" below.

3) You'll be prompted for the "output file" (anything BASIC can "OPEN"). The 
default is "LCD:" (your screen); other useful values are "LPT:" (to send the 
output to your printer), and "some-name" (to create RAM file "some-name.DO").

4) You'll be prompted for the kind of output you want. SUPDSP can produce full 
Supera graphics, or "printer" graphics (see "Notes" below). Supera graphics are
the default if the output device is "LCD:"; printer graphics are the default 
for all other devices.

5) If you've asked for printer graphics, you'll also be prompted for the output
device's line width. The default is 39; if you enter a value less than 20, 20 
will be used.


I find it useful to define a macro key as:

RUN"SUPDSP SHIFT-ENTER SHIFT-ENTER SHIFT-ENTER

From BASIC, such a key will cause the current definitions to be displayed on 
the screen, using Supera's graphic conventions.


Notes
-----
Supera graphics: the graphics used are identical to the ones Supera uses when 
you're entering a definition. GRPH-e (the little TEXT triangle) is the only 
exception: in definitions, Supera stores GRPH-e internally as CTRL-M.

Printer graphics: some gimmicks are used to unambiguously represent the M100's 
256 characters using just the printable subset:

  "Regular" ASCII characters (32-126): these are printable - no problem.

  "Control" characters (0-31): represented as "<CTRL-letter>"; e.g., ASCII 1 
yields "<CTRL-A>".

  "Graphics" characters (128-255): represented as "<GRPH-nnn>", where "nnn" is 
the ASCII code; e.g., the airplane (GRPH-a) yields "<GRPH-133>".

The following exceptions make the printer graphics easier to read:

  ASCII     Key       Output
  -----     ---       ------
      8    BKSP       <BKSP>
      9     TAB        <TAB>
     13   ENTER      <ENTER>
     27     ESC        <ESC>
     28  cursor      <RIGHT>
     29  cursor       <LEFT>
     30  cursor         <UP>
     31  cursor       <DOWN>
     32   space      <SPACE>
     60       <       <LESS>
     62       >    <GREATER>
    127     DEL        <DEL>

Magic: the program starts by deviously figuring out where your version of 
Supera stores its key definitions. Don't change this section unless you know 
EXACTLY what you're doing!

More magic: SUPDSP will die with an "OV" error UNLESS you've created KEY.CO at 
least once since Supera itself was last loaded. It doesn't matter whether 
KEY.CO (or any keyset .CO file) exists WHEN you run SUPDSP - it only matters 
that it DID exist ONCE (Supera changes itself the first time it creates KEY.CO,
and SUPDSP depends on that change).


Very special thanks to: Dennis Thomas, for not settling for the first attempt; 
Paul Sumi, for infinite patience, common sense, and good ideas; and, to David 
Sumner of MicroDemon, Inc., for testing this with many versions of Supera, for 
discovering the need for "more magic", and, especially, for writing Supera to 
begin with!.
