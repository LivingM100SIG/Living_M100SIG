SETTER, (c) copyright 1990 by Henry Glover, 72256,2564

This program allows for rapid setting of the computer clock using conventional
AM/PM mode entries.

Caveat:  Year is set for 1990 in the present program.  At the start of each new
year the last 2 digits of the year - which are embedded in the program - must
be updated by entering basic, editing line 1 and replacing the prior year's
digits with those of the new year, after "N=".  The year (as well as the day)
is then automatically set (or corrected) whenever you enter the program.


For the purposes of this program, "AM" is defined as that time period extending
from one second after 12 midnight to high noon, ie, from 00:00:01 to 12:00:00,
and conversely, "PM" is defined as that interval extending from one second
after high noon to midnight, ie, from 12:00:01 to 00:00:00.


On entering the program, the current setting of the computer clock is displayed
in conventional AM/PM mode.  Date, time, or both are set by pressing the
designated function keys - F1, F2, or F3.

All time entries, as mentioned, are in conventional AM/PM mode with no 0
prefixes.


Examples:


To set noon, enter A + <ENTER>
                  12 + <ENTER>
                   0 + <ENTER>
                   0 + <ENTER>
when prompted for AM/PM, hour, minutes, and seconds.

To set 1 second after noon, enter P,12,0,1 at the respective prompts.

To set 1 second after midnight, enter A,12,0,1 at the respective prompts.

To set "15:09:02", enter P,3,9,2 (in conventional AM/PM mode) at the respective
prompts.

To set 7 seconds after 5:06PM, enter P,5,6,7 at the respective prompts.


Reminder:  On entering PM times do not use 24 hour "military" time designations
- this program is set up for conventional AM/PM time entries (ie, enter 8 for
8PM, not 20).


The situation is similar for entering dates:

To enter "01/05/90", simply enter 1, and 5 when prompted for #month and #day;
the day and year are automatically set by the program.

If any errors are made during the course of entering data which cannot be
erased by DEL/BKSP, simply press F1 (RESET) + <ENTER> to correct the error.
To return to the clock display press F2 (CLOCK) + <ENTER>.


The program is readily adapted to the M200 by entering basic and making the
following changes:

       line 1  - change "CALL16959" to "CALL20318"
       line 4 and line 18 -
               - change "PRINT@280" to "PRINT@600"
               - change "PRINT@285" to "PRINT@605"
               - change "PRINT@315" to "PRINT@635"
       line 18 - change "PRINT@290" to "PRINT@610"
