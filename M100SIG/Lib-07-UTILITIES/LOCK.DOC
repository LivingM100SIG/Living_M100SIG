I know, I know, yet another password protection program.

Well, none of the other ones on the SIG did everything I wanted them to.  So,
here's the one I use.  Maybe you'll want to use it too.  It is pretty good, if
I do say so myself.

It's all M/L, so it's fast and uncrackable.  The only way to get past
LOCK is with the password, or >The Big Chill<.

The password doesn't echo to the screen, and LOCK keeps track of how many bad
tries are made to enter the system, and when the correct password is entered,
the number of bad tries and the last password tried are reported.

Changing the password is made easy with LOCK's companion program, LOCKC.

Both LOCK and LOCKC are loaded by LOCK.LDR, a basic loader created with
BASBLD.PW3.  <SAVE ALL IMPORTANT FILES FIRST! - just in case.>  LOCK.LDR may
be erased after the first run, and LOCK.CO and LOCKC.CO should be saved to
disk or tape.  The programs both run in the ALT LCD buffer at $fcc0, so they
can be executed from the main menu without clearing memory first.  LOCKC
is only needed to change the password, and needs not be in memory otherwise.

After running LOCK.LDR, the password is "password".  Original, huh?  LOCK.LDR
runs LOCKC immediately so you can change it to YOUR password, maximum 15
chars.  LOCKC first shows the old password, has you type the new one
<enter or ^C or shift-break aborts the program, leaving the original password
intact.>, then type it again to verify it.  Then you're returned to the menu.

From then on, whenever you want to turn off the computer, run LOCK.CO from the
menu.  This turns off the computer.  When you turn it back on, you get the
"keyword>" prompt.  Type the password, then enter.  If it's wrong, the prompt
goes inverse and you get one more chance before the computer turns off again.
If it's right, you are told if anybody else has been tinkering with the
computer, and then returned to the menu.

If, by chance, you forget your password, the only way back in is to hold down
CTRL-BREAK and press RESET, after which you will be zapped back to the turn of
the century and all files will be lost.

M/L buffs will want to see LOCK.SRC, which contains the Custom Software ASM
source for both LOCK and LOCKC.  Some of the code was borrowed from another
password program that appeared in an old issue of Creative Computing.  If you
have Custom Software's assembler, you can modify the source code of LOCK and
reassemble <if you want a different prompt or something>.  Just make sure
you leave 'pwlen' and 'pw' at the top, or LOCKC won't work.

Enjoy LOCK.100.  Don't turn your M100 off without it!
