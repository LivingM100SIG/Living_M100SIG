This is the text of message I wrote a year or so ago, in response
to a question.  It describes the "non-file" items listed by the
program FILEN.100.  I assume it applies to FILEN.200, too -- but I
cannot test that.

1) "Reserv.ed" is reserved memory from HIMEM to MAXRAM, and
    usually means you have a machine language program in residence
    (intentionally or otherwise).  You can recover this RAM by
    doing 'CLEAR 256,MAXRAM' while in Basic.

2) "File  .BF" is a file buffer, related to having MAXFILES=N,
    where for N=1 the buffer size is 267 (in a Model 100).  You
    can get rid of this by setting MAXFILES=0; but I don't
    recommend doing this, since some programs won't run under
    these conditions.  But if File  .BF is 3-4 times larger than
    267 bytes, go to Basic and do 'MAXFILES=1'.

3) "Noname.BA" is the last unsaved Basic program accessed (i.e.,
    loaded but not saved to the menu).  It can be cleared down to
    two bytes by going to Basic and doing 'NEW'.

4) "Paste .BF" is the paste buffer.  It can become quite large,
    and make it appear that your RAM is dwindling!  You can clear
    it in Basic by doing 'CLEAR', 'CLEAR 256,HIMEM' or 'CLEAR
    256,MAXRAM' (the latter will zap any resident machine language
    programs, though).  The paste buffer can also be cleared by
    entering a text file (in TEXT) and hitting keys F7 and F6 in
    succession.

5) "4 PCS.G" is something you will see if you have Lucid (or
    SuperROM) installed.  It is the Lucid paste buffer, and can
    become quite large.  It can be cleared down to 11 bytes by
    copying a blank cell while in Lucid.  To eliminate it
    completely after removing Lucid, use the file K4PCS.G in DL4.

FILEN, in addition to showing the sizes of all files on your menu
(and hidden files), is an extemely valuable indicator of memory
usage.  It was one of the first utilities I loaded, and I'm never
without it.
