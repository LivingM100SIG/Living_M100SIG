          Pop-Up Version 1

=======================================
Description:  Pop-Up is a utility resident in memory and (when active) can be 
called at almost any time from within almost any program to display a "window" 
of information.  Currently the information includes the time, date, and number 
of bytes free.  When you are finished, the "window" disappears and the program 
that was previously running is returned to normal.  Pop-Up is a machine 
language program and requires only 366 bytes when loaded.

How to Load the Program: First, convert the BASIC program from a document file 
to a BASIC file and run the program.  It will load the machine language program
into addresses 58000-58366.  A checksum is kept to prevent any loading errors. 
After a successful load, the file "POP-UP.CO" will appear on the main menu.  
You are ready to run it.  The BASIC loading program is no longer needed.

To Activate Pop-Up: Just place the cursor over "POP-UP.CO" on the main menu and
press enter.  There will be a short message and a notice indicating that Pop-Up
is now active.  If the computer instead beeps and returns to the main menu, the
proper storage has not been "cleared."  Go into BASIC and type: CLEAR 256,58000
to remedy this problem.

How to Use Pop-Up: Just press the GRPH and CODE keys simultaneously and the 
time, date, and number of bytes free will appear on the top of the screen.  
Press the space bar and the display returns to normal.

How to deactivate Pop-Up: Just do the same thing you did to activate it.  The 
program toggles between active and inactive states everytime the program is 
run.

The Future of Pop-Up: As you can tell, this program has more potential.  I 
would like Pop-Up to be an on-going project.  For example, I would like to see 
a calculator mode in Pop-Up.  Please let me know of your suggestions and if 
you'd like to help in the development of Pop-Up, (I'd be glad to have some help
).

Notes on Proper Usage:
ALWAYS USE CAUTION WHEN USING THIS PROGRAM.
Always make back-ups of important files.  Pop-Up works with most programs, but 
may not work with them all.  Test Pop-Up before using it with sensitive data.  
Improper use of Pop-Up can result in "cold starts."  I recommend deactivating 
the program when it is no longer needed, to prevent any surprizes.

I have the following warnings when using Pop-Up with the built-in programs.  Do
not use Pop-up with TEXT when you are selecting a block which includes the 
first line of the display.  Do not use Pop-Up when WAIT appears in BASIC. The 
number of bytes free displayed when Pop-Up is called from TEXT is not correct (
it always displays a number less than 200).

This version of Pop-Up will not restore graphics or reverse video on the first 
line. (Do people really have a need for this, the program would take more space
to implement this)

Please let me know if you find other problems or find a way to fix these.

Enjoy!
