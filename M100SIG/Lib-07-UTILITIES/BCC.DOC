=======================================
   THIS IS A REWRITE OF THE BCODE ,IT
USES MUCH LESS MEMORY BECAUSE IT USES
A TRANSLATION TABLE. THE TABLE IS ACT-
UALLY A STRING OF 60 BYTES,THE HIGH NI-
BBLE DEFINES ARRAY B ,WHILE THE LOW NI-
BBLE WORKS ON ARRAY S. PARITY FOR THE B
ARRAY IS GENERATED ON LINE 150 .A VALUE
OF 255 IN THE TABLE REPRESENTS A NON-
PRINTABLE CHARACTER.
   LINES 700 AND UP CREATE A 60 BYTE 
FILE (A$) ,AND MAY BE TRASHED AFTER IT
IS RUN , OR THE PROGRAM CAN EASILY BE
MODIFIED TO READ THE DATA DIRECTLY FROM
THE DATA STATEMENTS (IF YOU'VE GOT MEM-
ORY ), AND IT WILL STILL USE FAR..FAR
LESS SPACE .
   YOU WILL HAVE TO CREATE THE FILE --
PDATA -- ,WHATEVER IS CODEABLE WILL BE
PRINTED FROM THIS FILE.
   LINES 320-328 WERE CORRECTED FROM 
THE ORIGINAL , AS THEY DID NOT WORK.
