DMP220 -- Graphics Dump to CGP-220

Copyright 1983  Michael M Rubenstein

DMP220 dumps the TRS-80 Model 100
screen, complete with graphics, to a
TRS-80 CGP-220 printer.  DMP220 is
designed to be incorporated in BASIC
programs.

Two versions are available -- a BASIC
version and a machine language version.


Including BASIC Version in Programs

A BASIC program using DMP220 must

    1.	not have any line numbers
	greater than 64999

    2.	not use the variables HH%, II%,
	JJ%, KK%, or LL%

DMP220 must be an ASCII file in RAM,
on cassette (CSAVEd with the "A"
option), or read in from the RS232 or
modem interface.  To combine with your
BASIC program, use one of the commands

    MERGE "DMP220"
    MERGE "CAS:DMP220"
    MERGE "COM:xxxxE"  (xxxx is the
			RS232 spec)
    MERGE "MDM:xxxE"   (xxx is the
			modem spec)

as appropriate.


Using BASIC version

The initialization routine must be
executed exactly once, before any
use of the screen print routine, by

    GOSUB 65000

To print the screen, use the statement

    GOSUB 65100


Installing Machine Language Version

The machine language version is
distributed in hex format.  To install
it, first load DMP220.HEX onto the
model 100 (as a .DO file).  Then run
HEXLDR.  Respond to the request for
file name with

    DMP220

There will be a pause for several
seconds while HEXLDR creates the
DMP220.CO.


Using Machine Language Version

To use the machine language version,
you must first reserve space for it
with the statement

    CLEAR 256,61936

(of course the first number is the
string space required and may need to
be changed for your application.)

Then load the .CO file with

   LOADM "DMP220"

Now at any point, the screen may be
printed by

   CALL 61936

When done, the space used by DMP220
may be recovered by

   CLEAR 256,MAXRAM
