This file is an improvement, or at least an alternative, to MASTER.BA.  Like 
MASTER, it is a patchwork quilt of several programs, mostly items borrowed from 
DL.

An improvement of this version is the use of the function keys as the MASTER 
MENU, rather than input numbers.  Perhaps a later version can have this feature 
for the printer set-up???

Lines 0-6 are the introduction and MASTER MENU.

The function keys, codes and subroutines are as follows:

F1 DMPS lines 7-19
This portion is for Dot Matrix Printer Setup (DMPS).  The commands will set up 
the following:

PRINTER SET MENU (PICK 1)
1=NLQ, 10 PI
2=small print, reg.
3=NLQ, small type
4=WIDE PRINTING
5=Draft printing

Item 1 is for Near Letter Quality (bold or enhanced) at 10 spaces per inch.

Item 2 is for compressed type

Item 3 is for compressed type Near Letter Quality.

Item 4 is for WIDE or elongated printing.

Item 5 is for draft quality, which is the DMP105's default setting, so is a 
null, in that it merely returns you to the MASTER MENU.  You may wish to rewrite
this portion to enable the selection of 12 pitch type???

F2 MAIL lines 20-35
This portion prints mailing labels from filename CAS:MAIL.DO.  It's advantage is
that no RAM is used in the storing of the mailing address information.  This is 
used in conjuction with choice 2 or 3 on DMPS to allow for slightly longer 
address lines.

F3 NAME lines 36-49
This handy file allows one to collect names for mailing lists, etc.  Put your 
M100 out on a literature table or, as I've heard some do, pass it around at a 
meeting to take attendance.  Input lines can be changed if different data is 
desired.  Keep it by the phone for telephone inquiries!

F4 SORT lines 50-59
This subroutine sorts a RAM .DO file in ascending order.  Works pretty fast!

F5 TFND lines 60-67
This subroutine functions like FIND and LFND in ADDRSS and SCHEDL.  The 
differences are that it can be applied to any RAM .DO file, not just ADRS or 
NOTE, and that the results are placed in filename RAM:NEWFIL.DO.  Line 61 can be
amended to change the destination.  Sometimes I change it to RAM:NOTE.DO in 
order to do further searching.

F6 CHEK lines 68-97
This subroutine will verify a .DO tapesave.
F7 LOAN line 98
This single line subroutine will compute monthly loan payments given the 
principle amount, the length of the loan in years, and the percent of interest.

F8 MENU line 99
Returns you to the M100 MAIN MENU.

All subroutines, save F7, return you to MASTER MENU upon completion.  F7 returns
you to BASIC, from where F4 will return you to MASTER MENU and F8 will return 
you to MAIN MENU.

THANKS TO THE VARIOUS CONTRIBUTORS TO DL WHOSE FILES HAVE BEEN BORROWED FOR USE 
IN THIS PATCHWORK QUILT!!!

THANKS TO TO SYSOPS (ESPECIALLY DAVE AND TONY) WHOSE HELP HAS BEEN AS GREAT AS 
THEIR PATIENCE!!!
