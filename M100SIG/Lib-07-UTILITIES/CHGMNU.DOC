     CHGMNU.BA is a MENU utility for the M100/102 and T200 which lets you 
customize your main MENU four ways:
     -You can rename any of four built-in ROM routines: TEXT, TELCOM, ADDRSS, 
and SCHEDL.
     -You can keep their names but change the addresses stored in the MENU to 
CALL some other appropriate stored .CO or ROM routine.*
     -You can change both name AND address and avoid wasting fixed, "top line" 
MENU space for unused "factory" routines. This also reclaims RAM file slots 
lost to "CALL" programs that wander around the MENU as you add and kill files. 

     -You can make any of the "factory" programs invisible on the Main MENU.
-
     CHGMNU.BA works by coding a new name and/or address into your choice of 
the four MENU locations used by TEXT, TELCOM, ADDRSS or SCHDEL. The changes 
will remain in place until YOU change them by re-running CHGMNU or a Cold 
Start, whichever comes first. (CHGMNU includes a routine to restore the default
values WITHOUT a Cold Start if you prefer.) There's no need to keep CHGMNU in 
RAM: just keep it handy for use now and then as your MENU needs change. It is 
simple to use but, as with all CO/ML CALL coding, you MUST follow the 
instructions!
     Download CHGMNU.DOC (this file), CHGMNU.BA, edit the flotsam, and CHECKSUM
IT! Save a .BA version for future use. Cursor select CHGMNU.BA from the Main 
MENU.
     After you've read ALL of these instructions answer Y to the first prompt. 
To Change one of these MENU references press C. To Restore the four "factory" 
names and addresses press R. 
     To rename or readdress any of the four built-in MENU locations press C. To
change a file's visibility on the main MENU press V. (Any of the files that are
currently invisible will display in reverse video.)
     If you press C then choose T, E, A or S (which correspond to the 
"original" entries). Type the new SIX character name, (symbols and spaces are 
OK), and press <ENTER>. Now CAREFULLY enter the address where you would 
normally CALL your routine and press <ENTER>.
     (If you're ONLY renaming the built-in routines press <ENTER> for the 
default address. For safety reasons, if you're changing the name of an ALREADY 
re-named slot, pressing ENTER here will reinstall the factory address 
previously called at that location. You should therefore re-enter your "custom"
address along with the "new" name.) Your entries will then be displayed for 
final review. (DOUBLE CHECK THE ADDRESS! It MUST be either the address that 
displays next to the "Exe:" label when you LOADM the program to be called or 
some other DOCUMENTED entry point!) If you are satisfied then press Y, 
otherwise N.
    * NOTE: THIS NEW MENU ENTRY WON'T DO ANYTHING BUT CALL AN ADDRESS! IT 
DOESN'T CLEAR ANY RAM, NOR DOES IT LOAD THE PROGRAM! IT WILL ONLY CALL AN 
ADDRESS!  IF THE ADDRESS YOU HAVE ENTERED IS *NOT* A PERMANENTLY STORED .CO or 
ROM ROUTINE YOU RISK A COLD START SHOULD YOU SELECT IT FROM THE MAIN MENU!
     CHGMNU will now return you to the Change/Restore prompt: choose C or R to 
continue or, if you're finished, press <ENTER> for MENU. When you return to the
main MENU you will see your "custom" name in place of the "factory" name. When 
you cursor select that name you will jump to the address you specified. CHGMNU 
only changes one location at a time. Continue in CHGMNU if you have other 
routines to enter.
     If you pressed V, then by pressing T, E, A or S you will make that 
routine's MENU entry invisible. It can, of course, still be used by CALLing it 
from BASIC or a program. If you want to repeat the process for another routine 
simply press "C", "V" again at the entry menu. To make them visible again 
follow the same procedure: selecting the corresponding entry "toggles" it's 
visibility. Picking Restore at the first menu will clear all custom code and 
restore all factory names and addresses.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     That's all there is to it. I have used it to: add DSKMGR to the "top line"
instead of ADDRSS which I never use; change the address for TEXT to run through
TXT-OV first, (A permanently stored version, NOT the Alt/LCD version!); change 
"TELCOM" to XMODEM to jump directly to XMDPW5 etc. I'm certain other options 
will occur to you. Remember to carefully manage RAM to protect any .CO programs
which you CALL from your custom MENU. If you select a program from your custom 
MENU that ain't there it's the same as CALLing an unloaded program: usually a 
certain COLD START! 
     I found the seed for this idea in ADSMTR.DOC by James Yi. I hope you find 
it useful too!
