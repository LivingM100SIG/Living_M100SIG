   This program performs the same function as LOAD.COM in CP/M.  It converts
Intel HEX format files to Model 100 .CO files and it does so very slowly.
   The filename ext .DO is assumed and may be left off.  The addresses being
loaded to are printed out (every checksum block).  This is not what slows it
down.  I believe it needs to have a machine language routine for the HEX-ASCII
conversion, which I can supply if there is any interest.
   This program was my answer to getting assembly language routines in my 100
from my CP/M machine where I write them.  There is also a crude UNLOAD, crude
in the sense that it currently accepts address ranges and not .CO filenames for
conversion.
   Before LOADing a program the addresses must be known and BASIC restricted
from them with the CLEAR command else conflicts fatal to BASIC or the .CO
output file will result.  A modification of the LOAD program without the POKEs
would calculate the addresses of any unknown .HEX file.
   I'll be glad to answer any questions: John Chenoweth 71716,1642
