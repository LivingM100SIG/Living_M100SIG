Documentation for UTLTY1.BA, UTLTY2.BA and UTLTY3.BA
----------------------------------------------------

UTLTY1.BA thru UTLTY3.BA are function key driven utilities for the M100/102
(ONLY!).  UTLTY1.BA is the full program and the other two are smaller,
reduced-capability subsets.  The full version is described here.

When you run UTLTY1.BA from your menu, you will see eight function
key labels, as follows:

1) Name -- facilitates renaming programs on the M100/102 menu

2) Kill -- makes killing programs much easier, and stuffs the keyboard
   buffer to let you kill BA files and stay in the program

3) Dir -- gives you a directory of all files in the computer, including
   the paste buffer and memory reserved for loaded CO programs; see
   FILEN.DOC (DL7) for interpretation of the output

4) Unused

5) Unused

6) Pset -- provides set-up capability for Epson printers (program can be
   edited to change the limited selection offered)

7) Lnfd -- toggles the built-in code to add line feeds to printers that
   need them (e.g., an Epson that you also use with an IBM-type computer).
   If you have been using LFUTL.PW1, disable it and use this one (if you
   are using this program)

8) Menu -- returns you to the M100 main menu.  Hitting <ENTER> key will
   do the same.

At any level of the program, hitting <ENTER> will take you up one level in
the menus.

Compared to the above, UTLTY2.BA is lacking the Pset function, and
UTLTY3.BA has both Pset and Lnfd removed -- for users of other printers.
Starting with UTLTY1.BA, you can mix and match on your own.
