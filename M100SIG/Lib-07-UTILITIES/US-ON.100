US-ON.100 -- Fred Edelkamp [70506,223]
 This is a 72 byte BASIC program that will switch between the 40X8 and 60X10
screens when using ULTRASCREEN (TM). The program will also tell from the Main
Menu which screen is active.
 To use this utility CUT out the BASIC line at the end of this text file and
PASTE it into BASIC. If the 60X10 screen is active call the program "US-ON.BA".
If the 40X8 screen is active call the program "US-OFF.BA". To use the program
return to the Main Menu, and place the cursor over US-xxx.BA. The screen will
clear for a second, the screens will switch and the name of the program will
be changed to reflect the state of the program. If you get a FC Error it just
means the name was wrong when you ran the program and it should work properly
from then on.

The BASIC program:
