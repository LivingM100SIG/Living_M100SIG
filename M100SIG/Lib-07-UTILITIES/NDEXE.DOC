NDEXE.DOC -- documentation for
NDEXE.100 and NDEXE.200

NDEXE loads and runs machine language programs that are stored on Node Ram
 disk.  The program run is not created as a file in memory, but directly
 loaded into its load address and executed.

NDEXE.100/200 is a Basic loader that creates NDEXE.CO for Model 100/200.
Run it to create NDEXE.CO.

If the ML program runs in HIMEM, HIMEM must be properly set before running.
If it runs in AltLCD buffer, it can still be ran, even though NDEXE itself
runs in AltLCD.

When you run NDEXE, it prompts with
"NDexe: "
Then enter the name of the ML program on the Node disk; if the name of the file
ends with ".CO", you can omit the ".CO"
If the file exists, the name of the file, Top addr, Length, and Exe
 addr prints on the screen and is executed, else you are prompted again
 until you enter the right file name or press <CR> to exit.

NDEXE must exist as NDEXE.CO in memory.  It must not be renamed.

NDEXE can be called from BASIC with the calling parameter specifying the
 file name.
Because screen output can erase NDEXE after it's LOADMed, it must be called
 before any screen output is done.
The call address is 64707 for Model 100, 63411 for Tandy 200.
Here's a small program that lets you choose a program to run from a menu
instead of typing it each time.
You can add your own file names at DATA lines 300-.  The last DATA item must be
 "0", indicating end of list.

Note: This is for 200 only.  It will not work on a 100 because the LOADM statement causes all variables
 to be cleared on a 100.
