   Append to the paste buffer! Now you can accumulate material from many parts
  of many files, and retrieve it all with a stroke of the PASTE key. You also
  get a  choice of word-wrap "on/off" as you enter a file. The pgm is m/l and

  promise of the wand has never been fully realized, it does have

  PSWRD.RAD is a short BASIC program designed to provide a degree of file

  that logs the time & date and then shuts off your computer. The password is
  "go"(lower case),but you can enter your own in line 40. You must IPL the
  program to run it correctly and it will not interfere with any programs in
  RAM. SHIFT-BREAK or ^C interrupts the program so security is not 100%.

  UTLPW2.100 is  created from UTILTY.100. The Cload and Csave functions have
  been deleted. New functions are Filn and Prnt, implemented by embedding
  FILEN.100 & PRINT.100 in the program. Note that Prnt is configured for Epson
  printers and uses emphasized print (change line 77), with form-feed at end
  of file. The advantage of this is storing multiple utilities under one menu
  entry. Of course, you can add to, delete or change the utilities included
