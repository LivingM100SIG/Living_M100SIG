Documentation for KEYSAV.100
============================

KeySav.100 is a listing of a utility
that can be used with most business
programs that make use of the 'Macro
Key' definitions of the Function keys.
These routines will:

	1.  Save the current def's of
	the function keys into a
	variable (AZ$); and

	2.  Restore the function key
	codes stored in the variable
	AZ$ back.


Please not that this utility is not
necessary for programs such as "RFU" or
"DIARY" or any other program that uses
the 'Interrupt' abilities of the
function keys.  These programs can be
identified by the fact that the
function key definitions are NOT
alterred after utilizing these
programs.


Use:
====
This utility is only an example of how
the keys may be saved.  The line in the
program labelled "0" must actually
exist in the program after any CLEAR,
MAXFILES, or LOADM statements, so that
the value of AZ$ will not be altered.

Any statements such as MENU, POWER OFF,
END, etc. must be prefixed with "GOSUB
65500" to reset the function keys.


Any questions on the implementation of
this routine may be sent to:
