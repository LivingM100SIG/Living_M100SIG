                         Documentation for HELLO.100

  Run HELLO.100 as is to see some different screen displays.

  What the program contains:

  1. Four LCD screen frills that can be used to enhance your programs

  2. A small, about 100 byte Password program

                                MODUS OPERANDI

  Password program    Lines 100 - 112

  Security program that will not accept any keyboard input, including
  SHIFT/BREAK

  To use this segment (Password) only:

  Cut & paste lines 100 - 112 into Basic or Text, I'll assume you know how
  to do this & save as .BA prgm.

  Line 102 (GOTO 200) add a line (200) if you want LCD message - if not
  delete line 102

  e.g. 200 BEEP:PRINT@90,"PASSWORD PLEASE"

  RUN it from Menu & hit any key. This will power off your M100. When M100
  is turned on entry only alowed with password.
