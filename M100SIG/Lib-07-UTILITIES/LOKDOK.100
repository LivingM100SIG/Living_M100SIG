LOK.100 is a three line program that will keep those spies out of your files 
for good - all except those clever hackers who always seem to get in anyway!

Most security programs (including all I've tried on the SIG!) can be defeated 
by using the reset button followed by the break key when the Top Menu 
momentarily appears on the screen (try it if you don't believe me). Commercial 
programs may have licked this but...then...they cost money too!

LOK.100 takes this "back door" and makes it the only door. As soon as you run 
it, it powers off. Turn on the computer and it powers off again! The only way 
in is to quickly use the reset button and then the break key - and even that 
takes a little (but only a little!) practice.

LOK.100's password is the ultimate password: no password at all!

INSTRUCTIONS:

.L15
1. Before running LOK.100, delete line 10.

2. To lock, run LOK.100 from Top Menu. M-100 will immediately power-off.

3. To start unlock sequence, first switch on, then immediately press reset 
button.

4. IMPORTANT: Do not press reset DURING switch-on - this will cause a COLD 
START!

5. If you do nothing else, Top Menu will flash once and M-100 will immediately 
power-off.

6. To prevent this, press SHIFT/BREAK during the split-second Top Menu appears.
If you time it right, you'll reach the OK prompt in BASIC.

That's it! I tried it on many of my M-100 friends, among them some hackers 
extraordinaire. The psychology of LOK.100 worked liked a charm. It seemed the 
more clever they were, the more they kept looking for that front door that 
wasn't there!

Of course, now that everyone knows the secret, well...shucks!
