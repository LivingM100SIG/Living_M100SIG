PSWORD.100 - PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION.
PSOWRD.100 is a "BREAK" resistant, personalized password program for the model 
100. It is resistant to the usual "BREAK" key, CTRL-C, SHIFT-"BREAK" key 
sequences and the reset button! It will also display your name and a personal 
msg of your choice. To personalize it, put your name in place of <JAMES T. KIRK
> in line 400. You may also put a personal msg or your job, company, etc., in 
line 400 where it says <CAPTAIN OF STARSHIP ETC.>. You may also remove the <> 
brackets for a neater display. Remove lines 1-28 and compress the pgm to 
conserve memory. (Actual pgm is from line 100-1100.) This pgm uses a two-level 
master key stroke and password protection scheme. The POKE disables the the 
BREAK key at the start of the pgm and re-enables it at the end. The pgm also 
scans the keyboard input to trap the SHIFT and CTRL key entry thereby 
eliminating the CTRL-C or SHIFT-BREAK sequences that would ordinarily halt the 
pgm. The pgm defines itself as the warm-startup pgm with the IPL command, thus 
making itself resistant to the RESET button! The special character in quotes in
line 800 is made by pressing the GRPH and SEMI-COLON (;) keys at the same time.
You may change this master key stroke sequence by using the GRPH or CODE key in
conjunction with any other key to replace it with a new character. The master 
key stroke must be entered BEFORE you can enter the password. The password 
length is in line 900 inside the parantheses. If you change the password 
"KALIFI" in line 1000, you must make sure that the value inside the () in line 
900 equals the number of characters in the password. Remember that upper case 
letters are different from lower case letters as far as the computer is 
concerned. Therefore, you must enter the password EXACTLY as it is stored in 
the pgm! The pgm should be SAVEd as a Basic file called "PSWORD". If you wish 
to use a different file name, you must substitute your file name for 'PSWORD' 
in line 100.
