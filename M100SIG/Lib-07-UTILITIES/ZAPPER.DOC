Documentation for ZAPPER.100, by Henry Glover, 72256,2564

ZAPPER is a purger program which allows you to rapidly clean out any unwanted
files in your main menu.

Before running the program:

1. Replace the file names in program line 1, following DATA, with as many -
or as few - file names of your own which you wish to keep permanently stored in
your memory bank, each separated by a comma.  File names without extentions
must be followed by a period, ie UR-2. - otherwise be sure to insert the full
file names - including extension, ie .DO, .BA or .CO.
2. Two empty slots in the main menu are needed to run the program.
3. Files named "X.DO" or "Y.DO" are incompatible with the program and will
be deleted.

Running the program:

The program does not employ function keys.

1. Pressing A (All) selects all of your files to be deleted.  (ZAPPER will not
be killed by the program.)
2. Pressing Z (Zap) also selects all of your files to be deleted - but excludes
those files you have designated in program line 1 to be permanently resident
in your memory bank.
3. For selection of individual files, which may include files listed in
program line 1, use the following protocol:

          For files you wish to save, the cursor is advanced by
          pressing the space bar.
          
          Pressing K (Kill) selects files to be deleted (which remain
          in reverse video) and advances the cursor to the next file.
          
          Pressing R (Reverse) allows you to change your mind and
          reverses the KILL or SAVE choice selected for the previous
          file, placing the cursor on hold over the current file
          position.

4. After you have selected all the files which you want deleted - either
individually by pressing K, or as a group by pressing either A or Z -
one press of Q (Quit) triggers the sequential deletion of all files marked
by reverse video.  No files are killed until Q is pressed!  It is not necessary
to run the cursor through the entire list of files before pressing Q - in
this instance the file marked by the last position of the cursor and all
subsequent files will be saved.
5. Pressing S (Start) starts the whole cycle over again - S can be pressed at
any time.
6. Pressing M (Menu) at any time returns you to the main menu with all files
intact.
7. File size is depicted in the lower left corner of the screen, and a
running record of bytes released and free bytes is also recorded at the
bottom of the screen. Bytes free will increase as you select each file to be
killed to keep you informed of the aggregate free bytes available at the
time you press Q.

Comment: The Waite Group publications were an invaluable source reference for
portions of this program.
