     SEEFYL.BA is a FAST, simple-to-use, 661 byte, 100/102/200 menu utility 
that provides a unique package of two very useful options.
     - You display and can change the visibility of ANY directory entry other 
than BASIC.
     - You can re-name ANY directory entry (other than BASIC) with ANY 
combination of characters, with or without an extension. Be creative: use those
graphics characters!
     In addition to keeping "working" programs off the main menu, these 
features enable you to protect critical resident programs because invisible, 
non-standard, lower-case and/or extensionless filenames are almost impossible 
to kill!
-
     Download SEEFYL.BA and SEEFYL.DOC. Checksum SEEFYL.BA as a .DO file: then 
LOAD it and SAVE it as a .BA file. Save a backup copy somewhere.
-
                           OPERATION
-
     Cursor select SEEFYL.BA from your main menu. You will see a "prompt-
reminder" line at the top of your screen and your first directory entry 
displayed. If the file is invisible on your normal menu it will display in 
reverse video here.
-
     ENTER will display the next file name.
-
     TAB will let you toggle between invisible (displays in reverse video) and 
visible (normal video).
-
     BKSP will let you re-name your file with ANY combination of characters. 
You may enter up to EIGHT characters WITHOUT a period or NINE characters 
INCLUDING the period: in either case, the right two characters will be 
considered the extension. SEEFYL immediately re-displays your "new" filename. 
If it's not OK just press BKSP and start again. When you're satisfied, use TAB 
as necessary and press ENTER to continue.
     NOTE: To change any "non-standard" filename you'll need to re-run 
SEEFYL.BA.
-
     ESC will return you to the main menu at any time.

          -------------------
-
     I keep SEEFYL.BA in RAM as an invisible utility for normal house-keeping 
and on DISK as a back-up. It can be run equally effectively from RAM or DISK.
