                                  FKEYS.100 

                                DOCUMENTATION 

    M100 Specific as is (line #60 has Calls for Default Function Key Set Up). 
I'm  not  familiar with the 102, 200, or 600, but would think the program will 
work if proper calls are placed in this line -  or  just  delete  line  #60  & 
enter any other key set up you desire. 
    Originally, I used one set for arithmatic symbs,i.e., * / + - etc. 

Please customize to your needs. 

This  program  just  enables  the  Function Keys & has no bearing on Operating 
Systems (TDD, MUNK, CAS, etc) 


    Re: menu option #3 - the F1, F2, & F6 keys are the same for  Powr-Disk  or 
Powr-Dos. 

All  Powr-Disk  & Powr-Dos key functions (menu #1 & #3 are in UPPER CASE) when 
'Label' key is engaged. 



    To make any changes see: 

Menu #1 - Lines 50,51,52 (can be squeezed into one line) 

Menu #2 - Line 60 (M100 Default) 

Menu #3 - Line 70,71,72,73 (can be aqueezed into one line)
