The program LFUTL.PW1 has caused problems for some SIG members who
use M/L programs.  To eliminate this difficulty (caused by a 
'CLEAR256,MAXRAM' statement), I suggest all past and future users 
change line 8 to read: 8 MENU, before running the program. This 
change will eliminate clearing high user RAM and will also avoid 
resetting your clock to 1984 (ok now, but not for long).
