    Here is yet another post cold start utility for both users and non-users of
the Chipmunk disk drive.
     It's features include:
  1. Numeric only entry of date & time
     (no special characters needed).
  2. Turns sound off
  3. Sets POWER to CONTinuous
  4. Erases ADDRSS & SCHEDL from menu
  5. Sets dial speed to 20 pps
  6. Adds LF to Telcom
  7. Sets F6 to KILL "
 
     And for the Chipmunk version:
          (See note below)
  8. Sets F7 to CALL0  (Reset CDOS)
  9. Kills itself when finished
 
 If you're at all familiar with basic, making any desired changes to the
options should be pretty easy. If you
run into any problems *PLEASE* let one
of us know!

 NOTE: For Chipmunk users, you must name the program: COLD.BA to allow it to
kill itself. If you wish to disable this option, delete line 7
