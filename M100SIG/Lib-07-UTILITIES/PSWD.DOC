Using PSWD.CA 1/14/85 by Rick Perry [75665,1045]

   PSWD.CA is a BASIC program which will create a machine language file,
pswd.co, that provides a simple password protection scheme for entry to
Lucid and .CA calcsheet files.  The pswd.co file will automatically be
created & relocated to any 'End' address you desire using PSWD.CA and
will be set up with a password of your choice, up to 30 chars long. 
Note that the file in this database called PSWD.CA has a .CA extension
only to call attention to it for Lucid users -- it is really a BASIC
program that you download and store on your M100 as PSWD.BA.  Its
operation is based on a hook in Lucid that can CALL HIMEM+2 under
certain circumstances (see PSWD.ASM for technical info).

   Upon running PSWD.BA you are prompted for 'End address' for pswd.co
file to be created; this defaults to MAXRAM-1 (usually 62959).  Press
ENTER to use the default value, or type in the desired value (one less
than 'Top' address of any code which you normally keep permanently
resident above HIMEM).

   After loading the machine code and verifying the checksum, the
program will prompt for 'New Pswd:'.  Enter up to 30 chars which will
become your password (encoded into the pswd.co file) for entry to Lucid.
It does not matter whether you enter the password in upper or lower
case, since the code automatically converts your password to uppercase.
The 30 char length restriction arises from the fact that Lucid uses part
of the LINE INPUT buffer for its own purposes.

   After entering your desired new password, the program will display
the 'Top' address of the newly created pswd.co file (result will be
62876 if 'End' address was 62959).  HIMEM will now be equal to this
'Top' address and the password code will take effect upon entering Lucid
or any .CA file from the Main Menu.  If you enter the wrong password at
the 'Pswd:' prompt, you will go back to the M100 Main Menu.  You no
longer need the PSWD.BA file (unless you want to change your password)
and may delete it from RAM.


Summary of use of pswd.co:

   For the Lucid password code to be effective, the pswd.co file must be
loaded into RAM and HIMEM must be equal to the 'Top' address of pswd.co.
If for some reason HIMEM is altered and you wish to reset the password
protection, go to BASIC and enter LOADM"pswd" (if you get an ?OM error,
then type CLEAR 256,xxxxxx where for 'xxxxxx' you substitute the 'Top'
address of pswd.co as shown on the screen after the LOADM command, then
do LOADM"pswd" again).  HIMEM must be equal to the 'Top' address of
pswd.co for the password protection to be effective (check it using
PRINT HIMEM, if it's not right use CLEAR 256,xxxxx as described above).

   The Lucid password protection can easily be removed by typing from
BASIC: CLEAR 256,yyyyy where 'yyyyy' is any value other than the 'Top'
address of pswd.co.  For extra protection against the removal of the
password code you can use the program MAXRAM.BA from DL4 (also see
MAXRAM.DOC) to set MAXRAM equal to the 'Top' address of pswd.co after
LOADMing pswd.co.  This will prevent HIMEM from being reset above the
new MAXRAM value, but the pswd code can still be removed by entering
commands such as CLEAR 256,HIMEM-1 and restored by entering CLEAR
256,MAXRAM.  Thus, the intention and probable use of this pswd
protection is only to help prevent accidental (or malicious) entry to
your .CA files by co-workers, family members, etc. and does not provide
complete machine security (such as SECURE.CO from Secure Systems, Inc.
[71256,545]).
