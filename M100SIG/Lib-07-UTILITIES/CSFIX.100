CSFIX.100  Cold Start FIX Program

This file describes a program for recovering .DO files after a cold start 
without the use of cassette tape recorder, external computer, or modem.  The 
procedure is so simple you can do it anywhere.  It works, provided you run it 
before any BASIC editing.

Other programs/procedures either require that you back up your files 
periodically (preferably just before the cold start hits you), or require an 
external device, which you will probably not have when and where you need it, 
such as at your seat on an airplane, etc.

  PCSG RESTOR is a nice machine language program that they give away, but
    you must load it from the cassette to use it, recovers only .DO files.

  DUMPER.100 by Rick Perry is a nice program, but requires a cassette,
    recovers only .DO files.

  RECOVR.DOC,101 by Russ Villanueva  recovers both .DO and .BA files
    but it also requires a cassette.

  RECOVR.CLD by Larry Gensch uses another computer to hold the data,
    recovers only .DO files.

I got this program and procedure from Peter at P. G. Design, to whom I am 
indebted.  Type the program in and run it right after a cold start.  Do not 
perform a BASIC CLEAR -- it will set most of memory to nulls, and you will not 
recover anything.  Do not "Edit" using that BASIC function -- it also will set 
most of memory to nulls, and you will not recover anything. You can backspace 
to correct errors, and you can retype the line entirely if you have already 
pressed ENTER when you see the error.  You may LIST the program, if you wish.  
Then retype the line that contains an error.

10 OPEN "FILE.DO" FOR OUTPUT AS 1
20 FOR A = 33000 TO 62000
30 PRINT #1, CHR$(PEEK(A));
40 NEXT A

Then press F4 to RUN and wait, about 5 minutes.  The program copies most of 
memory to a RAM file, "FILE.DO", and you can then use the TEXT program to CUT 
and PASTE the text you wish to save, pasting into other files that you create. 
(First delete some garbage, .BA files at beginning of FILE.DO, to make room).

Write or print the program listing and tape it inside the M100 battery cover 
and you will always have it with you.

This will recover .DO files only but you could try a modification of RECOVR.101
to recover .BA files (probably not the one in lowest memory, however.

Peter's program starts at 33000 so it does not try to recover itself.  The RAM-
to-RAM transfers move up in memory together, so they never interfere with each 
other.  Someone clever will soon figure out how to do this with just a few 
pokes into the directory area, but this works fine and takes just a few minutes
longer.

Peter learned not to "Edit" the program by putting a logic analyzer on the 
backplane buss.  When he started the "Edit" function, he could watch the M100 
address nearly all of memory, setting it to nulls.  The same applies to other 
programs: if you Edit DUMPER.100 instead of retyping a bad line, you will 
recover nothing.

Thanks to Peter!
