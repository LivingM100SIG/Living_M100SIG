 Documentation for RLCLDR (ReLoCating LoadDeR)
 Part 1: Loading RLC format files
 
   As the number of machine language programs for the 100/200 increases, it 
becomes increasingly desirable to use more than one m/l program at one time.  
The problem is that they all seem to want to occupy the same area of memory.  A
program stored in RLC format (uses modified hex coding) can be loaded into any 
memory address.
 
   This program will produce machine language at any desired memory address 
from an RLC file or produce an RLC file from an existing m/l program.
 
 
 CHANGE FOR TANDY 200
   For the Tandy 200, substitute the following for line 4:
 4 CLS:PRINT:FORY=-3403TO-2908STEP11:IF(PEEK(Y)AND192)
=192THENFORZ=3TO8:PRINTCHR$(PEEK(Y+Z));:NEXT:PRINT"  ";
 
 
 LOADING RLC FORMAT FILES
 
   Before loading a file, you must decide where to put it.  The first number on
the first line of an RLC file is one less than the length of the machine 
language.  Let's say the number is 833.  If you have no other m/l loaded, go 
into Basic and type ?MAXRAM-833-1.  The answer may be, for example, 62126.  
Write this number down.  You then need to type CLEAR256,62126 and then run 
RLCLDR.  If you have existing m/l which is to stay loaded when the new m/l 
program is being used, you would load the new program at Top-833-1 (where top 
is the lowest address of the existing one) and clear memory accordingly.
 
   When you run RLCLDR you get three choices; Load, Save, or Menu.  Pressing 1 
or L will start the Load.  (Pressing 3, M or F8 will take you out of RLCLDR.)  
After pressing L or 1, you see a list of .DO files in the memory.  Type the 
name of one of these to load it or just press enter to re-start RLCLDR.  The 
next prompt is "Start address."  Enter the address you just figured out.  If 
everything goes okay, after awhile the computer will beep and print "Done."  Go
to the menu and you will see the program saved as a .CO file.  If you plan to 
leave the new program loaded in high memory, you can kill the .CO file.
 
   One of two error messages may appear with two beeps when attempting a load:
   "Memory not clear" indicates that you are attempting to load below HIMEM.  
You need to do a CLEAR256,xxxx where xxxx is the address where the program will
start.
   "Checksum error.  File is bad." indicates that there is some error in the 
RLC file you are trying to load.  Try loading the .DO file again before re-
running RLCLDR.
