

Sometimes a program, especially when using INKEY$ to check the keyboard, is 
sensitive to the position of the CAPS LOCK and NUM keys.

This 1 line routine can be used to check both keys.  After returning from the 
routine, check value CL.  If CL AND 32=32 then the CAPS LOCK is off, if 0 then 
it is on.  If CL AND 16=16 then NUM key is off, else it is on.
