HELP-DO.TXT Copyright Howard Allen Cohen 1985.  Permissions granted to

This file contains all documented Supera commands and enhancements.  It should 
be loaded as HELP.DO in your M100 and used by either reading it as a text file,
printing it for reference, or best of all, getting "on-line" help by hitting <
esc>6 while working on another text file if SUPERA is active.

This file was written and uploaded by Howard Allen Cohen, ppn 72416,710, 
without any prompting or reward (so far!) from Micro Demon, publisher of 
SUPERA. David Sumner did like the idea, tho. 
I had trouble uploading this file in its orginal form, which had lots of tabs 
to make it look nice. I took all or almost all of the tabs out and replaced 
them with <-> and <;>. You may use the search and replace function of SUPERA to
substitute for these symbols. At this point, I don't think SUPERA allows search
and replace with things like tabs, CRs, etc. This would be a nice enhancement. 
I have a word processor for a different machine which allows this and it is 
very useful.  How about it, David?

As a "bonus," at the end of the file are the control codes for PRINT found on 
this SIG.  I have these in my HELP file for obvious reasons, altho I have not 
yet used them.  This file will be a little bigger than 2760 bytes before you 
delete my introduction.
