            HOTKEY: Escape Artist
            Burn up your keyboard with simple, two-key commands.
            by Mike Nugent
            
                  HOTKEY is a little utility that performs some special
            magic with simple, two-key commands. Whether you're in
            BASIC, TEXT, ADDRSS, SCHEDL, or Detroit, this mini-Houdini
            can:
            
            * Display the current day, date, and time
            * Automatically type the day, date, or time
            * Send a form feed to your printer
            * Offer a choice of five-space or eight-space tabs
            * Turn itself off
            
                  It can be customized, uses only 379 bytes of RAM, and
            as a bonus, even fixes the Model 100 "date bug." Sound good?
            Then on with the show!
                  First, the program must not be modified, except that
            remark lines need contain only the line number and the
            apostrophe (or REM). Save the program to RAM as HOTKEY.BA
            (it expects that name!). And save it to tape or disk as
            well, as a backup for later use.
                  CAUTION: Because HOTKEY uses machine language,
            mistakes here can vaporize your files. Before proceeding,
            backup anything important! 'Nuff said.
            
            INSTALLING HOTKEY
                  To install HOTKEY, first kill all other .BA programs
            except PG Design's MENU.BA, Micro Demon's SUPERA, and Tri-
            Mike's DVORAK, if you use any of those. Note that some BASIC
            programs don't show a .BA extension (for example, Traveling
            Software's UR-2, RANDOM, TWORD+). When in doubt about a
            file, kill it. Now run HOTKEY.BA. It installs in less than a
            minute, shrinking itself to 379 bytes, then returns to the
            main menu, ready to use. If you get a Load Error message,
            see the LOAD ERROR section below. Never edit the installed
            HOTKEY.BA! You can list it (it will look weird), but don't
            edit it!
            
            USING HOTKEY
                  To turn HOTKEY on, just run it. The menu quickly
            returns, and HOTKEY.BA disappears. Why? So you can't kill
            it. Killing it while it's active can cause a cold start. It
            will reappear when you turn it off.
                  HOTKEY commands work anywhere except TELCOM's Term
            mode and the main menu. To execute a command, press ESC
            followed by the appropriate key:
            











                  Hotkey Meaning
            
                  ESC-V   (View) Display day/date/time on top line until
                                 any key is pressed
                  ESC-D   (Date) Type current date in MM/DD/YY format
                  ESC-T   (Time) Type current time in HH:MM:SS format
                  ESC-W   (Week) Type day of the week, e.g., "Mon"
                  ESC-F   (Form) Send form feed to printer
                  ESC-O   (Off)  Turn HOTKEY off
                  ESC-TAB (Tab)  Five-space tab
            
                  The Date, Time, and Week commands actually type the
            information as though it came from the keyboard. The View
            command only displays it on your screen. The Form command
            sends a form feed, CHR$(12), to the printer or beeps if the
            printer isn't ready. This is handy for printing multiple
            files to a buffered printer. Pressing ESC-F after each print
            command ensures that your files are separated by form feeds;
            no need to wait until one report has printed before printing
            the next one. Whereas the normal TAB types a tab character,
            CHR$(9), ESC-TAB types the necessary number of spaces to
            produce a five-space tab. The Off command turns HOTKEY off,
            beeps to acknowledge the command, and makes HOTKEY.BA
            visible again on the main menu.
            
            EXTRAS
                  Have you met the notorious Model 100 date bug, the
            one where, for no apparent reason, it's suddenly next year?
            HOTKEY ends this game of musical years and keeps you solidly
            planted in 1988 (or whatever year you're actually living
            in). Each year, you can change the last data item in line
            580 to match the current year.
                  You can customize some features of HOTKEY. If you
            prefer date and time in the shorter MM/DD and HH:MM format,
            change the 9 in line 840 to a 6.
                  To change the printer character the Form command
            sends, replace the 12 in line 880 with another value. A
            value of 15, for example, puts some printers into condensed
            mode.
                  Though I don't advise it, changing "238, 8" in line
            600 to "127, 127" leaves HOTKEY visible when active. It will
            appear on the menu as +OTKEY.BA, the + being an extra
            safeguard against its accidental demise. But many DOS's and
            utilities can easily zap it and blow your machine off into
            the weeds.
            
            LOAD ERROR
                  Packing machine code into a .BA program (as HOTKEY
            does) can be a complex affair, because you can't predict
            where the program will reside in memory. Since the values of
            certain bytes depend on the program's location, sometimes a
            byte contains a value BASIC misinterprets. The Load Error
            message warns you of such a byte. You must move the code
            higher in memory, a byte at a time, until all the bytes are
            acceptable to BASIC. Here's how:












            
            1. Type NEW and press ENTER. Type KILL "HOTKEY.BA" and press
               ENTER.
            2. Load a fresh copy of HOTKEY.BA from disk or cassette, and
               save it to RAM as HOTKEY.BA.
            3. Edit line 10. Insert an X right after the REM, making it
               REMX.
            4. Edit line 110. Change the +5 to +6
            5. Edit line 2000. Change the +5 to +6.
            6. You've moved the program up one byte in memory.
            
                  Try running it again. If it still fails, repeat steps
            1-6, inserting another X (for example, REMXX) and adding 1
            more to the numbers in lines 110 and 2000. Keep repeating
            these steps until it works. One or two X's usually does the
            trick. If you've added 5 or 6 X's, I suggest you carefully
            double check your program listing for errors.
            
            COMPATIBILITY
                  Compatibility with other programs depends on how they
            handle a system vector that HOTKEY uses:
            
            1) TS-DOS likes it just fine.
            2) There's no conflict with MENU.BA.
            3) It's completely compatible with DVORAK (of course!).
            4) SUPERA turns HOTKEY off, and vice versa, so use them one
               at a time.
            5) Ultimate ROM II (v1.22) cooperates with a few exceptions:
                 a) UR-2 programs exit to the main menu rather than to
                    UR-2's menu.
                 b) After using HOTKEY's View command with UR-2's VIEW80
                    activated, the screen clears completely. Scrolling up
                    or down restores the missing lines.
                 c) CTRL-J, CTRL-O, and CTRL-L functions of UR-2's TEXT
                    are disabled with HOTKEY active. To reenable them, turn
                    HOTKEY off via its ESC-O command.
                 d) After exiting a text file from UR-2, the main menu
                    shows TEXT as TEXT. (with an added period).
                 e) These problems appear to be harmless so far, but be
                    cautious. With any new software, make frequent backups
                    until you know what works with what.
            6) Ultimate ROM II (v2.07 and v2.12) are incompatible.
            
            FUTURE POSSIBILITIES
                  I meant HOTKEY to be a small, simple utility. But
            with all those other keys on the keyboard just begging to
            become part of HOTKEY's repertoire, I wasn't sure when to
            stop adding commands. I can easily imagine HOTKEY growing
            larger and more powerful in the future. If you'd care to

            ATTENTION TANDY PORTABLE DISK DRIVE USERS!
            
                  Tandy's FLOPPY is fatal to any .BA program containing
            machine language, including SUPERA, MENU, DVORAK, and now
            HOTKEY. Fortunately, you can patch FLOPPY to prevent it from
            moving .BA programs around in memory. I've published the
            patches in Portable 100 magazine.
                   Model 100/102 users with the PDD-1 (original 100K
            drive) should refer to the Sep. '88 P100, p. 22; Tandy 200
            users with the PDD-1 should refer to the Nov. '88 P100, p.
            15.
                  Although those articles also show PDD-2 (200K drive)
            patches, those were further improved and appear in the March
            '89 P100, p. 6. All PDD-2 users should refer to that
            article.
