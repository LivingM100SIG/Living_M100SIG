                      SUPTIP.001 -- Toggling a Hidden SUPERA
                      --------------------------------------


        A bit of investigation shows that the CALL address to toggle
        SUPERA v. 2.5 from Basic is to 34425 decimal.  For SUPERA v. 2.0,
        the equivalent address is 32823.
         
        This information is useful if you keep SUPERA invisible (to avoid
        the disaster of killing it while it is "on"), but still have a
        need to turn it off -- or turn it on if it is toggled by other
        software.
         
        We can now keep a short (11 byte) toggle program on the menu,
        which can be killed without ill effects.  The program (I call it
        SUPRA.BA) is:

             o For Version 2.0:

                  1 CALL 32823

             o For Version 2.5 (use with PGD 0MENU):

                  1 CALL 34425

        This answers a question I was asking -- and solved using a
        disassembler and MONTOR.BA.  Perhaps all the other SUPERA users
        have known this all along!
