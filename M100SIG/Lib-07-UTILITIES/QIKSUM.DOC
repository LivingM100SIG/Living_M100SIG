QIKSUM.100                        checksum 36,143                     09/07/88

QIKSUM.100 is an ASCII file from which to load QIKSUM.BA, a BASIC/ML hybrid
which rapidly counts the checksums of .DO files in RAM. To get a copy,
download QIKSUM.100 as "QIKSUM.DO" and eliminate any non-program stuff up
front and at the end that may accumulate with the download. Next, enter BASIC
and type ' LOAD"QIKSUM" ' (RETURN). When 'Ok' appears, type ' SAVE"QIKSUM" '
(RETURN) and you've got it, ready to save to tape, disk or other mass storage
device for future use.

Using a .DO file nearly 11,000 bytes long as a benchmark, a similar BASIC
program required over two minutes to complete a checksum of 484,878. This
program reported the same ASCII sum in just a few seconds.

QIKSUM.BA occupies 634 RAM bytes, and loads its ML code from $DAC0/56000
through $DB3E/56126. Enjoy!
