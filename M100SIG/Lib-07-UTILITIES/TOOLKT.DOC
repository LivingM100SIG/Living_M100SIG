         General Instructions
---------------------------------------
(1)  TOOLKT will RELINE-PACK-LIST- CHECKSUM-FYTE a basic program stored
in Ascii (.DO) format. It will RESET function keys; facilitate DATA entry to
any DATA file; and automatically resets DATE$ to "86" (Line#1)

(2) RELINE & PACK create TTEM for temporary storage, and will at
conclusion KILL the object file and RENAME TTEM with the object file name.

(3) Only LIST and CHECKSUM can be used with Cassette Files. If so, file NAME
should be preceeded by CAS: and RECORDER should be at ready prior to
naming the file.

(4) All options (except REKEY) begin by requesting the .DO file. In DATA
you can name and open a NEW file but all other options require you to NAME
an existing file.  It is not necessary to use the .DO extention.

(5) Both LIST and Fyte require your PRINTER to be on line, and assume
continuous feed paper.

(6) If the reserved string space is inadequate for a particular object file
it can be increased for FYTE in Line#71 and for all other options in Line#25.

(6) Excising particular applications or other customization is not recommended
as the options are heavily integrated and in addition to obvious subroutines
the program has numerous branches between functions.  If you run FYTE on
TOOLKT.PMS you will have a schematic of the branching to assist you.

---------------------------------------
                RELINE
(1) ReLn will renumber program lines and match them to GOTO,GOSUB,THEN
ELSE,RESUME,RUN & RESTORE branches, including multiple ON XXX GOTO/SUB.

(2) You are first asked to exclude from renumbering lines at the top and bottom
of your program, and then the increment of the new line# and the start Line#.

(3) The program will not prevent you from using a configuration which will
result in the renumbering of lines which will result in new line#s which
are higher than bottom line#'s not to be renumbered. i.e. if you exclude from
renumbering all line#>=100 and have 20 line less than that and you specify
increments of 10,starting at 10--Your first 20 lines would be 10 to 200
and the origional lines>=100 would be left intact. Be Careful!

(4) The program will prevent specifying a starting line# which is less than the
LINE# of bottom excluded lines. i.e. You can specify exclusion of line#=>100
and specify the start line# at 150.
---------------------------------------
                PACK
(1)  Will remove blanks not imbedded in quote marks.

(2)  After file selection you will have the option of removing REM statements.
If selected will remove entire line if the line is solely REM. Be CAREFUL of
those program which branch to REM line.
---------------------------------------
                LIST
LIST prints a formatted listing of a BASIC program breaking lines at each
semicolan not imbedded in quote marks 
---------------------------------------
                FYTE
(1) Will assist in fyteing the byte. It first compute the number of unpacked
and REM Bytes, files size, line length and average line length.

(2) It will then determine for each Line the Line# of every line which
BRANCHES TO IT.

(3) Finally it will print a report with this DATA which can then be used to
fyte the byte as your own programming technique dictates.

(4) In program like TOOLKT which use the word REM in other than REM state-
ments, you will get an inacurate REM count

---------------------------------------
               RKEY
RKEY resets function keys, allocated string space, himem, and maxfiles to
the M100 default status.
---------------------------------------
               DATA
(1) DATA will open for APPEND a new or existing data file and allow a single
line entry to that file.

(2) The single line may be formatted: NAME:456-1234: or delimited: XXX;XXXX

(3) Can be used for regular data entry but conceived to facilitate programmer
in creating sample data for program tests.
---------------------------------------
               CSUM
Along the lines of Woods Martins program, will evaluate the total of the
ascii value of every character in a program.  Be sure to delete all
extraneous characters
