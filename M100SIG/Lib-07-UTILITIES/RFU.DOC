The  RFU program started as a package of 
utilities  written in the early days  of 
the Model 100.  It was later refined and 
considerable    effort    expended    in 
producing  a  series  of  articles   for 
"Portable  100".  Part of the series was 
published, but the status of the rest is 
unknown at this time.

The file uploaded here,  RFU.BAS, is the 
final  compressed and optimized  version 
that   I  still  use   myself.   It   is 
functionally identical to the one in the 
series, but is smaller and a bit faster. 
No  documentation is offered,  since the 
program was designed to function as much 
like the standard 100 menu as  possible. 
For  information on the internals of the 
program consult the articles.

AT.BAS,  the second part of the RFU set, 
should  be  stored in your  computer  as 
'@.BA'.  If  you follow this  convention 
RFU  will  always save that  file  first 
when doing a cassette backup.  AT.BAS is 
the   "restore"  program   that   brings 
everything  back from the  cassette,  so 
having  it first on the backup  cassette 
is  very convenient.  This program  also 
needs  no documentation.  To restore RAM 
from  a cassette backup created  by  RFU 
you  simply CLOAD (no name required) and 
RUN. All else will be done automatically 
while you wait. Ain't automation grand?
