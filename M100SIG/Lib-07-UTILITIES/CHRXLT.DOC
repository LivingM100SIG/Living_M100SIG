Documentation for CHRXLT.BA, a Character Translator
---------------------------------------------------

CHRXLT.BA is a text file character translator for the Tandy
100/102/200.  It goes through a text file and replaces designated
characters by specified replacement characters.  I wrote it as
part of the process of developing a tool to translate T-WORD files
into Wordstar files (i.e., translate the embedded print codes).

The translation tables are inputted in line 100-120.  Line 100
specifies the number of characters to be converted.  Line 110
identifies the input file characters (decimal representation) to
be converted, and line 120 specifies the new values in the output
file.  Lines 110 and 120 must both have the number of entries
specified in Line 100.  Input/output files can be from any device,
RAM being the most obvious one.

In the uploaded program the translations are:

 A -> ^A, B -> ^B, ..., I -> ^I and the reverse of each.

A typical four-line test file is:

AB
^A^B <create by CTRL-P,CTRL-A,CTRL-P,CTRL-B>
CD
^C^D <create by CTRL-P,CTRL-C,CTRL-P,CTRL-D>

With the default data statements, the order within line pairs
(1,2) and (3,4) will be reversed.

Certain characters will give some interesting results when
converted -- one example being ^J = CHR$(10), which is a linefeed
(the little "triangle" you see at the end of each line on your
screen will be processed).

I'm not sure that this program "as-is" has any real practical
applications -- but it may have.  Please report any you come up
with!
