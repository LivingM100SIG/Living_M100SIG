HEXLDR -- Intel Format Hex Loader

HEXLDR loads an Intel format hex file
as  a .CO file on the model 100.  This
format is used by a number of
assemblers, including the standard CP/M
ASM.

To load a hex file, simply run HEXLDR.
You will be prompted for the name of
the file (the .DO is not necessary).
It may take several minutes to load;
be patient.

After loading, there will be a .CO file
with the same name as the .DO file.
The machine language program will also
be loaded and ready to run.  HIMEM
will be set to reserve space for the
machine language program.  Remember to

	CLEAR 256,MAXRAM

when you are finished running the
machine language program to recover
the space.



Known Deficiencies:

- HEXLDR requires a 24k system to
  operate.

- The checksum included with each line
  in the HEX file is ignored.  This
  should be corrected in a later
  version.

- The first address loaded must be the
  lowest address used.
