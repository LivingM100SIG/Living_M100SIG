  In the past, M100 owners were limited to a handful of suppliers that carried
the very specialized 8k RAM modules that cost about $20 - $30 and somehow Radio
Shack was selling for over $100.00. That problem doesn't exist for the Model
102.
  Below is a list of ram chips that should work with the M102. Some
intrepid folk opened up their brand new units to find that they come stock with
several different brands of chips, so it's reasonable to assume that the
standard cross references should apply.

  The ones mentioned on the message board were the NEC uPD4364-20L and the
Hitachi HM6264A-15.

  Notes:
 1. I will use a small "u" to denote "micro". The M100 character for that
    symbol will not upload to CIS.
 2. (Mil.) = Military temperature range
 3. (Monolithic) and (Modular) = Packaging difference.
    Otherwise identical pinout and performance.

  Armed with this information you should be able to find the lowest priced RAM
for your M102. Prices vary; I was quoted $3.99 and $8.80 for the two I checked.
  Others have found them as low as $2.00.
  If a reliable, easy source turns up, I will update this file with that info.

UPDATE:
        Since I wrote this file, we have purchased a T102 at work. I tried to
get a RAM from Tandy to no avail. They make you leave your computer with them,
they send it to a service center, it is returned to the store, and you are out
$40.00 and about a week of use of your computer.
  I have better use for my time and
money. I have found that Purple Computing (they specialize in M100
products) has the chip in stock and is selling them for $5.00 + 3.50 shipping.
Call 800-732-5012 for orders only or 805-987-4788 in California for orders and
customer service.
  I can't recomend this, but in all fairness I should mention that you can
get the chip from Radio Shack National Parts using the number AX-260-3817.
   800-433-5543 toll free.
   817-870-5600 within Texas.
  I was told that delivery runs 3-4 weeks.
         Happy RAMing,
