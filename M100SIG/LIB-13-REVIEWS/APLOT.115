AUTOPLOT is a program for plotting data using the TRS Model 100 and the small
color graphics printer CGP115.  The program is powerful, fast and easy to
use.  I was able to plot a set of X,Y paired data 15 minutes after opening
the package.  (However I was hung up for over an hour trying to plot two or
more curves on the same plot...the DOC's didn't tell me that the curves must
have an equal number of points.  It is easy to provide dummy points once you
know they are necessary.)
    Options are chosen from a very clever menu.  Axes are automatically
scaled or may be selected manually.  The axes may be marked with hash-marks,
extended into a grid, or suppressed.  Data may be plotted in MANY forms
including curve, dash, box and bargraph.  Even "mark and range," with
three data points defining a vertical line and mark is provided, e.g. for
HI-LOW-CLOSE.  Lines, bars etc can be produced in different colors using the
four ball point pens of the CGP115.  Equations with two or more variables
are easily graphed.
    A single curve with axes is executed in about 30 seconds.  Labelling takes
longer but is fun and versatile.  A Text menu allows you to enter the text
string, size, color, emphasis, direction etc.  The cursor keys are used to
position the starting place for the text, then hit <ENTER> to print it.
Any number of labels may be printed on one graph.
   The standard graph measures 3 1/4" x 4 3/4".  Options permit square and
smaller graphs.  Graph quality is excellent if you keep a supply
of fresh pens on hand.
    The program loads into 10,511 bytes but expands into 15,358 bytes while
drawing one curve with 12 points, into 18,574 bytes drawing two such curves.
    My only complaint is with the DOCs, which are generally good but do not
cover all kinds of plots.  The X-axis placement of the colored bars on the
bargraph plot is neither intuitive nor explained...you must experiment to get
 the desired result.  I called the author to find out how to enter the
three Y-values required for "mark and range, (easy...just enter them)!  The
author was most helpful, and the program more powerful than I had expected.
    I am not the vendor, but in 3/84 I paid $39.50 + $3.00 S&H for this
program, which more than lived up to my expectations.  (Satisfied Customer)
