Tandy 200 - The Legend Continues

William T. Walters
Portable 100, Feb. 1985

   Just as the Model 100 revolutionized the way we thought about 
portable computing - indeed, proving that those two words were not 
necessarily mutually exclusive - the new Tandy 200 promises to be a true
second generation of the family.

   Few who saw - and used - the Model 100 weren't impressed by it.

   Those who weren't either were die-hard MS-DOS aficionados or people 
who believed they needed bigger displays and more memory than the 100 
provided.  Okay, folks, Tandy couldn't do much for those enamored with 
MS-DOS portable computers, but everybody else had better hang onto their
pocketbooks!

   The Tandy 200 is built on the history of the 100.  Everything that 
most of us liked about the 100 is even better on the 200.  Some of those
things that many of us felt were missing on the 100 are built into the 
200.  Plus a few neat tricks to boot.  Light weight and true portability
- the very things that made the 100 revolutionary - are neither 
sacrificed nor compromised in the process.

LOOK AT THE 200'S FEATURES.
- Flip-up Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) 
with 16 lines of 40 characters each;
- Built-in 300 baud telephone modem with softwear selective tone or 
pulse dialing;
- 24K Random Access Memory (RAM) standard, expandable to 72K;
- 72K Read Only Memory (ROM) standard, expandable to 104K;
- RS232 Interface, programmable from 72 to 19200 baud;
- Parallel Printer Interface;
- Bar-Code Reader Interface;
- Powered by four AA alkaline or rechargeable nickel-cadmium (nicads) 
batteries;
- Six built-in software packages for word processing, communications, 
appointments, address list, spreadsheets, and programming in Basic;
- Uses all Radio Shack Model 100 accessories.

   Although at 2.25 inches in height the 200 is .25 inches taller than 
the Model 100, the rest of the dimensions remain the same: 11.75 by 8.5 
inches.  The added height at the rear of the unit is to steady the flip-
up LCD.

   The 200 weighs in at 4.5 pounds, and is decked out in a no-nonsense 
color scheme of black and white, or fawn grey as Tandy calls it.

   The processor used in the new Tandy is an 8-bit 80C85 and only can 
address a total of 65,536 (64K) locations of memory at any one time.  
The built-in programs are stored in a total of 72K-bytes of ROM.

   The operating system plus application programs (except Multiplan) 
occupy a total of 40,960 (40K) locations, leaving 24,576 (24K) locations
addressable for RAM.  These two values add up to the limit of the 
addressing capability of an 8-bit processor, 64K.

MULTIPLAN.  By a novel arrangement, the Multiplan program is contained 
in a separate 32K ROM, and not the main 40K ROM.  When executed it 
switches out the main 40K ROM to prevent conflicts.  Also, there's room 
for another 32K ROM, like in the Model 100.  In this case, however, a 
CMOS Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) will work.

If this expansion ROM is installed, its name also will appear on the 
main menu (a complete reset of the unit is required), and if invoked, 
it'll swap out the main 40K ROM.

  The 100 expansion ROM socket required the use of a custom manufactured
circuit that generally wasn't available.  The 200 expansion ROM will 
accept a new CMOS EPROM which can be programmed in quantities as small 
as one.

   Note that the 200 can't program EPROMS.  That requires special 
equipment.  Also, the programs in this expansion ROM must be in pure 
machine language, not Basic.  However, since Multiplan is installed 
inside the unit, in the same size and type ROM, I predict ROM-based 
software from Radio Shack and other vendors in short order.

RAM BANK SWITCHING.  Text files and program files created by the user 
occupy RAM.  The basic 200 comes with a total of 24K-bytes RAM.  RAM 
expands in increments of 24K.  Each expansion module costs $249.95 from 
Radio Shack.  In the memory-expansion compartment, located on the bottom
of the unit, there are three memory-expansion sockets.  Two sockets are 
for additional 24K banks of RAM and one socket is for the 32K expansion 
ROM mentioned earlier.  The 200 provides the capability of 
electronically selecting one of the three segments (banks) of RAM at any
time.

   This capability provides greater overall RAM size, but any program or
file can't be larger than 24K total.  Also, the 200 doesn't have the 
ability of allowing a file or program to overflow from one bank of 
memory into another.  But then, neither does any other battery-powered 
portable computer.  The good news is all expansion memory, both RAM and 
ROM, is installable by the customer.

BIG, FAST DISPLAY.  You're first struck by the large sizes of the 200's 
display.  It shows 16 lines by 40 big characters plus dot-addressable 
graphics.  The LCD has only two positions, either opened or closed.  
It's easy to read at normal viewing angles and there's a small knob for 
contrast adjusting.
   The scroll display  is greatly improved from the 100 version.  It 
features its own controller and receives information from the processor 
serially.  This dedicated controller improves the performance of the 
display and results in faster, smoother scrolling.  When, for example, a
Basic program consisting of 50 lines of 38 characters each is listed on 
the 100 (beginning with a clear screen), the complete listing takes 17 
seconds, or about .33 secon per line.  This same operation on a 200 
takes six seconds.

COMFY KEYBOARD.  The keyboard is a comfortable typewriter style layout 
with an added row of small pushbutton keys above the regular keyboard.  
These extra keys provide special functions and commands used in the 
200's programs.  Plus, a group of four keys controlling the cursor are 
full-sized keys formed in a diamond keyout.

   Since the display folds up from the keyboard, both keyboard and 
display are protected from dust when not in use.  This also allows the 
keyboard to be located physically closer to the bottom of the unit.  One
doesn't have to stretch his hands to type as is necessary with the 100.

THINGS PRESENT AND FUTURE.  Like the 100, the 200 has been designed with
the most common peripheral interfaces already built in.  Also, 
connections to these peripheral devices have been well thought out.  The
200 uses the same cables and peripherals currently being sold by Radio 
Shack for the 100.  (The one exception is that instead of using a 
fragile 40-pin integrated circuit-type socket inside the unit, Radio 
Shack  used a small 40-pin female connector located at the rear of the 
cabinet along side the rest of the connectors.

   Accessories sold by companies other than Radio Shack, such as Holmes 
Engineering's Bullet and Portable Computer Support Group's Portable Disk
Drive, will require new software specifically for the 200.  This is 
because the internal operating system has changed and one of the 
locations for machine-language routines was left in the same place as on
the 100.

  This requirement has had an impact on Radio Shack, too.  Both the Bar-
Code Wand and the Disk/Video Interface (DVI) require new software to 
work with the 200.  Also, changing the bus connector causes the DVI to 
require a new cable just to connect to the 200.

   Current estimates by Radio Shack executives slate software 
availability for both items in 60 days.  The cable for the DVI should 
also be available at the same time.  I've seen the DVI connected to a 
200 and have had an opportunity to put it through its paces.  Let me 
tell you, it's nice - especially with its full-sized 80 by 25 Multiplan.


NEW DVI.  The new DVI software can reside in any or all banks of RAM and
takes about 5.5K of space.  It also lets the user know when it's loaded 
by adding DISK/VIDEO code installed under the bytes-free prompt when 
entering Basic.

   If the size of this code takes you aback, remember it only needs to 
be loaded into one bank of RAM at a time, and then only will work with 
information in that bank.  The 5.5K area of RAM used can be reclaimed 
without destroying any files and that's a real plus compared to the 100 
version.
 
   Later, is you want to reboot the DVI code, you can after a quick poke
command, followed by pressing the reset button.  All of this is not as 
straight forward or as easy as it could be, but as least the capability 
has been provided to regain that precious RAM without destroying files. 
If you own a Model 100 and use these items, you should ask at your store
for ordering and pricing information on the new software and cable.

SWITCHES AND CONNECTORS.  The left side of the unit has a switch to 
select the use of acoustic cups or direct-connect cable for the modem 
and the bar-code reader connect.  Across the rear of the cabinet are the
1500 baud cassette interface (the cassette interface has been improved 
through software and is more reliable), the modem connector, the new 
system bus connector for RS232 and a well-recessed reset button.

   The right side only has the connector for the AC adapter (same 
adapter as for the 100) and a dial which adjusts the contrast level of 
the LCD.  The on-off power switch is now a push button and is located 
above the keyboard in the left corner.

   Housed on the bottom of the unit are two compartments and one switch.
  One of the compartments is for memory expansion and the other is for 
batteries.  The switch is labeled memory power and turning it off 
removes power from the built-in nicad batteries.  These batteries power 
the 200's memory when main power is off and will retain any stored 
information for approximately 15 days in the case of a 24K RAM unit 
after the operating batteries are exhausted.

   In normal operation these small batteries are kept constantly 
recharged by either the AC adapter or from a trickle charge from the 
operating batteries.  If the memory power switch is in the off position,
the unit won't operate.  It's left in the on position except when 
storing the 200 for extended periods of time.

POWER UP.  The battery compartment is adequately labeled and the owner's
manual states that nicad AA batteries are usable "after slight 
modification by Radio Shack."  Originally, there was to be a switch for 
selection of battery types.  Now to prevent any possibly 
misunderstanding on the part of the customer, a specific setting inside 
the unit is required.

   This modification consists of connecting two jumpers inside the unit,
installation of a screw which closes the battery compartment, and a seal
placed over the screw.  This seal warns you to replace batteries only 
with rechargeable nicad batteries.  Why?  When nicad batteries are 
installed, use of the AC power adapter will cause them to recharge.  
That's good.  However, if voltage from the AC adapter was applied to 
standard nonrechargeable alkaline batteries, they could explode.  That's
bad.

   How long does each type of battery last?  Standard alkaline batteries
will power the 200 for about 25 hours without any external devices 
connected.  Nicad cells will give about 5 hours under the same 
circumstances and require 15 hours to recharge.  Since the 200 can be 
operated while recharging from the AC adapter, this short operating time
won't be inconvenient.  The modification costs $15 and will require you 
to leave your unit at least overnight.  Radio Shack prices calculate 
$8.78 for a set of nicads and $2.99 for a set of alkalines.  It doesn't 
take long before that adds up to a set of nicads.  I intend to have that
done first thing on my machine.

SIX-SHOOTER.  The applications software built in are still the key to 
success and the 200 has a few slick tricks locked up inside.  The 
software has been produced by Microsoft and at first glance, is 
identical to the 100.  Not so.

   The six built-in programs are shown on a single menu that has space 
for 46 files or programs.  As on the 100, a shadow cursor indicates 
which file or program is to be selected.  When this shadow cursor is 
moved over a user file, the next to last line will display the length in
bytes (characters) of that file.  The last line of the display shows the
commands Bank, Copy, and Kill.

   Pressing Bank will shift you to the next available bank of memory if 
one is installed.  Each bank maintains its own menu of files and each 
bank is competely separate from other banks.  Copy is used if you have 
one or more optional banks of memory to make a duplicate copy of a file 
in another bank.  This is very useful for managing your limited memory 
space.  The Kill function will erase a file only after asking you if 
you're sure you want to erase.  This is a nice touch when you consider 
the action of killing a file is irrevocable.

ALARM PROMPT.  There are two new software features completely unique to 
the 200: the Alarm and the Calculator functions.  I'm particularly 
enthusiastic about the alarm capability.  Alarm can function in one of 
two different ways.  First, it can store a single day/time to turn on 
and run any specific program.  This has application for remote data-
retrieval installations or unattended calling and connecting to other 
computer systems.  The second is the capability of keeping track of up 
to 255 different alarms, along with one-line message prompts.

   If I wish to be reminded of my wife's birthday, I can make the 
following entry into the NOTE.DO file:

   04/21/85  09:00:00,A, Don't forget the Birthday Tomorrow!

   The entry consists of four distinct parts.  A date which consists of 
two digits, for month, day and year each separated by a slsh mark (/).  
The time must be in 24-hour format of hours, minutes, aand seconds 
separated by a colon and is followed by a comma and a capital A to 
indicate Alarm.  The next comma indicates the start of the message which
can't be longer than one line or 40 characters.

   If the 200 is turned off, it beeps loudly for 10 to 15 seconds and 
turns on, displaying the message on the bottom line of the LCD in 
flashing normal then reverse lettering.  If any key is pressed, the 
flashing message disappears.  Should I not be close-by, the 200 will 
turn back off when the automatic power-off time elapses (default is 10 
minutes) and the next time I turn it on, the alarm prompt will display.

FOUR FUNCTION CALC.  Many people have said they feel very silly having 
to sit with a pocket calculator beside their computer.  The problem is 
that if you're using the computer for almost anything else, it isn't 
easy to get it to add, subtract, multiply, or divide.

   Not so anymore!  A simple four-function calculator can be called to 
the top line of the display at any time by pressing the NUM key followed
by the GRPH key.  It's dismissed by pressing the GRPH key again.  With 
the NUM key locked down you get a pretty fair simulation of a 10-key pad
- even to redefining the O as +, the P as - and the ; as *.  These 
reassignments mean you don't have to use the shift keys to generate 
those math operators.  It's neat and more useful than I had originally 
dreamed it could be.

WORD PROCESSING.  The Text program is a small text processor which, due 
to its size, doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a dedicated word
processor.  The 200 version of Text is almost identical to the 100 
version.  Both allow continuous typing and will automatically wrap words
as they read the end of the display without splitting.  All eight 
function keys are assigned duties that make Text easy to use.  The only 
function key that is different from the 200 version is the F4, or List 
key which invokes the List Manager program for operation on the text 
file.

   The PRINT key is also changed.  It still serves a dual purpose; by 
itself it causes the text currently on the LCD to be printed just as it 
appears on the LCD.  If, however, you depress and hold the SHIFT key and
then press PRINT, a large pop-up menu appears.  This new menu allows you
to set the line length, left margin, number of lines per page, number of
lines to print per page, and top margin.  It even asks you if you want 
to pause after each page.  Page numbering along with headers and footers
are still missing.  But any way you look at it, it's one heck of an 
improvement from the 100 version that only gives you line length as an 
option.

   All printed output from the 200, just like the 100, has as a line 
terminator a carriage return only.  No line feed character is ever sent 
since all Radio Shack printers expect to receive only carriage return 
without a line feed.  This feature eliminates a number of good printers 
that are available from non-Radio Shack sources.  It didn't take very 
long, however, for someone to figure out a small patch-type program that
would fix this problem on the 100.

   The program to do it was put on CompuServe's Special Interest Group (
SIG) bulletin board in a matter of weeks after the Model 100 was 
introduced.  It probably won't take long for someone to figure out how 
to do the same thing on the 200, too.

TELECOMMUNICATING.  The communications program which is included with 
the 200 is called Telcom.  It, too, is very similar to the earlier 100 
version.  The Telcom instruction manual is a separate book and goes into
great detail about information services and ways to access them.  This 
information should help first time users understand what services such 
as Dow Jones, The Source, and CompuServe are.  It also explains that 
communications networks such as Tymenet and Telenet are separate 
services used to connect to the information providers.

   The manual is quite thorough and contains very explicit instructions 
for connecting to Dow Jones and CompuServe as well as to other systems. 
The draft I reviewed didn't go into much detail on connecting to other 
personal computers, but Radio Shack executives said additional 
information would be included in the final manual.

   Running Telcom brings up a screen which shows the settings for the 
serial communications channel, a prompt indicating that you're in 
Telcom, and labels the function keys.  The communications settings now 
include four extra parameters.  The only functions assigned which are 
different from the Model 100 version are:

Stat - allows altering of the communications settings.  You have the 
capability to set various word length, parity, number of stop bits, 
enable or disable X-ON/X-OFF flow control, even mask unwanted control 
characters, and add or strip line feeds at the end of each received 
line.  These last two features were missing from the version in the 100 
and are a welcome addition.  Originate or answer and tone or pulse 
dialing also are selectable through software control, another change 
from the 100 version.

Brk - causes a break sequence of 250ms to be sent.  Just as a control-C 
character is sent to services such as CompuServe to signal for 
attention, a break sequence is sent to quite a number of mainframes to 
signal attention or to disconnect.  The 100 didn't allow this signal and
was unusable with quite a few mainframe systems.

LIST MANAGER.  The 200 has one mini data-base manager and it's called 
the List Manager.  The List Manager is the core program executed by the 
Schedl and Addrss, and Text programs.  Both Schedl and Addrss preset the
text file that is to be used to the name of a specific file.  A number 
of 100 owners said they wanted to be able to use the Schedl program with
any text file.  Their goal was to be able to create a number of smaller,
specialized lists that could be used to contain specific information.  
That capability is included with the 200.

   Text has the F4 key assigned to LIST and selecting it will cause the 
mini data-base program to be executed.  The data file it will use will 
be the current file being accessed by the Text program.  Another nice 
touch.  The owner's manual gives a pretty good explanation of this as 
well as the Schedl and Addrss programs and several samples are included.
  Schedl and Addrss program functioning is identical to the same 
programs in the 100 with one exception; F4 is marked EDIT and causes the
Text program to be entered with the appropriate file, all ready to add 
or change information.  When you enter Text this way, pressing F4 again 
will return you to the program it was entered from.  This way, you don't
have to be jumping back and forth to the main menu to add or update the 
information file that's being used.

PORTABLE MULTIPLAN.  The last program included with the 200 is Msplan.  
Yes, a protable-sized Multiplan, and it's impressive.

   As a test, I took several medium-sized spreadsheets in a Model 4 and 
created a special type of file called SYLK (SYmbolic LinK).  This means 
that Multiplan examines the spreadsheet and creates a text file with all
the necessary information for it to be sent to another computer.  Then, 
using Vidtex on the Model 4 and Telcom on the 200, I loaded in the SYLK 
and presto.  They all worked.

   I'm truly impressed that such a small portable could have an almost 
complete implementation of Multiplan already installed.  Now you can 
carry your spreadsheets around just about anywhere you like.  That 
feature alone ought to excite more than a few who yawned at the Model 
100.

FUNCTION KEYS.  Since this is a portable implementation, the limitations
are 63 columns by 99 rows.  Believe me, that's pretty hefty and bigger 
than anything I loaded in.  If you're familiar with Multiplan, about the
only change you'll have to get used to is using an equal sign when 
entering formulas.  Everything else is the same, from named data 
references to a full-featured set if intrinsic commands.

   The function keys provide the capability to:
 -Edit - lets you edit the contents of a cell.
 -Blnk - replaces the contents of a specified cells with blanks.
 -Copy - duplicates the contents of a cell or group of cells.  Secondary
options are right, down, and from.
 -Form -changes the display format or width of one or more cells.  
Secondary options are cell and width.
 -Name -assigns a name which can be used to identify one or more cells 
in a command or formula.
 -Opt  -selects various options including automatic or manual 
recalculation and mute or beep on errors.
 -Tran -loads a worksheet into memory, saves active worksheet to 
cassette or disk, clears the current worksheet or moves the cell 
pointer.  Secondary options are load, save, clear, and goto.
 -Exit -exits Multiplan and saves the active worksheet to RAM.

COMMAND KEYS.  Three command keys are also in Multiplan:
 -PASTE -inserts rows or columns in the worksheet before the specified 
cell.
 -PRINT -prints the current window as displayed on the LCD screen.
 -<SHIFT>+PRINT - prints all or a portion of the active worksheet.

   Don't think this is just a miniature version of the real Multiplan.  
Except for mutiple windows and iterative calculations, this is the real 
McCoy and, boy, is it nice!

MICROSOFT VARIATION.  The version of Microsoft Basic which is included 
remains unchanged from that of the earlier Model 100 except for one 
command extension.  To test this I logged onto CompuServe and went to 
the Model 100 SIG data base of prgrams.  These programs have been 
written by users of CIS and the SIG and most have been contributed to 
public domain.  This large wealth of programs is available free or 
nearly so since you have only to pay for the CIS connect time.

   I used the Telcom download function to retrieve 15 different 
programs.  The only criteria I used was that a program couldn't contain 
any Poke or Call commands since the 200 ROMs are different from the 100 
ROM.  Every program, functioned perfectly.

   Going one step further, I opened my drawer full of Model 100 cassette
programs.  Again, a random sampling of programs was made with the same 
criteria-except I gave up after 10 programs.  The results?  Same.  
Perfect operation.

POWER AUTO-EXECUTE.  The power command has been extended and when used 
will set an internal alarm that will cause the 200 to power on and 
execute a Basic program at the specified time.  As mentioned earlier, 
this has some nice potential for control or monitoring applications as 
well as sending information to a remote computer system late at night 
unattended.  The syntax used for this new extension is POWER 
"time"."date"."program.BA".

   As an example, to get a program called TEST to execute on February 
28th, 1985 at 9 a.m., the entry in Basic would be POWER "09:00:00"."02/
28/85"."TEST.BA".

   This new option can run only one program which must be located in RAM
Bank 1 and only one Power Auto Execute can be set at any time.  The 
Power Auto Execute can be set or reset while in any RAM Bank.  If the 
target program is not found, RAM Bank 1 main menu will be displayed, 
and, if no target program is specified, Basic will be entered with RAM 
Bank 1 active.

   To illustrate the thought that Microsoft and Radio Shack gave to this
feature, you have to consider to possibility that the 200 is busy 
running another program when the Power Auto Execute occurs.  It's very 
rude of your computer to suddenly terminate a program you're using.

   Relax.  That's not the way it happens.  Should it become time for the
Power Auto Execute sequence, the 200 will begin beeping, three beeps per
second for five seconds.  If you want to see what all the fuss is about.
press the CTRL and LABEL keys and you'll see the prompt "It's time to 
run TEST.BA" displayed in reverse lettering on the last line of the LCD.
  You can cancel this message by pressing any key.  If you want to let 
the system run TEST.BA, you must exit back to the main menu and from 
there the 200 will take over.

BOTTOM LINE.  The 200 is an excellent portable computer and provides a 
lot of power for each dollar spent.  As reviewed, it does have some 
shortcomings.  All documentation I received was at the semi-final draft 
stage.

   Conversations with Stu Weinstock, buyer for the Tandy 200, brought 
prompt reassurances that the errors I found had been identified and are 
in the process of correction for the final versions of the manual.

   I'd hoped that a renumber capability would have been added, but no 
commands could be added without destroying compatibility with Model 100 
Basic programs saved on cassette.  Hopefully, someone will create a 
short machine-language utility that'll perform true program renumbering.


   The limitation of 24K RAM will seem formidable, but I can't think of 
the last time I had a single program which required more than that 
amount.  It's going to be nice for text files, because I can type up a 
blue streak, and 24K disappears almost like magic.  Now, I have the 
capability of switching to one of two more banks with a total storage 
capability of 72K.  Well, almost.  Aproximately 4906 bytes are consumed 
in each bank for system overhead.  Still, 19,670 is a lot of programming
room and three times that is 59,010 - more room anyway you look at it.

   The Text program still doesn't have page numbers, header/footers, or,
most importantly, search and replace.  Basic doesn't have nice functions
like HEX$ or renumber capability, but I can certainly live without 
those.

   The size is right.  The weight is right.  It has just the right mix 
of features and capabilities for me.  I'm willing to wager that for 
quite a number of people who are in the market for a good portable 
computer, the Tandy 200 is going to fit them like a glove.
