  The Tandy 102 has some significant areas of hardware difference from
  the Model 100.  A major one is the systems bus configuration -- a
  difference which has prevented many third-party M100 peripherals (RAM banks
  and Chipmunk, for example) from working with the T102.  This thread
  includes recent messages which indicates another change in the 102 system
  bus.  Stay tuned!

  New wine in old cask? The new 200K Tandy Portable Disk Drive 2 isn't a
  quantum leap over the old Tandy Disk Drive. It offers twice the density of
  - - and considerable compatibility with -- the first version introduced in
  October 1985. However, the new FLOPPY.CO is still 4405 bytes, and lacks all
  the capability of 3-party DOSes. And even though it operates at 19600 baud,
  it's no speed demon. Worth buying? Yes? Worth trading up? Depends on your

  Expanded memory for these laptops is always a hot topic.  And there are
  several files in Lib 13 which list vendors who cater to this need. These
  messages discuss some of the currently-available products.  And they go
  beyond, to suggest alternatives -- such as using a desktop PC for
  mass storage.  The variety of the ideas make this THD interesting reading!
  Be sure to look at some of the NODE*.THD and GOLD*.THD files in Lib 13
  for further information.

  Supera is a Model 100 enhancement pgm. It adds a great many reatures to your
  Model 100. It is compatible with just about all other software and hardware.
  It operates transparently to you and your programs. If it weren't for all
  the things it does, you wouldn't know it is there. It improves the operation
  of the Model 100 in EVERY mode, but particularly in TEXT, where editing is
  made much more powerful.

  X-TEL is a commercial program for the Model 100/102 (and 200) with
  some really neat capabilities.  It supports XMODEM transfers at machine
  language speeds -- fast!  And it does so for binary (CO & BA) files.
  Finally, the latest version provides capture of ASCII files (like Forum
  messages) directly to the Chipmunk.  But there are some things it does not
  do.  These messages discuss one of them -- and work-around ideas.
