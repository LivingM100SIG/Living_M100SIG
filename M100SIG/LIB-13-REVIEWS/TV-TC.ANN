			TV-TC
		(c)1988 Wilson Van Alst

   Anyone who ever logged video tape has dreamed of a 
typewriter that would enter timecode automatically.
   That's exactly what TV-TC, combined with one of the Tandy
notebook computers, does.

	==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==

   TV-TC runs entirely in machine language.  And thanks to 
extensive integration with the computer's existing ROM 
routines, it needs less than 280 bytes of memory.

   In operation, the program has two modes:
	1. Read: the screen displays running timecode
	2. Write: the timecode is frozen, and the screen 
displays your keystrokes as you enter scene descriptions and
/or sound-bite transcripts.

   Logging operations start in the "Read" cycle.  You will 
see the timecode advance as the tape plays.
   Whenever you find a scene you want to log, you just start
typing.  The timecode display freezes.  The indicated time, 
and whatever you type, are appended automatically to a 
document file called "TC-LOG".
   When you finish a log item, the <ENTER> key puts you back
in the 'Read' cycle, and you're ready for another scene.
   At any point in this process, you can shuttle, rewind, or
fast-forward the tape.  The accuracy of your next timecode 
reading is not affected.

   Format for the "LOG-TC" file is: 

	01:20:22 -- officer displays weapon
	01:20:40 -- c/u empty shell casings
	01:21:10 -- bullet hole in wall
	01:24:02 -- "the perpetrator achieved entry...
	01:24:26 -- ...apprehension of said suspect."

		...where the time entries reflect 
hrs:mins:secs, the '--' separator is added automatically, 
the the text is what you entered from the keyboard, and the 
cop-talk is fictional.

   Additional notes:
	o  You can run TV-TC without timecode input to the 
computer.  The log file will indicate "(No T/C)" in place of
hrs:mins:secs.
	o  Connection to the video deck is made with Tandy's
standard cassette cable ($4.95) and readily available 
adapters to match it with the T/C OUT jack.  Or, if you can 
solder, you can build a cable for less than $5.00
	o  TV-TC runs in a protected area of the computer's 
system memory.  You do not have to CLEAR space before 
running the program, and it will not conflict with other m/l
software.

	==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==

   The price of TV-TC is $XX.  [Sorry, Compuserve rules say 
price is a no-no in forum Libs.]  There are two versions -- 
one for the M100/102 computers and one for the T200.  The 
program is currently distributed on audio tape only; but if 
there is sufficient demand, I will devise a loading system 
that allows distribution on video tape.  TV-TC is sold as 
licensed software, to be installed only on computers owned 
by the buyer.  

	==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==

   If you're familiar with the M100/102/T200 laptops, you 
already know how well-suited they are for this application -
- in the field, or in a viewing room.
   If you do much tape logging, you can imagine how much 
easier and faster it is when you don't have to keep your 
"third eye" on the T/C display and you don't have to type or
scribble those numbers for every entry.
   And if your log-sheets ever get archived or passed to 
other people, TV-TC helps ensure the information is both 
accurate and legible.
   It's unfortunate that, up to now, the only M100 timecode 
reader has been a plug-in ROM chip that sells in the $350 
range (plus $50 for a custom cable).

	==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==+==

   I will support TV-TC in every way possible.  Registered 
users who want custom features will get them, if I can make 
those features fit the structure of the program.  If there 
are generalized upgrades, they will be distributed without 
charge.  And if I write other, more comprehensive timecode 
applications software, TV-TC users will get 100% trade-up 
credit for their purchase.
