          TMPC Free Sample
--------
How to get it
--------
The TMPC free sample is available through a basic program, stored in
TMPC.SMP.  It is a long program, mostly data statements, that POKEs the sample
(which is in machine language) into your machine.  Take care that:
  - You only use a model 100 to run TMPC.SMP.
  - You use a download procedure that will not cause an error in the
    many, long, data statements.
  - You allow for the 9700+ bytes that TMPC.SMP takes up.
  - You have no 'fences' (e.g. CDOS or DVI) or other programs in high memory.
    The sample needs 60134-62960 to run.  You can have the BASIC program in
    memory with these, but don't try RUNning it.
The Sample itself in final form requires 2.7k.  The sample loader
program will make a copy of the reserved memory into SAMPLE.CO; this
means that you need 5.4k to run the sample.  You may know some tricks to
run it with 2.7k; this file doesn't explain any tricks because all of them
carry the danger of coldstarts.  If TMPC.SMP runs to completion, and you
use SAMPLE.CO, no coldstarts should occur.
Detailed Instructions:
1.  Download TMPC.SMP.  You need 9800 bytes (!).
2.  With ANOTHER 9.7k available, type: LOAD"<file>" in BASIC, where <file>
    is the name of your downloaded TMPC.SMP.  BASIC will flash WAIT
    about 20 times.  Then, you can KILL <file> (the .DO version).
3.  RUN the program you loaded. Respond to its question with a "Y".  Get
    rid of CDOS, etc., first!
4.  The rest is automatic.  If a check- sum error occurs, your only
    recourse is to download TMPC.SMD again.  DON'T bypass this check, or
    your coldstart will be your own fault.
NOTE:  There may be insufficient memory to save SAMPLE.CO.  If you get an OM
error, you can remove the BASIC loader program and type:
   SAVEM"SAMPLE",60134,62810,60134

Purpose of the Sample
---------
The TMPC sample shows you the 3-month calendar and an idea of the floor-plan
interface.  That's it.  We may be dumb, but we're not crazy!  TMPC is much
more functional, smoother, and even faster than the sample.  Some of the
features NOT in the sample:  deadlines, to-dos, automatic file maintenance,
repeating items, automatic TEXT i'face, and more.  See TMPC.PRD for more info.

Using the Sample
-------
The when you enter the sample, you find yourself in a room with four corridors.
Press the arrow keys to move through them.  Two of the corridors connect to
rooms that provide fixed information, one corridor is the exit, and one leads
to the sample calendar.
   The calendar screen has a corridor that extends one space to the right.
Press the right arrow, and the stick figure moves into that space.  Then,
the arrow keys move around in the calendar.  Shift-right and -left move
by months; Control-right and -left move by years.  The ENTER key returns the
stick figure to its original position, allowing you to exit the screen to
the left or down.  (You will notice  the "current date" flash when you are
changing the date.  In TMPC, the cursor flashes whenever in the calendar
screen.)
   The only purpose of moving the "current date" is to examine the
entries for that date.  ENTRIES?  Yes, to make entries, add lines to NOTE.DO
that start with the date in DATE$ format, followed by a space, followed
by up to 63 characters of description.
For example:
01/11/86 Anniversary
01/12/86 Report Due
01/12/86 *Office party
  There are no limits on number of entries for a date; the dates need not
be in order.  Due to a quirk in the software, the first line of NOTE.DO
will always be ignored.  (TMPC allows you to use any file name and has a more
efficient way of storing dates).
   When there is an entry for a date, the calendar will display the date in
inverse video.  Further, you can inspect the entries in the screen below
the calendar, by moving the cursor to the date, pressing ENTER and down
arrow.  If there are more than one  entry per date, F1 will cycle between
them.
   If an entry begins with an asterisk (*) -- see "office party" above -- 
that entry will show up in the opening screen when DATE$ matches the
entry date.
   There really isn't much to the sample.  Try experimenting, and you'll
get a feel for the speed of assembly- languange calendars.  TMPC is in a
league by itself.

Saving the Sample
-------
The .CO file can be saved to disk using any of the popular mass-storage
devices.  To save to cassette tape, type:
CSAVEM"SAMPLE",60134,62810,60134
  To clear the himem copy, use the command:
CLEAR 0,MAXRAM
  When you want to restore the sample from tape, you must first use:
CLEAR 0,60134
  Then, use the CLOADM command.  Before using the sample as discussed above,
you must then use the SAVEM command:
SAVEM"SAMPLE",60134,62810,60134
  For other mass storage devices, consult your manual or the helpful
members of this SIG.
