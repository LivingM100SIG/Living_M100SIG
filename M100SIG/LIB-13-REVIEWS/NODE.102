Since I installed the NODE Datapac on my Tandy 102, I have received many 
questions about its operation.

The following are some of my thoughts on using the NODE Datapac model 102/200 -
256k ram exspansion unit. Some of the following has been coppied from the USER 
DOCUMENTATION (Instruction sheet) that came with the Datapac.

Phisically it mounts on the bottom of the T-102 at the rear. It actually tilts 
the computer for an easier view of the screen.

It is aprox. ten and a half inches long and about 2 inches deep and props the 
rear of the main computer up about 1 inch. It uses a 1 inch ribbon cable to 
connect to the bus bar on the rear of the T-102.

Since the Tandy model 102 software system will NOT by itself support RAM 
expansion (above the 8k offered by Tandy), an option ROM chip is provided which
contains software which provides an 'overlay' to the main menu. This NEW 
directory maintains greater then 260k of Datapac memory that allows many 
directory entries and normal TEXT operation and a modified BASIC file 
operation.
The ROM chip plugs into the spare ROM socket in the bottom of the 102.

The Datapac holds all its memory in one bank. Plus I have the Tandy 8k upgrade 
which gives me an additional 32k in the 102.

The Datapac seems to be compatable with FLOPPY CO and the TDD. The Basic half 
of Floppy Co can be stored in the Ramdisk, but I seem to have to keep the 
machine language half in upper memory of Main Ram in the 102.

DO. programs can be written and edited within the Datapac. Basic programs 
should be run in the 102. Therefore a Basic program cannot be larger than the 
available memory in the 102. Also if the Basic program is accessing a DO. 
program, the DO. program must also fit into the available main ram of the 102. 
However I usually have 20 to 25k available in my main ram while I have over 75 
files stored in the Datapac.

I keep a short program in the main ram that will copy programs into the main 
ram from the Datapac. Also, any basic program can CALL (copy) a DO. program 
into the main ram, read it, append it, then send the appended file back into 
the Datapac to replace the file existing in the Datapac ram. The same Basic 
program can then Call another file and repeat the operation.

When necessary to go into the Rambank, the function keys will read:

EXIT	NAME	PAGE	COPY	KILL
 F1	 F2	 F3	 F4	 F5

When first connected to the 102, there is a 11794 byte file existing in the 
Datapac which contains very detailed information about the Datapacs operation. 
This file can be kept or printed and if you choose, be reduced to 1 byte (it 
cannot be killed) but it can be restored by re-formatting the Datapac.

Some of the Call features usable from MAIN RAM BASIC using 'CALL 63013,n' are:
 1- Runs the Ramdisk menu in main ram.
 8- Checks if the Ramdisk is formatted and attached to the 102.
 9- Formats (flushes) the Ramdisk.
10- Finds the next visable file.
12- Resets the directory after using 10 or 18.
13- Sets the file name block.
14- Returns the amount of Ramdisk space free.
18- Finds the next visable or invisable file in the Ramdisk.
20- Edit a file.
21- Copy a file.
22- Runs a file (BA-CO-DO).
23- Loads a file from Ramdisk to main ram.
24- Saves a file from main ram to Ramdisk.
25- Renames a file in the Ramdisk.
26- Deletes a file in the Ramdisk.
27- Checks file existance and length.
28- Checks main memory file existance.
29- Make a file visable.
37- Make a file invisable.

Added benefits available in main ram and Ramdisk are 3 control key functions:

CTRL-O  Toggles between insert and overwrite modes when editing.
CTRL-J  Counts characters, words, and lines.
CTRL-L  Locates and replaces (strings)

I hope this file will help you somewhere along the line.
