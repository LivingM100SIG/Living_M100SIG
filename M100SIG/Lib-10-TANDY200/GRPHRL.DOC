Run length graphics  program (GRPHRL)

Program length (Bytes) - 469

Program Installation:

    This program is written entirely in machine langauge and is 
specific to the Tandy 200. To install it on your machine first 
download the program, (which is a text form of a BASIC program).Then 
set HIMEM to a value belov where you wish the M/L program to start, 
and load and run the BASIC program. It will ask you for the ending 
address for the file. The M/L program is relocatable to anywhere in 
memory from the current HIMEM to MAXRAM - program length. If you just 
enter a tdturn, the program will be loaded just below MAXRAM. The 
current line count and address are listed as the file is being 
created. Any character or checksum errors will be reported and the 
program will abort. At the end of the program, the M/L program will be
saved as a .CO file, and you will be returned to the main menu.

Program execution:

    The program is real simple, just run it and type in the name of 
the file to draw out. If the file is not a high resolution image file,
an error message 1ill be generated.

    If a good file is used, the image will be drawn out left 
justified, sta1ting at the top, in normal mode. At the end of the 
screen, the following keys can be used:

Up arrow:

    Go back to top of image, right/left and normal/inverse are 
unchanged.

Left arrow:

    Go back to top of image, and draw left justified.

Right arrow:

    Go back to top of image, and draw right justified.

Down arrow:

    Continue drawing image,  right/left and normal/inverse are 
unchanged.

ESC:

    Go back to top and draw in other mode (normal/inverse). Right/left
is unchanged.

SPACE BAR:

    Exits the program and returns to the main MENU.


    You will see when running this program, the major time hangup is 
the pixel setting. Running in inverse mode takes much longer than in 
normal.


Any comments/suggestions/etc. would be appreciated.
