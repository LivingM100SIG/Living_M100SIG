This Network, called SoftMail, is a full featured BBS that allows up to 30
members to "Message" each other day and night.  It features full Password
Access and Message Privacy;  while new Callers may simply enter "NEW" as the
password and be directed to an area where they may leave an inquiry, regular
Members have three tries to give their own private Password in order to Log On.
Once successfully "In", callers have the ability to Check for Messages, to
review the "Address List", to Edit and Send Messages (with automatic line
wrap), to Receive Mail, to Page and enter a "Chat Mode" with the Sysop (that's
YOU, the System Operator!) while online, and to Log-off with an accounting of
how long they were connected.  A "Help" feature is also included, which you may
write and place in RAM as "ALL01Z.DO".

The Menus within the SoftMail are easy, self-explanatory, and only require
touch-selection.  For the Sysop there are extra features;  Four function keys
allow him or her to  1) Enter "Chat Mode" at any time with the Caller, to
2) Interrupt program execution and give a "HOST OFF" message to irresponsible
"twit" callers, to  3) Provide a warning that the System will go down in two
minutes, and to  4) simply have the screen show who is Online.  SoftMail keeps
a full record of who called, the date and time, how long they were online, and
what messages they retrieved, sent, and deleted.  This record, called
"SYSDFZ.DO", can be reviewed remotely by the Sysop.  In addition, the Program
features full error trapping, and will even "kick" persistent error makers off
the system!

During Menu input, SoftMail will convert lower case to upper case so that there
will be no errors in Command or File recognition. In the event of a "sleepy"
caller who dawdles more than two minutes without doing anything, the BBS will
even hang up automatically and reset itself!

Unlike other remote BBS's, which in effect allow the Caller's keyboard to
duplicate the Host's Console, SoftMail treats external input/output as a remote
File, and the BASIC BBS Program stays in full control at all times, with the
Host's LCD Screen only showing significant Menu selections and input as the
Caller writes messages.


BUT IT'S SO SMALL!

Now, you ask, why network with a 200?

There are a number of reasons why the 200 is a PERFECT choice:

1)  Because it has no moving parts to wear out, no disks to replace; all
messages (and the hidden Log file SYSDF) are maintained in RAM, designated as
BBS Files by the suffix "Z.DO".

2)  By using the "INPUT$" command for all input, the System is able to avoid
sabotage or interruption through a hostile Control-C or "BREAK" command invoked
by a Caller.

3)  The size of the 200 makes it highly suitable for applications which need a
full BBS without wanting to have to endure the complexity and size of other
systems.

4)  Because everything is in RAM, it is instantly accessible for review by the
SYSOP.  Responses can be written from the HOST side by simply using the TEXT
program (inserting carriage returns) and labelling the messages with Titles
that the BBS can recognize.

5)  Since it is a non-mechanical system, there is no need to fear a "runaway"
computer, disk drives smoking into oblivion.  Using the IPL feature, the BBS
can even survive power outages.

6)  Power failures won't crash the system.

7)  Finally, it's just plain fun to have so much going on so simply in such a
compact little package!!


GETTING IT TOGETHER:

Get an auto answer modem and your own phone line.

Download and Save the program as "BBS.BA".

1: Using IPL, instruct your 200 to execute BBS in case of power interruption.
2: Create a "Greetings file" and save it to RAM as "ALL01Z.DO". This will greet new users s they log onto the board.
3: Create a "HELP file" and save it to RAM as "HLPDFZ.DO".  This is the message that will be listed to the caller if he or she presses "HLP" from the
Menu.  It will also be listed from within the BBS Directory ("CHK") and may be
retrieved in that manner as well.

Be sure to set up your Caller and Password Files in Lines 1000-1004, being sure
to follow the designated format, i.e., a Two-Digit Number for the Member, one
space, the Member's Name, followed by a comma, and then the 3 letter Password
pertaining to that Member.  You may also wish to adjust Gosub 80 to include
Commands which your particular Modem requires to actually disconnect the phone
upon Logoff or "Denied Access."  Furthermore, Program Line 4 is optional and
only serves to initialize a modem; you may want to delete it if you don't need
it.

Connect an auto-answer modem to the RS-232 port (Important: Set your modem for
non-verbose, "Quiet" mode, no echo,  and with auto-answer enabled).  Plug
everything in, and run the Program!  After a few seconds, you'll hear a "Beep",
the screen will clear, show the current Files, state "Awaiting at:" the set up
(or reset-up) time, give the current memory space remaining, and (once you've
had the first caller) show who was the last person online!

When someone calls (try it!!) they'll be prompted to press an Asterisk (this
gets things going--the Host screen will state "BUSY" and the four Function Key
options will be displayed).  They will then be asked for their Password and be
sent to the Main Menu.  A special memory "Peek" technique allows for a review
of BBS-related Mail.  When the caller presses "C" for Checking Mail, he or she
will be shown the Messages that are BBS Files.

The program only displays Messages (Files) with the flag of "$$$##Z.DO".  BBS
Messages always follow the format of the left three characters matching the
Caller's name or initials, and the next two characters being digits
representing the Message Number.  The Caller never sees the "Z.DO" as it is
always added discreetly by the System.

The special Log File "SYSDFZ.DO" is not displayed, but the SYSOP always knows
it's there, and can retrieve it from a remote location (and erase it to restore
memory) at any time.  If the thought  of a RAM-based log makes you nervous,
simply hook a printer up and change Line 11 to:

11 OPEN "LPT:" FOR OUTPUT AS 4:RETURN


As a key to the symbols, the SYSDF File shows  "#" who called and when;
"<" messages retrieved,  "0" erased, or  ">" sent; and  "=" Logoff with usage
time.  An  "nle" entry indicates a denied access situation, and  "time" means
the caller got disconnected by the BBS due to overdue input.  A  "?" denotes a
BBS error recorded, and a  "[" indicates that the program incurred the same
error twice and started all over.  This will probably only happen if some
"clever" caller tries to zap you with a Control-Z!!

Callers may write to anyone but can only retrieve their own messages or those
addressed to "ALL".  The SYSOP, however, can retrieve and delete anything.
Furthermore, while anyone can originate an "ALL" message, only the SYSOP can
delete one.

The EDIT features of the BBS are fun--play with them!  They will allow a
line-by-line review, adding a line, editing a portion of a line, and deleting a
line.  Once a person elects to return to the Main Menu, they are asked if they
want to "Send" the Message.  They may answer either way; if they do not "Send"
it immediately, they may go back "Down" to the "Work Desk" at a later point and
send the Message then, or they may start another Message (or just Log Off, with
the System forgetting that anything ever happened).

If and when you purchase a Disk/Video Interface, you may wish to expand the BBS
to include other Services, related Programs which could be on Disk and
"Chained" Online.  For example, my current BBS features access to any number of
Adventure Games which Callers may dial up and play.

Happy Telecomputing!!
