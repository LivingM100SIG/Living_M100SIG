BUGS.200

A file documenting known bugs in the TANDY 200 ROM.

1.  FILE SWAP BUG

The Tandy 200 will, under some circumstances, change the contents of your
files!  The problem arises when files are in a specific order in the directory.
 It has happened to BASIC and .CO files, but not TEXT files.  The bug occurs
when you SAVE to an EXISTING file.  For example, if TEST.CO exists on the menu,
and you SAVEM TEST.CO from BASIC, then TEST.CO could end up as a different
machine language file.  And another ML file could end up as TEST.CO.

This is truly confusing to try to explain properly.  Suffice it to say, to be
safe, don't do a SAVE to an existing file name.  KILL the old file first, or
save to a different file and RENAME later.

2. TELCOM Upload Problem

I used TELCOM to upload a file to CIS with a width of 60.  The Tandy 200 did
exactly that - uploaded with a width of 60.  There was no word wrap!  The
upload was full of split words, a real mess.  I tried another upload a few days
later, and it wrapped fine!  The solution is this:

TELCOM "remembers" whether you were last in the EDIT mode of BASIC (no word
wrap) or if you were in TEXT (with word wrap).  TELCOM simply uploads with or
without word wrap depending on where you last used the Tandy 200 text editor. 
I suppose there may be some occasions when it's nice to know that you can
upload without word wrap.  But don't get caught by surprise!

The flag governing word wrap is location 61964.  If PEEK(61964)=0 then NO word
wrap will occur.  If PEEK(61964)=1 then word wrap will be performed.

3.  PRINT PROGRAM FROM TEXT

At least with the 200 you can set a few print parameters now.  But the print
processor still leaves an occasional stray space at the start of a line.  To
eliminate the problem, you can't put two spaces after a period.  The Model 100
had the same problem.

4.  YEAR JUMP

Perhaps the most "popular" bug on the Model 100 was the "automated year
indexer."  The year would change from 1985 to 1986 to 1987 to.....

I'm pleased to report that my Tandy 200 has stayed on 1985 ever since I set it
several weeks ago!  Perhaps the bug has been fixed.

If you find more bugs in the Tandy 200, send me a message or EasyPlex.  I'll
update this file if(?) more are found.
