  special measures -- compared to the 100 version, where you can simply "Load"
  the DO file to create the BA loader, and then run the BA file to create the
  CO program.  Since the total size of the DO file (XMDPW5.200) and
  resulting BA loader exceeds the memory capacity of the 200, this approach
