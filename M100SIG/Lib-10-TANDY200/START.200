START.BA by Ian Ferrier (74730,3726)

This is a short (80 byte) program that will date-stamp your text files for you.
It allows you to place the following information in a file automatically:

The file name followed by the day, date and time it was created or added to.

For example, this is what it would enter as the first line of a file called
NEW.DO:

NEW.DO Sat 12/30/89 02:22:58

Run START.BA each time you want to start a new file, or add a date-stamp to an
old one.  A list of all existing files will appear on your screen.  At the
"What file?" prompt you can do one of three things.

1)	If you want to start a new file, enter the name of the file, without the

 ".DO" extension.  The file will be created and date-stamped, and you will
 be returned to the menu, where you can load it.  The date will appear as the
first line of the file.

2)	If you want to date-stamp a continuation of an old file, enter the
 name of any .DO file that appears on your display (do not type the .DO
 extension).  The date will be stamped as the last line of the file, and you
 will be returned to the menu, where you can load it.

3)	If you want to exit without choosing a file, press Enter. You will
be returned to the menu.
