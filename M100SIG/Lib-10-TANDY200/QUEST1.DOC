Many years ago, the Royal Crown  was stolen and hidden away in a Maze.
As a young Knight, you have set out on a Quest to recover the Crown!

QUEST is a Fantasy Adventure Game for characters in search of loot, glory and blood.
Once your character has been created by the T200, it can be saved for continued play.
Your character has several characteristics, including:

COMBAT: your ability to fight.
WISDOM: your ability to read scrolls and understand clues in the Maze.
AGILITY: your ability to evade combat.
LUCK: your ability to avoid nasty things.
HITS: the amount of damage you can take.
GOLD: the amount of gold you have (max is 9999).
SPELLS: the number of spell points you have (needed to cast spells.
In addition, you will need rations, torches, armor and weapons, all available in the TAVERN.

The screen is split into three areas:
a display of your current characteristics,
an overhead view of the room you are in (if you have a torch!),
and a menu display.
Play begins in the TAVERN, where you can do the following:
QUIT: return to the opening menu.
REST: recover lost hits.
GAMBLE: gamble away your hard earned gold.
TRAIN: raise the level of a characteristic.
PACK: display the contents of your pack.
BUY: purchase various items.
DEPART: enter the MAZE.

Once in the MAZE, you can move from room to room using the cursor keys,
use MAGIC, or examine your PACK.
When you encounter something, a menu will be displayed of your options.
In general, hitting <ENTER> will ignore the options list,
allowing you to continue on your way (sometimes!).

Of course, you will need to keep track of your adventures on a map.
Beware of teleporting doors, one-way doors, monsters and traps!

The QUEST program takes up 12K, and needs an additional 2K to run.
Once downloaded, you must save to CAS or Disc, and then load as a QUEST.BA.
Characters are saved in a RAM file named CHARSV.DO.

Good Luck!
