	HAZEN-WILLIAMS PIPE FLOW
This is a simple spreadsheet template 
to calculate pipe flow characteristics
 according to the Hazen-Williams 
equation. Enter a "C" value and two 
other values and a zero or blank under 
the variable to be calculated. 
Calculated values include the velocity
 as well as the desired unknown. 
Common values of "C" are 150 for
 plastic, 140 for concrete and cement-
lined iron, 100 for older rusty pipe. 
Q is the flow rate in gallons/minute, 
D is the actual internal pipe diameter 
in inches, S is the friction loss in 
feet per lineal foot of pipe, and V is 
the average velocity in feet per second
