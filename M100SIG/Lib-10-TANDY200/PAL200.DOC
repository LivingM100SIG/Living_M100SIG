        PALETT.200
        A graphics program for the T200
        -------------------------------


        PALETT.200 is a powerful, comprehensive and EASY TO USE graphics 
package which integrates the abilities and concepts of some outstanding SIG 
programs: CANVAS.BA by Seth Kaplan, and OVAL.200, LCDSAV.200, SHPDRW.200 and 
LCDPRT.200 by James Yi. 

        PALETT 200:

        -DRAWS lines, boxes, triangles, frames, circles, letters and stored 
shapes automatically anywhere on the entire screen.(CANVAS/OVAL/SHPDRW)

        -SAVES instantly and storably ALL 30720 pixel "plots" in 3840 byte .CO 
files which can be converted into 7812 byte .DO HEX files suitable for 
uploading or exchange . (LCDSAV/HXFER)

        -PRINTS out current or saved graphics in under a minute using James 
Yi's LCDPRT.200.

        Please read ALL these instructions before you use PALETT. They're not 
complicated and they are logical but PALETT is a comprehensive program and 
you'll be lost if you don't know how the various features interact. Refer to 
these instructions often.

     SETUP:
     ------
        To use the program you'll need the following files from Library 10:

        PAL200.DOC This file.
        PALETT.200 
        OVAL.200
        LCDSAV.200
        SHPDRW.200
        SHPMKR.200 Use this to create SHPTBL.CO
        LCDPRT.200 (dtd. 21Oct88)
        HXFER.200  Use with up/download of graphics files.

        Download the files and edit all the garbage. Checksum them as .DO files
using the checksums in the files' DES. SAVE a .BA version of PALETT. 
        OVAL.CO, LCDSAV.CO, SHPDRW.CO, & LCDPRT.CO will be created by their 
respective "loaders" and will run in the ALT/LCD buffer so they should not 
conflict with anything (other than displacing another ALT/LCD program).
        A shape storage file, created with SHPMKR.200, MUST be either loaded 
already or at least have had the appropriate HIMEM space cleared BEFORE running
the CTRL D, DRAW routine in PALETT. (All other routines are independent of 
shape-tables.) The *RAM* copy of any shape-table file being used MUST be named 
SHPTBL.CO when running PALETT although it can, of course, be stored elsewhere 
under any name.
        PALETT saves on-screen artwork DIRECTLY to .CO files WITHOUT using any 
HIMEM. All stored graphics files use a "[", left square bracket, as the last 
character of the file name and ONLY those files will display in the directory 
of loadable files when you run PALETT.
        Be sure and have at LEAST OVAL.CO, SHPDRW.CO and LCDSAV.CO in RAM when 
using PALETT. PALETT will manage the loading/unloading of all these files but 
will save your work and END if it needs one you forgot to load. To print your 
graphic you'll also need LCDPRT. (See below.)


     Using PALETT:
     -------------

        The only files which PALETT.200 will process are visible .CO files 
whose 6th name character is a "[", left bracket, and which have a TOP address 
of 57260. If you wish to use downloaded PALETT.200 HEX .DO graphics files then 
first "un-HEX" them using HXFER.200 (select "default address") and re-name them
as above. You can also create PALETT.200 files from other graphics formats by 
adding the following code (with LCDSAV.CO in RAM) to the end of any program 
that draws a graphic:

            1000 LOADM"LCDSAV"
            1100 F$="IMAGE[.CO' any name including "[" as the right char.
            1200 CALL63580,1,VARPTR(F$)
            1300 END

        When you run PALETT you will first come to it's main menu: ONLY files 
meeting the criteria outlined above will display. If you have enough RAM 
available to create a new file you will also see "New file" as a selection. Use
the spacebar to move the cursor. Press ENTER to display an existing file or to 
choose the "New file" routine.
        If you chose "New file" then type it's name (1-5 letters) and press 
ENTER. You will arrive at a blank screen and the "pixel locater" will flash at 
X=123, Y=63. (ESC returns to main menu.)
        Your graphic is always saved prior to any on-screen prompted routine 
and anytime by pressing CTRL K. Pressing "?" will display a help screen 
anytime. Any key press will then return you to your graphic.


     You can DRAW three ways:

        Keys W E R, S D, Z X C draw "lines" one pixel long and brush width wide
in "normal-speed" mode.
        Press SHIFT or CAPS LOCK to qwik-draw lines with an increment you set 
by pressing the +/= or -/_ keys: plus or minus 5 pixels with each press with a 
minimum of 5
        Choose one of the available shape routines.


     You can MOVE the drawing pixel to a new location three ways:

        -"Dribble" it across the screen with the drawing letter keys in the 
"background" color by first switching color with TAB.
        -"Hop" it around using the arrow keys; 10 pixels per hop: >> GRPH/ARROW
= 1 pixel per hop. <<
        -"Jump" directly to coordinates by pressing O and entering the new X,Y 
co-Ordinates in the form n/n. (INCLUDE the "/".)


        THE MOUSE: at this writing James Yi is working to integrate operation 
of a serial-port "mouse" with the 200. This should permit use of a mouse to 
both move AND draw. Pressing M when running PALETT will take you to line 340 
which will contain the mouse code when it is finalized. For the time being line
340 will simply return to the other routines.


     Calling PALETT functions:
     ------------------------

        (NOTE: keys shown with a (t) in front of the description are TOGGLES; 
just press the key again to turn the attribute on or off.)
        You can use UPPER or lower-case letters for all sequences and ANY 
character with an ASCII value from 32 to 255 when in PALETT's TEXT mode. If you
try to do something that won't work PALETT will flash "OUT OF RANGE!" and 
resume or, for FF errors etc, will save your graphic and END with the error 
message: re-run after figuring out what's wrong. I suppose it is possible to 
frustrate the error routine and if that happens simply re-run.
        ALL shape routines (Line, Box, Frame, Triangle, Hole, and Text) require
a "Y" response to the "chirping" audio reminder to save your new shape. An "N" 
keypress will restore your screen to it's condition prior to the request. 
PALETT needs a few seconds after each shape routine to store your graphic; be 
patient.

    (t) TAB - Changes pixel "color"; works on all routines. If you press TAB 
BEFORE you leave a desired design it will erase that pixel. (This is useful 
when "jumping" from a location where you DON'T want to leave a dot behind.)
        Creative use of pixel color and shapes will let you do all kinds of 
overlays and effects; black circles inside white shapes, white letters on black
designs etc. Use your imagination!

        NUMBER KEYS control the size of your "pixel brush". The number pressed 
will become the number of pixels added to each side of your drawing pixel: 
pressing 5, for example, gives you a "brush" 11 pixels wide. This routine sets 
your current location to the new value when pressed. You can combine a wide 
brush with speed-drawing and reverse pixels to "erase" large areas of the 
screen.
        When using the diagonal pixel movement keys, W R Z C, a widened brush 
will be oriented in the last direction of vertical or horizontal movement. 
Brush width will remain at the chosen thickness when using the Border, Frame, 
Line and Hole routines; the center line of the pixel brush is the coordinate 
used by the drawing routines. Triangles are one pixel wide; manually thicken 
them to taste.

        SHIFT or CAPS/LOCK - Engage the QWKDRW attribute when drawing with the 
letter keys. The - or = keys set the increment.

        -/=  Each press adds 5 (=) or deletes 5 (-) to the number of times your
pixel brush paints with each drawing letter keypress when either SHIFT or CAPS/
LOCK is depressed.

        ARROW KEYS - These will "hop" your drawing pixel around the screen in 
10 pixel hops without leaving "dots" at each move EXCEPT at the departure 
location. (Press GRPH while you use these keys and you'll hop ONE pixel.)
        You can use this routine to move around the screen "eating" stray dots!


        P - will show you where the drawing pixel is at any time by flashing 
circles at your last pixel location and displaying it's coordinates.

    (t) ? - will display a mini help screen to remind you of key functions. 
Press any key to return to your graphic.

        O - Use to jump directly to a new location. (Pixel locations use X/Y 
format from 0/0 which is the upper left corner to 239/127 at the lower right.) 
At the X prompt enter the "X" value, a slash, and the "Y" value. Press ENTER 
and the pixel locater will flash at your new loaction.

        Note: When drawing Lines, Boxes and Frames a reminder of the routine 
you're using will display on the left side of your screen and "dribbles", 
although they show your path to the other coordinate if you don't "jump" 
directly, will not be recorded. Remember that Lines and Frames will be drawn 
with your selected brush width.

        L - Press L when at one end of a desired LINE. Dribble or jump to the 
other end, press L and there's your line. You'll then HEAR a reminder to press 
Y (yes) or N (no) about keeping what you just drew.

        B - To draw a solid box locate one corner, press B, move to the 
opposite corner, press B, and behold; a box. Respond Y or N and continue.

        F - Frame is drawn the same way: locate a corner, press F, locate the 
other corner, press F, then Y or N.

        T or K - Press to draw an open (T) or closed (K) triangle. Choose the 
location for the center and press T or K. You'll be prompted for a size: enter 
digits from 1 to 127 pixels high (at Y=63); then press Y or N.

    (t) I - Reverses all pixels and switches pixel color.

        M - This will permit use of a serial mouse for moving and drawing when 
that module is finished. Code will be uploaded later for merging.

        H - This will draw curved shapes and/or fill them in. Answer the Xr/Yr?
in one of two ways: if you enter ONE number and press ENTER, you will draw a 
circle. If you enter TWO values separated by a slash you will draw a shape with
the X value defining it's horizontal radius and the Y value defining it's 
vertical radius.
        In either case you will then be asked "Fill Y/N". A "Y" response will 
draw a filled shape; any other keypress will simply draw the shape. Remember 
that the thickness of your shape will correspond to your brush width.

    (t) CTRL T - You can enter text and ANY graphics characters directly on 
your graphic at a location centered on your drawing pixel. Choose pixel color, 
verify the location, and press CTRL T. 
        You will then be prompted for an interval value. 6 is the "normal" 
value but you can specify any value from 0 to 9. This will set two routines: 
the horizontal pixel location will automatically shift right by that value (v) 
after each entry; and the increments of the arrow keys will be changed to X=v, 
Y=v+2. (Pressing GRPH will increment the arrow keys ONE pixel at a time while 
pressed.)
        This will let you quickly enter characters with a minimum of guessing 
about where they will print. Save your work by pressing CTRL T again and 
responding "Y" to the audible prompt. (You can then, of course, re-enter Text 
and add additional characters wherever you wish.)
        Only DEL and SPACEBAR are supported in the Text entry mode. DEL prints 
a CHR$(239) in "background" color at the drawing pixel.
        If you want to print a double size piece of text somewhere you can use 
PALETT's TEXT routine to create a "graphic" of text, then print it in "graphic"
size.

        NOTE: The Border and Guide routines described below can work together 
but they set their pixel colors independently. Keep toggling them until you 
achieve the desired effect.

    (t) CTRL B - This will place a solid Border around the screen as wide as 
your pixel brush. Keep in mind that graphics along the edges will be lost if 
you toggle in and out of the border.

    (t) CTRL G - This will display a reference Guide beginning at 0,10 / 10,0 
and at 10 pixel intervals to X250,Y120. When used with Border described above 
you can serrate a solid border. Guide will also eat graphics on the screen 
edges.

        CTRL D - This takes you to one of PALETT.200's most powerful features: 
the ability to enter "pre-drawn" graphics directly onto the screen via James 
Yi's SHPDRW. To use this routine you MUST first create a Shape-table .CO file 
using SHPMKR.200 (DL10). Follow James' instructions and make a record of the 
shapes, table reference numbers and it's address. These are HIMEM .CO files 
with a DIFFERENT TOP address for each file! (You can store up to 255 shapes in 
each table!)
        These shape files can be named and stored as desired but, when using 
one of them with PALETT, the file MUST be stored in RAM as SHPTBL.CO and YOU 
MUST have cleared the correct HIMEM for that shape-table file BEFORE you run 
PALETT. Although PALETT does not use HIMEM (all modules use ALT/LCD) it WILL 
try to LOADM SHPTBL.CO into HIMEM.  (PALETT will save your graphic and error 
out if it can't load SHPTBL.)
        When you created a shape-table you saved each shape by pressing "1" at 
the upper-left co-ordinate of the shape and "2" at the lower right. Visualize 
the shape as being contained within this imaginary "box". When using shapes 
from SHPTBL the upper-left corner of the shape's "box" will be placed on your 
screen at the co-ordinates of the drawing pixel when you press CTRL D.
        The prompt for your shape # will show how many shapes are in the loaded
SHPTBL file: enter the desired # and press ENTER. The shape will be drawn and 
you will be audibly prompted for approval. If OK then press "Y"; otherwise "N" 
will re-display your screen and you can try again.
        You can erase a graphic you thought you liked by pressing TAB and, with
the cursor at the SAME position as the "bad" graphic was loaded, re-run the 
drawing routine.


        CTRL K - This will SAVE your graphic to a 3840 byte .CO file for future
use and chirp to indicate its done. USE THIS OFTEN! Although PALETT's shape 
routines save your graphic after each operation, pixel drawing with the letter 
keys is NOT saved until YOU do it with CTRL K.
        [.CO files created with PALETT.200 can be stored as .CO files or 
converted to 7812 byte HEX .DO files (using HXFER.200 DL10) and exchanged or 
uploaded.

        CTRL X - This takes you directly to PALETT's main menu AFTER saving 
your graphic.

        CTRL P - This uses LCDPRT.200 (loaded in RAM) and requires an Epson 
compatable printer to operate correctly as written. You will be prompted for a 
left margin value in inches. Enter a value between 0 and 3.175: this will tell 
LCDPRT how much space to leave between any exising left margin and the left 
edge of your graphic. With careful drawing and good pre-planning you can insert
graphics in text by pre-printing the text and leaving space for artwork; then 
re-positioning the paper and running PALETT.
        The printer routine operates INDEPENDENTLY of the LCD routine so you 
can draw with PALETT right away while working out your printer settings. If 
attempts to print graphics on YOUR printer result in gibberish don't despair!. 
Try sending your printer's graphic set-up code yourself from BASIC and re-
running PALETT/LCDPRT. If that produces a recognizable picture but is not 
completely correct you may find that you must also pre-set Line feed interval 
etc. before printing; or perhaps a slightly different code is needed somewhere 
in LCDPRT. (James Yi provides outstanding support and assistance to users of 
his programs so drop him a note describing your problems.) 
        If you need to add code to PALETT to correctly set-up your printer, add
it at line 202 BETWEEN the LOADM"LCDPRT" and CALL63574,LM,16 commands. PALETT 
sets LCDPRT to send NO linefeeds to your printer. If you need linefeeds then 
change the "16" in that CALL63574,LM,16 to "272". 
       Verify edge of screen attributes (Border or Guide) BEFORE you print. 
What you see is what you print!

        Seth Kaplan wrote the original CANVAS.BA in 1985 and I've heavily 
modified it for PALETT and added MANY bells and whistles. James Yi's LCDSAV.CO 
is what makes PALETT fun and I've made extensive use of other of his programs 
and advice. Paul Globman has suggested some neat cursor routines. Any credit 
goes to them. THANK YOU!
