        ------------------------------------

     LIBSCH.200 gives users of my LIBRIS.200 disk and cassette file catalog
system the ability to search-for and list text strings contained in the
file-name/remarks sections of the LIBFYL.DO data files.  It permits "and" or
"or" searches of these records for single or multiple strings and writes the
search results to a RAM file.  If you can't remember where you saved a
particular file or subject then LIBSCH can find it!


  - SET-UP -

     Download this file (LIBSCH.DOC), the program file (LIBSCH.200) and
Wilson Van Alst's ZIPFYI.200 (all DL10).  Remove any extraneous characters
and checksum the files.  Run ZIPFYI.200 which will create ZIPFYI.CO.  Save a
copy as back-up.  Load the LIBSCH.200 code into BASIC and "Save" to
LIBSCH.BA: back-up this file also.
     Leave as much free RAM as possible when running LIBSCH.  LIBSCH needs at
least 2000 bytes of running room and, if you find a lot of "matches", your
report file can be pretty big: 40 bytes per match.

  - OPERATION -

     LIBSCH expects you to have your "LIBFYL.DO disk" loaded, your DOS "on",
and ZIPFYI.CO on the menu.  Single letter prompts accept UPPER or lower case
letters.  <ENTER> at the first menu returns to the T200 main menu and at any
other prompt starts over.
     Cursor select LIBSCH and it begins by displaying a title screen while it
loads LIBFYL.DO.  You will then be asked for the number ("#") of strings you
want to find: enter from 1 to 9.  Search time for each data set is VERY quick
so use as many as you need.
     For each string number enter the text you're looking for.  The search
routines are NOT case sensitive so you may enter "tape" and LIBSCH will find
any record which contains the string "TAPE", "Tape" and "tape" either alone
or as part of another word like "taperecorder".
     After you've entered the chosen quantity of search strings, you'll be
asked "Ok?".  If OK then press "Y" or "y": any other key will begin again.
     If you selected more than one search string then you'll be asked "Search
type: <A>nd  <O>r".  Press the highlighted single letter to choose.  (If you
chose to search for only one string then "single $" will display instead.)

         "<A>nd"
           This will find ONLY records that contain ALL your string choices:
           "tape" AND "recorder" for example.  The strings may appear in any
           order in the record.

         "<O>r"
           This will find records that contain ANY of your string choices:
           "Tape" OR "recorder"; records with more than one will be found too.

     While LIBSCH is looking for your strings, the name of the LIBRIS data
files containing your filenames and comments will display.  As ZIPFYI
examines each of these files you may hear "clicks" from time to time.  This
is normal and occurs when a "match" is found: no clicks means no matches in
THAT data file.  After all the data files have been searched, LIBSCH displays
"Working..." while it does the "and"/"or" sorting: clicks continue.  From
start to finish, LIBSCH need about 30 seconds for every 100 commented file
records.
     When LIBSCH is done, it will take you directly to MATCH.DO via TEXT. 
This ram file begins with a header line which shows your search type in
square brackets and the strings included in the search.  The matches are
listed in sets by source and are displayed as found in the data files:
file/source/size/comment.  Use any of the normal TEXT functions for finding,
listing or printing your search results: F8 returns you to the T200 Main
Menu.  (If you want MATCH.DO sorted then do it from the Main Menu with some
Sort utility: ZIPSRT.CO is the best.) 
     LIBSCH and ZIPFYI append data to MATCH.DO so results of subsequent
search requests will all be available in the same MATCH.DO.


                - ERRORS -

     LIBSCH only traps for a missing 0:LIBFYL.DO or ZIPFYI.CO: other errors
simply print error/line number and end operations.


                - Credits -

     Wilson Van Alst wrote ZIPFYI.CO which makes LIBSCH practical and gave me
permission to use it here.  He also contributed many hours of discussion
about various types of "AND/OR" search routines which helped me understand
the logic needed for LIBSCH to work.
