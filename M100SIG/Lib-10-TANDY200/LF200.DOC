DOCUMENTATION FOR LFEED.200

As we all know, the TANDY 200 suppresses line feed characters.  It does not 
allow them to go to the Printer or out the TELCOM port.  This program allows 
line feeds to go to either place.

The Line Feed patch is installed at address 61803.  This is an area normally 
reserved for the function keys.  You are allowed to define a function key with 
as many as 16 characters.  The TANDY 200 never uses more than 5 unless you 
redefine them.  The LF patch uses the remaining 11 bytes of the F8 (Menu) key. 
So, if you redefine that key, DO NOT use more than 5 characters!!!  The 
intercept vector in HIMEM is at 62739.

The TELCOM patch is from Phil Wheeler.  The flag is location 61243.  If the 
value stored there is zero, then no LF's are sent.  If it's 1, then LF's are 
sent.

USING THE PROGRAM:  Upon loading into BASIC, run the program.  It will display 
the present status of your linefeeds.  Then it will ask if you want to Install/
Disable Printer Line Feeds.  It will then do the same for TELCOM line feeds.

CAUTION:  Do NOT use this program with other programs that use Line Feed 
patches.  That's a good way to end up with cold starts!  You can scavenge parts
of this program if you only want one feature or the other.
