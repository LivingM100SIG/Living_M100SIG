QWKSIG.200 contains two programs: QWKSIG.INT (internal modem) and QWKSIG.EXT 
(external Hayes-comp. modem).  They were written and tested to permit reliable,
unattended capture of new M100SIG threads with as small a program as practical.
They are intended for FREQUENT SIG visitors.

Download this file and remove all extra CIS characters.  Checksum it and decide
which program/s you will use.  Replace the words "phone#", "user.id" and 
"pass.word" with your LOGON data.  (Note that the data is split between two 
lines of code in QWKSIG.EXT.)  If your CIS profle names PCS-154/M100SIG as your
"TOP" menu then you can change "GO M100SIG" to "T" in the logon sequence but 
the programs will work fine as written.

Using TEXT, copy the desired program code and PASTE it into BASIC.  Then
save as a .BA file and copy it somewhere for back-up.

OPERATION is VERY simple. Just cursor over the program and press <ENTER>.
QWKSIG logs on, goes to the M100SIG, downloads any "new" threads and appends
them to a RAM file named SIG.DO, logs off and returns to the main menu.
SIG.DO will contain all unread threads including CompuServe's sign-off message
with your connect time.


QWKSIG.200 makes some assumptions about the way you use the M100 SIG:

1) QWKSIG expects that you have your SIG message option set to "NEVER" pause 
between messages: this is the only way that the "RTN" command will deliver an
unprompted stream of unread messages.

2) QWKSIG assumes that you will always have enough RAM available for new
threads.  If you run QWKSIG at least once a day with a fairly empty bank then
you should not have any problems.  If you DON'T visit the SIG daily or can't 
devote sufficient RAM to capture ALL unread threads each time you visit then 
consider one of the following.

      a) Visit the SIG more frequently.
      b) Reduce the number of sections you visit automatically.
      c) Don't use QWKSIG.

Additional comments:  This program can work unattended, so the Tandy 200's
BASIC 'POWER TIME$,DATE$,QWKSIG.BA' command might be an appropriate way to
execute QWKSIG when you are not available to manually execute the program.  See
the Tandy 200 BASIC Reference Manual for details (page 49).

QWKSIG.INT was beta tested by Randy Hess, who also contributed to this project by writing the docs.
