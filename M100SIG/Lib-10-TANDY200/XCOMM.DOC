XCOMM is a simple terminal program with Ascii, Xmodem, Xmodem 1K,
 and Ymodem Batch file transfer protocols.

It is 1710 bytes and relocatable as it is loaded by the
 Basic loader.  Before running XCOMM.CO, clear HIMEM by going to Basic and
LOADM the file, and then CLEAR 255,Top  where Top is the first address you see
when it's LOADMed.

It is not fully featured, like TELCOM, in order save memory space, for those
times when you might need it.
But it has all the basic neccessary functions.
Except getting the phone connected, if using the internal modem.
You can do that by exiting to Basic while online with TELCOM and
 RUNM"XCOMM", or use the following simple Basic driver.
If using external modem, you can just run XCOMM by itself without doing
anything first.  It will connect with the modem all by itself.

11 AR=34526:'Activate RS232 port

At the "Baud?" prompt when the program is first ran, type the number
 corresponding to the baud rate:

0 = 300 baud, internal modem.

External modem:
3 = 300
4 = 600
5 = 1200
6 = 2400


Function keys:

F2 - Download.

F3 - Upload.

F4 - Toggle Full/Half duplex.

F5 - Toggle Echo to printer.

F6 - Goto Menu without disconnecting modem.  Then enter BASIC,TEXT, go back to
 XCOMM, etc.  Warning: Exit from TEXT disconnects modem.

F8 - Exit - RETurns to where it was called from.

The function keys are not visible.

It can download or upload to and from a device that you specify with the file names. (0:file, RAM:file, file, etc.)

Download or upload can be aborted by pressing ESC key.  The program will abort,
 but if the other side doesn't abort within reasonable amount of time, try
 pressing CTRL-X a few times.

Holding down SHIFT while up/downing lets you see the contents of the blocks
 being transferred.

Ymodem is usually faster than Xmodem, and Xmodem 1K sightly faster than Ymodem
 because Ymodem transfers extra two blocks containing file name, length, date.
It will display this information when downloading with Ymodem.
