String replace program (WRDRP1)

Program length (Bytes) - 549

Program Installation:

    This program is written entirely in machine langauge and is 
specific to the Tandy 200. To install it on your machine first 
download the program, (which is a text form of a BASIC program).Then 
set HIMEM to a value below where you wish the M/L program to start, 
and load and run the BASIC program. It will ask you for the ending 
addrBss for the file. The M/L program is relocatable to anywhere in 
memory from the current HIMEM to MAXRAM - program length. If you just 
enter a return, the prograb will be loaded just below MAXRAM. The 
current line count and address are listed as the file is being 
created. Any character or checksum errors will be reported and the 
program will abort. At the end of the program, the M/L program will be
saved as a .CO file, and you will be returned to the ma0n menu.

Program execution:

    This program takes a .DO file and replaces all occurences of a 
user input text string with a user input replacement string. The 
maximum length for either string is 30 characters. The minimum length 
for a search string is one character, and for a replacement string 
zero characters. In the case of zero characters, (just hitting ENTER),
all occurences of the search string will be deleted from the file.

    The total number of changes made will be listed when the program 
finishes.


Any comments/suggestions/etc. would be appreciated.
