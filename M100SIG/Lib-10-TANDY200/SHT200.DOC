the cockpit--
to the final visual approach, where the pilot relies both on the look of the 
runway and the information provided by instruments.
Instruments in this game are most important, throughout the approach.
As an instrument rated pilot,  I can say that this game accurately simulates 
the problem of getting lined up on final!
The extra problem here is that this is space shuttle simulation--
 it's a deadstick landing, without power. If you miss, you crash.
The program derives from SHTL27.100, written by Lorne Williams and others.
More documentation is availible in the associated files in the data libary 
given over to games. (i.e SHUTLDO.DO, SHUTLDO.LEW).
I have added the visual display for the model 200, including the "HSI" or 
horizontal situation indicator. This shows the aircraft's position in 
relation to the runway.
Below the top half of the screen (which shows the view outside) is the 
instrument panel.
In the center of the panel is the HSI, with the aircraft symbol in the center 
and the runway symbol in one direction or another.
Above the HSI is your compass heading. 
Below, the "Rnwy Dev" shows your lateral displacement from the extension of the

 runway centerline-- i.e.  if the figure is 0, then you are on the center line.

The indication "UR-E" means "you are east" of the runway; UR-W means west. 
Turn indications are shown on either side of the HSI, with the rate of turn 
indicated by the number, 1-4.
On the left side of the panel, your altitude, Vertical Speed Indicator, and 
Descent angle are all shown. 
To the right of the HSI is displayed DME (distance measuring equipment)-- your 

distance from the runway threshold; your speed; whether your landing gear is up
or down;
and whether your spoilers are deployed or retracted ("closed").
The arrow keys provide input for the turn rate and descent angle. The gear is 
lowered by pressing "g"; it cannot be raised. 
Spoilers are deployed with "s" and closed with "c". You will stall at a higher 
speed with the spoilers retracted.
I suggest you try the practice approach first to see how the various flight 
parameters interact.
On a practice approach you begin about a mile out, on the runway centerline, 
facing the runway threshold (south). 
Then try the full approach: that option places you high above the runway, on an
outbound leg facing north.
I suggest you fly, not directly out, but angled somewhat to the west, so that 
when you loop back east (and then south)for the final approach you don't find 
yourself to the far east of the runway centerline.
Once established on final-- defined as within 100 ft Runway Deviation and 
heading 180 degrees-- 
you'll "break out of the clouds" and the runway will appear before you.
There is a bug in the program: The HSI, in certain turns, will briefly show the

runway 180 degrees from its true relative position.
If anyone deduces the logic problem, please let me know. All other comments and
suggestions are more than welcome too.
