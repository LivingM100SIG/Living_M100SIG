after a similar program "WORLD.100". In addition to the changes which were made
for the M200, the program has used portions of the screen dump program 
"LCDSAV.200".

	The following programs are required:

	NAME	   BYTES  CHECKSUM

	WLDNAV.200 1817   127,785
	WORLD.PIC  5200   342,206
	WLDNAV.DOC 1338   

	"WLDNAV.200" displays a picture of the world (WORLD.PIC) and allows you
to select any two points on the map and displays the Latitude, Longitude and 
time for each location and the distance, in nautical miles between them. As 
writen, the program has as it start point, Edmonton, Alberta which is on 
Mountain Standard Time (Zulu -7). New locations are selected by moving the 
cursor (a dot) with the arrow keys.

	Definitions:

       <S>ave   - Saves current location of cursor    
       <D>ist   - Calculates distance (nm) between    
                  Saved position and present Location 
       <R>edraw - Redraws map                         
       <L>oc    - Defines present location of cursor  
       <M>enu   - Returns you to main menu.               

	Redefining start point:

	a. Move cursor to location of your desired
	   start point with arrow keys;
	b. Interupt program with Cntl-C (^C);
