Debug.200 documentation.
------------------------

Debug will allow ML programmers to analyse the  operation and effects of a 
Machine Language Program.
It can be used to step programs, to analyse registers, to change memory 
locations and so on...

This version has been adapted for the TANDY 200 from the original version of 
KARL CHASE [70536,253] for the model 100.
This is why it only uses half of the T200 screen as modifying the display was 
too complicated. But it works as well!


TO GET A WORKING COPY:
----------------------

The first time you run DEBUG.200 involves many steps. But then subsequent use 
will be easier.

YOU NEED : --> DOCO.200  (DL10)
--------   --> DEBUGB.200 (DL10)
	   --> DEBUG.HEX (DL10)
	   --> DEBUG.DOC (DL8)

Download all these programs. DEBUG.DOC is the original documentation.
Except for the method of setting up DEBUG and the program location, these 
instructions are the same as for DEBUG.200.

MEMORY SHOULD BE ALL CLEAR !!! that is himem should be equal to maxram (19590).


(BY THE WAY, I use DISK-POWER 200 which resides in low memory! thus allowing ml
programs to be assembled in himen)

In an ALL CLEARED memory bank :
1-load DOCO.BA
2-load DEBUG.DO   (DEBUG.HEX of DL10)
3-edit DEBUG.DO and remove all CARRIAGE RETURN symbols except for the last one.

4-return to main menu and go to BASIC
5-type CLEAR256,58624
6-return to main menu and run DOCO.BA
7-in DOCO use function (L) to convert a DO file to a CO file
8-to the DO file question answer DEBUG (no extension) and return
9-to the CO file question answer DEBUG (no extension) and return
10-DOCO will translate the DO file to a ML program (start=58624, end=61100). It
takes several minutes to translate.
11-once over, press "ESC" to go to the main menu and make sure to save the 
DEBUG.CO file just created.


These steps only have to be done the first time. Thereafter you can use 
DEBUG.CO and DEBUGB.BA directly.



TO USE DEBUG:
------------:


Refer to DEBUG.DOC in DL8 for complete documentation. The operation of DEBUG is
explained in details.

CLEAR ALL MEMORY BEFORE USING DEBUG!!!

1 - load DEBUGB.BA
2 - load DEBUG.CO
3 - run DEBUGB.BA
4 - voila, you are in DEBUG



WARNING-WARNING-WARNING-WARNING !!!


This program is not for people who do not understand ML or do not understand 
how to operate DEBUG.
Also stepping a ROM routine may take you to the no-where land ...

Leave me messages if you have any problems. I will answer as soon as possible. 
Also don't get angry, DEBUG works perfectly !!!
