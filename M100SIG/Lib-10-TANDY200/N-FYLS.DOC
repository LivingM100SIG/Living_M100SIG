     N-FYLS.CMD is a 1551 byte, easy to use, BASIC program which uses Paul
Globman's RAMDSK.CO(c) DATAPAC access program to quickly create an
alphabetically sorted index file (w/sizes) of all files currently stored in
the Node DATAPAC.  It also permits the user to Re-name and Kill DATAPAC files
and to print an alphabetized, formatted directory.  Each use automatically
updates and copies to DATAPAC a compact, current, index file called [NFYL].DO.
     N-FYLS.CMD is written for use with the XOS-C cross-bank access system but
can be easily modified to operate as a conventional "same-bank" program.

     SET-UP
     ------
     Download this file and N-FYLS.CMD. Remove all extra CIS characters,
checksum the program file and "Load" and "Save" it as N-FYLS.BA.  Make a
backup copy to the DATAPAC or Disk.
     You'll also need RAMDSK.CO in Bank 3 and Wilson Van Alst's ZIPSRT.200,
from this DL, stored in the DATAPAC.  (N-FYLS.BA will copy ZIPSRT from the
DATAPAC when needed.)
     N-FYLES is self-clearing: it removes itself and RAMDSK when done so it is
ideal for cross-bank access using XOS-C's Cmd>/F3 key.

     OPERATION
     ---------
     With RAMDSK.CO in Bank 3, select N-FYLS.BA.  N-FYLS first copys ZIPSRT.CO
 from the DATAPAC, updates [NFYL].DO, sorts [NFYL].DO and stores a copy of the
updated file to DATAPAC. A menu displays prompting Edit/Print:

         <E>dit directory
          This begins to display the DATAPAC files one by one for review,
          Renaming or Killing.  <ENTER>/Cr increments the files: <ESC> ends
          and updates again if you've renamed or killed files.  After the last
          name displays, N-FYLS will either update if any changes were made or
          re-display the first file name.
              To <R>ename a file press "r": enter a new name with or
              without extension and press <ENTER>/Cr.  You cannot rename a
              file with its same name and a simple <ENTER> aborts the command.
              To <K>ill a file press "k", confirm with "y" and press <ENTER>:
              any other key aborts the command.
         <P>rint directory
          Prints a 76 column formatted list of all DATAPAC files and sizes
          followed by the number of files and DATAPAC bytes free.

     Each use of N-FYLS leaves an [NFYL].DO copy in RAM for you.  Kill it when
finished because a copy is already in the DATAPAC.

     [NFYL].DO contains the date and time of the last update in the first line
and all subsequent lines contain file information in the format:
"filenam.ext/comma/size" for easy use with BASIC's "INPUT#n,F$,Size" statement.

     Whenever you need to use [NFYL].DO simply move it from the DATAPAC into
RAM using RAMDSK.CO or re-run N-FYLS.BA.  Regular use of N-FYLS.BA will keep 
[NFYL].DO up-to-date.

     During DATAPAC loads & saves, command information will flash briefly
on the bottom of the screen.  The first time you run N-FYLS, the directory
file [NFYL].DO will not appear in your directory but subsequent updates will
include it.

     "DATAPAC bytes free:" updates as files are killed.


     Non XOS-C use
     -------------
     Remove this code in Line 1 >>>  :CALL41179 ..(to).. END:
     Substitute this code       >>>  :LOADM"RAMDSK":
     Operation is the same but RAMDSK.CO must be on the menu.
