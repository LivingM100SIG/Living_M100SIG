10 REM DO2BA.200 by James Yi 73327,1653 06/28/88
20 REM This BASIC loader creates the actual running program
25 REM Use this utility when there isn't enough memory to LOAD a Basic program downloaded as text file.
30 REM It directly converts a Basic program saved as a text file into a tokenized .BA file.
40 REM It destroys the text file in the process, so save the original text file if you want to see it again.
60 REM If there is garbage that is not a part of the Basic program in the text file, you'll see it displayed and hear a BEEP,
65 REM and it will simply be ignored, so the conversion will still be successful.
67 REM In case you have entered the wrong file name, press <CTRL> to safely recover the file.
68 REM DO NOT use RESET button instead!
