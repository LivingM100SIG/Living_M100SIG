               -------------------
     
             EXAMIN.200 is a simple, BASIC "front-end" written to
     facilitate the use of Paul Globman's SEARCH.200 and DBG.200
     programming utilities.  EXAMIN helps the user create data strings
     necessary to put SEARCH to work and provides a "reminder" line of
     DBG functions.
             You'll need EXAMIN.BA, SEARCH.CO and DBG.CO (all from
     DL10).  Checksum each file after removing all extra CIS characters
     from the downloads. Use TEXT to copy and paste the program code
     below into BASIC and save as EXAMIN.BA.  Follow the instructions in
     SEARCH.200 and DBG.200 to create SEARCH.CO and DBG.CO.  Save
     EXAMIN.BA, SEARCH.CO and DBG.CO somewhere for future use.
     (EXAMIN.BA runs by itself: the other .BA programs are "loaders" and
     can be killed after they create their respective .CO pgms.)
             Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the way SEARCH.CO and
     DBG.CO operate BEFORE continuing with EXAMIN.  Make sure SEARCH.CO
     and DBG.CO are on the menu along with EXAMIN.BA.  Run EXAMIN.BA by
     cursor selection at the main menu: four menu choices are possible:
     
             <S>tring: 
               Searches all of memory from 0 to 65535 for locations that
     contain a TEXT string.  Enter your search string exactly as you
     want to find it: what you type is what you look for.
     
             <V>alues:
               Use this when you're looking for specific code sequences:
     e.g. 205  77  79.  You'll first be prompted for "How many?" values
     in your search "set": then you'll be prompted for each value in
     turn.
     
     
             When the search sequence begins, your search criteria and a
     brief memory allocation table will display. Matches display "in"
     followed by the decimal address at which your matches begin.
             When SEARCH is finished it will BEEP and wait for any key
     press. (You can use the "print" function-key here to print these
     addresses.)  EXAMIN's menu line will then re-display at the bottom.
             You may select DBG at this point and the match addresses
     will remain and simply scroll up as you use DBG: otherwise "T" or
     "V" will clear the screen and begin the prompts.
     
     
             <D>BG:
                This simply prints a "reminder" line of DBG's nine
     command letters and runs DBG.  See DBG's documentation for all that
     it can do!  The reminder line will remain during all DBG
     operations.
     
             <ENTER>/CR:
                Press <ENTER> to return to the main menu.  EXAMIN loads
     itself into the IPL buffer so that, upon leaving DBG, EXAMIN will
     re-run.  Using <ENTER> at EXAMIN's menu clears the IPL buffer and
     returns to the main menu.
     
     
             You may use CTRL/C to break out of EXAMIN if you make a
     mistake during data entry (e.g. 205 "values") but if either SEARCH
     or DBG are running then it's best to wait until they're done before
     breaking away.  For instance: inadvertently starting a search for a
     space or a "32" could take 1-2 minutes to display all the
     locations: just be patient and more careful next time.  (To exit
     DBG type "b" at a DBG ">" prompt.)
     
     
                                 --------Credits------
             Paul Globman wrote SEARCH.CO and DBG.CO which do all the
     work.  Paul also did Beta testing of EXAMIN and suggested many of
     the routines.  Wilson Van Alst's ZAPTAB and ZIPFMT were used to
     pre-format this file for upload.
