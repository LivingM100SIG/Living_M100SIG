Text file listing program (WRDLST)

Program length (Bytes) - 280

Program Installation:

    This program is written entirely in machine langauge and is 
specific to the Tandy 200. To install it on your machine first 
download the program, (which is a text form of a BASIC program).Then 
set HIMEM to a value below where you wish the M/L program to start, 
and load and run the BASIC program. It will ask you for the ending 
address for the file. The M/L program is relocatable to anywhere in 
memory from the current HIMEM to MAXRAM - program length. If you just 
enter a return, the program will be loaded just below MAXRAM. The 
current line count and address are listed as the file is being 
created. Any character or checksum errors will be reported and the 
program will abort. At the end of the program, the M/L program will be
saved as a .CO file, and you will be returned to the main menu.

Program execution:

     This program lists out a .DO file to the screen. Why you may ask,
when you have an editor?. It is a little easier for doing a quick scan
or browsing than hitting the down arrow all the time in TEXT. Just 
give it the file name, and it takes off. At the end of each line (CR),
a keyboard scan is made, and the following actions taken depending on 
the key pressed:

ESC: Aborts the listing and returns to the menu.

Up Arrow: Slows down listing speed, can be hit more than once, each 
hit goes a little slower.

Down Arrow: Resets to maximum scrolling speed.

Any other key: Pauses list, waits until the space bar has been hit to 
continue.



Any comments/suggestions/etc. would be appreciated.
