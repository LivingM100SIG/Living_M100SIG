     XBSMGR.200 
     -----------

     XBSMGR.200 is a full-featured, cursor driven, file management utility 
designed to facilitate inter-bank file transfer within BASIC using Paul 
Globman's remarkable XBASIC.CO program. It also incorporates Mo Budlong's 
TXTJMP.200 code so .DO files can be edited via TEXT directly from BASIC. You 
never have to return to the T200's main menu!
     XBSMGR.200 will:
      - Transfer .DO files FROM and TO your "home" bank. (This permits 
considerable flexibilty in planning TELCOM sessions since you'll now be able to
upload from, or download to, ALL your RAM banks in one session.)
      - Kill ANY type file in the home bank.
      - Permit you to read and/or edit any .DO file in the home bank via the 
T200's built-in TEXT editor. You can also edit .DO files from "away" banks 
simply by first moving them to the home bank with XBSMGR; then moving them 
"back" using a different name.
-
-
     Although originally conceived as an adjunct to on-line TELCOM use of 
XBASIC.CO's file transfer abilities, it may find other "off-line" uses as well.
Since it runs entirely from BASIC and does not require returning to the T200 
main menu, it's use will not "hang-up" the internal modem, thus permitting 
XBASIC and TEXT use while on-line: two  elusive capabilities previously 
available only with somewhat complicated M/L code.
     To use XBSMGR.200, download this file (XBSMGR.DOC) and XBSMGR.200. "Clean 
up" the .DO file and checksum it. LOAD it and save the .BA version. Also 
download XBASIC.200 (DL10) which you'll use to create XBASIC.CO.
     PLEASE read ALL these instructions. They're NOT complicated but proper use
of all XBSMGR.200 features requires a good understanding of exactly what's 
available. XBSMGR and XBASIC expect you to have THREE memory banks in your 200.
Also; BE SURE TO HAVE XBASIC.CO IN THE BANK FROM WHICH YOU'LL RUN XBSMGR! (I 
always keep a copy in each bank as an invisible file because of it's 
usefullness.)
     If you have TS-DOS' "Cleuseau" installed, you MUST first deactivate it 
before using F3 "TEXT" or cursor selecting a .DO file. Either follow the 
instructions in Cleuseau's manual or use CALL921,146.

     OPERATION
     ---------
-
     First of all, XBSMGR.200 is a "friendly" program. The only "hooks" 
required would be those needed for ON-LINE TELCOM operation. These would be 
whatever are necessary to take you directly from TELCOM to BASIC. (Phil 
Wheeler's popular XMDPWx programs incoporate this option already; follow his 
instructions.)
    You can re-program TELCOM's F6 key to jump directly to BASIC with these two
pokes: POKE62783,143: POKE62784,131    TELCOM's F6 key would then take you 
directly to BASIC when pushed. (Be sure to read "F7  TERM" and "F8  EXIT" below
for returning to TELCOM!) 
    From BASIC you simply RUN"XBSMGR" to arrive at it's menu, which is similar 
in layout to the normal menu. All three banks of files will display with the 
bank number to the left of the first file in each bank. Your HOME bank is 
listed first. If you have more than 56 files then a "+" will display in front 
of the last file displayed and the excess will not display. 
    Bytes free in the HOME bank and .DO file sizes in ANY bank will display in 
the customary places. Move the cursor with arrow keys or Spacebar. (If an arrow
key should not happen to move the cursor, try the spacebar or a different arrow
key.) Time displays in the lower left corner.
-
    XBSMGR's menu works very much like the 200's main menu except that:
      - ALL the files in All the banks will display; "invisible" or visible, 
and are accessible within the parameters of the different routines.
      - If you press ENTER while the cursor is over a file in an "away" bank, 
you'll hear a BEEP and XBSMGR will re-run. Otherwise pressing ENTER while the 
cursor is over a file in your "home" bank works just like the 200 menu: 
selecting a .DO file takes you to it via TEXT, a .BA file will execute and a 
.CO file will run if HIMEM is correct.
     (Be careful with prgms that return to the main menu if you're on-line with
the internal modem, or of .CO programs that might load into previously reserved
HIMEM if you're expecting something else to be there when you leave XBSMGR.)
-
-
     FUNCTION KEYS
     -------------
-
      - F3  TEXT
     This will prompt you for a file name and take you to the 200's TEXT editor
in the file name you select. (Or you can simply cursor to an existing file and 
press ENTER.) All the TEXT function keys and device routines will work normally
but remember: F8, Menu in the "LIST" routine (TEXT F4) will return you to the *
T200 menu* losing your carrier, (use "Edit" to return to the file instead); and
any routine that uses the comm. chip (like SAVE 0:) will also hang up the 
internal modem. TEXT F8 returns you to XBSMGR.
-
      - F4  Copy (.DO files only)
     If you press it while cursored over a home bank file, you'll be prompted 
for a "Destination bank:". The file will then be REMOVED from the home bank and
moved to the chosen bank: either to a new file if the source filename doesn't 
exist in the destination bank, or APPENDED to a same-named file. If you press 
F4 with the cursor in one of your "away" banks, the file will COPY to the home 
bank automatically, opening a new file if one of that name doesn't exist in the
home bank, or appending the transfer to a file with the same name. In either 
event, the original will REMAIN in the away bank. 
    While the file transfer is taking place, "Working..." will display at the 
bottom of your screen. If you try to write too much data to a bank you will 
hear a BEEP and an error message will display: the transfer did NOT complete, 
although you've filled the bank with a PORTION of the source file. If you have 
the space in the home bank, you can rename your source file and transfer the 
partial, "failed" file back to your home bank, see how much made it and then 
edit your source file before moving the "rest" of it to another bank. Or simply
choose another bank and transfer the whole file again. 
     When finished, the "new" menu entries will display.
-
      - F5  Kill
     This will Kill ANY file in the home bank except XBASIC and XBSMGR. Any 
response to the prompt other than "Y" or "y" will re-run. (If you kill a BASIC 
file you will have to re-run XBSMGR.)
-
      - F6  Name
     Lets you re-name any file in your current bank. Enter six characters; the 
ENTER and Spacebar keys make spaces. 
-
      - F7  TERM
     This will take you directly to the TERM mode of TELCOM. Change this to 
CALL24573 if you prefer to return to TELCOM OR you can substitute code needed 
for your particular application. (LINE215)
     (If you are using XBSMGR in conjunction with one of Phil Wheeler's XMDPWx 
programs you may want to substitute the appropriate CALLHIMEM+xx code here. If 
HIMEM is correct you could also re-enter the program by simply selecting it 
with ENTER from XBSMGR's menu.)
-
      - F8  EXIT
     XBSMGR.200, as uploaded, simply "END"s the program leaving you in BASIC. 
You can change the code to whatever you prefer. (LINE100)
-
-
      - ERRORS
-
    Errors happen. XBSMGR handles errors in two ways. If it encounters a BASIC 
error, like OM? or FF? it will BEEP-BEEP, print the error # and line # in the 
lower left corner of the screen and wait for any key-press before re-running. 
MOST other errors; incorrect bank number, incorrect key-press and incorrect 
file-type requests will BEEP and re-run the program.

     I am indebted to Paul Globman for his patient help in showing me (over and
over) how to use the access codes for XBASIC.CO. XBSMGR only scratches the 
surface of XBASIC's capabilities but will hopefully encourage other 
applications. Please direct praise and comments about XBASIC.CO to him but ANY 
problems with XBSMGR.200 should, of course, come to me. I hope you find the 
program useful.
