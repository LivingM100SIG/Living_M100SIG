      BBS Text-Uploading Program
     by Andrew Zarchy [73107,3455]

	SENDER.200 formats and uploads text files from the Model 200 to local 
BBS's that use line prompts or otherwise receive too slowly for TELCOM.  It 
automaticaly matches TELCOM's current parameters, and allows variable send 
rates or fussy BBS's.  However, it can ONLY be used with an external, Hayes-
type modem, as it requires disconnection from TELCOM to be run.

	Because SENDER has no error-checking, is not a dialer, and because it 
works in conjunction with TELCOM instead of replacing it, it is much smaller 
than programs like XMODEM.

	Directions:

   1. Log onto the BBS in your usual way.

   2. When the BBS is ready to receive your text file, disconnect from TELCOM 
by pressing F8 and answering "Y" to the prompt.  You'll return to the Main 
Menu.  The external modem will maintain the signal carrier.

   3. Select and run SENDER.BA.

   4. Answer SENDER's prompts, pressing ENTER after each:

   "File to Send?": type the file you wish to send (a ".DO" file only).  Type 
file name only; do not type the extension ".DO"

   "Width (79) ?": type the line width you wish to send.  This is the maximum 
number of characters per line the BBS displays.  If the BBS uses automatic word
-wrap, type the number of the column before word-wrap occurs.  (See WORD-WRAP 
in Notes below.)  Pressing ENTER here defaults to 79, the most common setting. 
(Second most common is 39.)

   "Char. delay 0-10 ?"  This is how long SENDER will wait between characters. 
Be optimistic - try pressing ENTER (for 0).  Some slower BBS programs may 
require a higher setting.  (See CHARACTER DELAY in Notes below.)

   "Prompt?": If the BBS uses line prompts, type the line-prompt character (one
character only).  Example: If the BBS sends "1>" to start the first line, then 
enter the ">" character (without quotes).  If the BBS gives you a choice of 
using or not using a prompt character, always use one.

	If the BBS uses word-wrap or otherwise doesn't send line-prompt 
characters, press ENTER at "Prompt?" and answer "Line delay 0-10 ?"  (See LINE 
DELAY in Notes below.)

   5. The message "Sending file" will appear, followed by "Line:" and the line 
numbers of your file as they are formatted and uploaded.  When it's finished 
transmitting your file, SENDER will chime and return you directly to TELCOM 
Terminal Mode.

   6. When you see a flashing cursor, you're back in TELCOM.  Type the 
abbreviation the BBS uses to indicate you've finished sending text.  (You may 
have to press ENTER first to begin a new line.)  Then list your file on the BBS
to check it, editing if necessary.


NOTES:

	BBS programs (and the computers they run on) vary in the speed at which
they can accept data.  Some are quite fast, and some go no faster than a fast 
typist.  The only sure way to figure out the speed at which a BBS will accept 
data is to experiment.  Send test files, raising or lowering SENDER's delay 
rates until you find reliable settings.  Most BBS sysops will be happy to help 
you and allow you to send test files.  After all, when you begin uploading 
posts instead of typing them online, you'll be shortening your session time.

	CHARACTER DELAY: Most BBS's I call can receive characters as fast as 
SENDER can send them, so I usually press ENTER (for 0) at this prompt.  If the 
BBS is missing characters in the middle of your lines, try raising this 
setting.

	LINE DELAY: If the BBS's text editor doesn't send prompts characters (
ie., uses word-wrap), you must tell SENDER how long to wait between lines.  
Experiment.  Try the 3 setting.  If the beginnings of your text lines are 
chopped off when you list them, first be sure you're not sending lines that are
too wide.  (See WORD WRAP.)  Then increase the Line Delay.

	INTERRUPTING: You can stop SENDER and return to TELCOM at any time.  
Just press SHIFT/BREAK, return to the Main Menu (F8), select TELCOM, and re-
enter Terminal Mode (F4).

	WORD-WRAP: Many BBS's use word-wrap to format text automatically as it 
is sent manually.  SENDER bypasses word-wrap by sending a carriage return 
before the column where word-wrap occurs.  If you're not sure where the BBS's 
word-wrap occurs: enter a line of text with at least one space in it, count the
number of characters till the new line begins, and set Width short of that.

	If your text appears DOUBLE-SPACED on the BBS, you are sending lines 
that are too wide and are activating the word-wrap, causing extra carriage 
returns.  Use a shorter Width.

	It's rare, but some BBS's with word-wrap will not accept forced 
carriage returns (which means your post will be one big paragraph).  In this 
case, enter 0 Line Delay and use a higher Character Delay, since Character 
Delay will act as the Line Delay at the point of word-wrap.  Experiment and see
what works.

	FILE LENGTH: Be sure to observe the BBS's maximum post length (number 
of lines per post).  If you try to send more than the allowed number of lines, 
all kinds of havoc can break loose as text characters overflow the text editor 
and answer BBS prompts.

	If you're not sure how many lines your file will be, keep your eye on 
SENDER as it runs, and INTERRUPT it before it exceeds the maximum number of 
lines.  Then return to TELCOM, edit the unfinished line of your post, and send 
the rest of your file in a separate post.  (Remember: the external modem 
maintains your carrier, so you can freely hop between TELCOM, SENDER, .DO files
and menus while on-line... even keep a copy of SENDER on each menu!)

	USER HOSTILITY: In the interest of compactness, SENDER has no exotic 
error-trapping routines.  For example, it assumes you won't select a file that 
doesn't exist.  If you do, the program will simply stop.  If this happens, run 
it again.  (If only relationships were so easy.)

	TAB CHARACTERS: SENDER interprets tab characters (chr$(6)) as eight 
spaces.  To change the number of spaces a tab character represents, change the 
value of "T" at the beginning of line 54:

     54 T=8:A=A+SPACE$(T):X=X+T-1:
        NEXT:GOTO60

   Example: T=5 will cause SENDER to treat tabs as five spaces.

	MODIFYING SENDER.200 FOR MODEL 100:  As far as I know, SENDER will work
on Model 100 with these changes:

   1. The PEEK in Line 20 (61244) must be changed to the beginning address 
where Model 100 stores TELCOM parameters (whatever it is)

   2. The CALL in Line 95 must be changed to Model 100's jump-to-TELCOM CALL (
whatever it may be)

   DIALING: I keep a separate dialer program on my menu, a modified version of 
Tony Anderson's dialer on this SIG.  (It lists BBS numbers in the ADRS.DO file 
in rotating menus, and auto-dials and logs onto them at the press of a number 
key.)  I like having the two functions separate, for menu management.  It 
wouldn't be hard to combine them, though. If anyone's interested, let me know.
