     I am discovering that the Tandy 200
Manuals leave something to be desired!  
Here is an undocumented variation on the
BASIC "POWER" command:
     POWER "hh:mm:ss",,BASIC program 
will cause the Tandy 200 to repeatedly 
run the specified BASIC program each day
at the specified time.
     The manual says nothing about 
leaving out the date.  The normal syntax
is POWER "hh:mm:ss","mm/dd/yy",BASIC 
program.  The normal syntax causes the 
computer to turn on once and only once 
on a particular date at a particular 
time.  By leaving out the date, the 
computer will turn on every day at a the
specified time.
EXAMPLE: POWER "12:00:00",,"LUNCH.BA"
     The above example would cause the 
Tandy 200 to run the program called 
"LUNCH.BA" every day at 12 noon.
     And now I have a question:  Has any
one figured out how to read the BIT 
mapped graphics from each pixel off the 
screen.  A Graphic Screen dump routine 
is begging to be written.
