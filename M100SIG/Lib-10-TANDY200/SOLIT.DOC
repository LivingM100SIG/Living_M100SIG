    SOLITAIRE

Solitaire for the TRS-80 Model 3
originally appeared in Softside Magazine
May 82 issue by author Larry Williams.
I adapted/converted it to run on the
TANDY 200 portable computer.
The Solitaire version (Klondike) uses
one deck of cards.  Seven piles of cards
are arranged on the table.  Three cards
at a time are dealt from the hand and
the top card can be either played on
the table or on the foundations.  When
the deck is exhausted, you are allowed 
to play the last card if necessary and
the deck is flipped over for another
round.
COMMANDS: (left arrow) move cursor left
(right arrow) move cursor right
(up arrow) or P  pick up card
(dn arrow) or D  drop card
= or N   deal next 3 cards
F        put card on foundation
(space bar)  clear error messages

Place cursor under pile you want to play
on.  Expample: ACE on pile 2  put cursor
under pile 2 and press F ..Ace will go
onto its foundation.
