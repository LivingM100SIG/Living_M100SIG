LIBRIS:  A Disk and Cassette file record system for the T200 and TDD1
=====================================================================

	LIBRIS.BA is a disk-based, full-featured, automatic, easy to use file 
reference system which will store, update and cross-reference the names, dates,
file sizes and free bytes of your Disk and Tape files. It also lets you add 
remarks to file records and automatically transfers those remarks to each 
subsequent update of that source.
	You can catalog up to 100 sources and the number of files it will 
catalog is limited only by available disk space: 92000 bytes will store about 
4000 uncommented file records in 35 data files of 2700 bytes each.
	LIBRIS also permits you to search all your file records for any 
character string enabling you to quickly find a file or remark.

	LIBPRT.BA works independently of LIBRIS but uses the same data files 
and will create "fancy" directories and labels for your tapes and disks. It is 
VERY easy to use and prints a variety of formatted file documents in 80/96/132 
column format. Follow the brief instructions in the file description and Line 0
of the program.


        You will find LIBRIS to be faster and more comprehensive than 
BIBLIO.100 or BIBPWR.100. Model 100 users of those programs can use BIBCNV.200 
(DL10) to convert the BIBFYL.DO created by those programs to LIBRIS format for 
T200 use.

	LIBRIS requires a DOS (Disk Operating System) that recognizes "0:" 
commands. POWR-DISK (DL10) is a fine example. (Disk-based TS-DOS users should 
only load the "resident" portion: press F5 at the TS-DOS menu.)

	PLEASE read all these instructions completely before running LIBRIS. 
They're not complicated but they ARE necessary.


		INITIAL SET-UP

	Download LIBRIS.200, LIBRIS.DOC, & LIBPRT.200 from DL10. Edit out the 
garbage and checksum them as .DO files. Print out a copy of LIBDOC for future 
use. Save a back-up copy of the .DO files to your disk, "Load" the .DO files 
and Save all of them as .BA's.

        Before you run LIBRIS the first time, go to TEXT and create a file 
named LIBFYL.DO: this will be the source-data file. Type a "#" as the only 
character in this file and press <ENTER>. Save this 3 byte file to your "LIBFYL
Storage Disk" (the disk where you'll keep LIBFYL and the LIBRIS data files) by 
pressing F3: type "0:LIBFYL" and press <ENTER>. Kill the RAM copy. (You'll be 
prompted when to load this disk while using LIBRIS.)
	The "LIBFYL" disk should have about 90,000 bytes free before using 
LIBRIS for the first time. Ideally it should be a disk which only has 
LIBRIS.BA, LIBPRT.BA, SORTH1.CO (for LIBPRT ops) and LIBRIS data files on it. 
DO NOT STORE ANY FILE ON THIS DISK THAT HAS A NUMBER AS THE 5th NAME CHARACTER 
other than LIBRIS's data files which use the format LIB#nn.DO!
	LIBRIS.BA is 6895 bytes and needs another 3500 bytes for operating 
room: about 10400 bytes total. You should really have only LIBRIS.BA, and DOS 
in RAM when updating files.



		HOW TO USE LIBRIS

	Always begin an update session with your DOS and the drive "on" and 
your "LIBFYL Storage Disk" loaded. (Whenever LIBRIS needs the "0:LIBFYL.DO 
storage disk" loaded during operations it will remind you to load it.) Use 
EITHER upper or lower case letters. <ENTER> or <ESC> will return you to the 
previous menu from any prompt.

	Cursor select LIBRIS.BA from the T200 main menu. LIBRIS first confirms 
that you have your LIBFYL.DO storage disk loaded by checking for a correctly 
formatted 0:LIBFYL.DO. If found it then reads 0:LIBFYL and checks that all the 
necessary data files are available. (If any are missing, LIBRIS will END and 
display the name: see "The LIBRIS data files" below.)

	Your screen will display the first 50 logged sources and two lines of 
prompts at the bottom of the srcreen. (No sources, of course, if this is your 
initial session.)

	UP-ARROW will page your source display if you have more than 50.

	<TAB> lets you "Preview" any loaded disk's files & sizes WITHOUT 
logging it.

	<SHIFT/DEL> takes you to the search routine which searchs ALL the data 
files for occurences of a data string.

	<ESC> ends the session and saves your work to disk before returning to 
the T200 Main Menu.


		ADDING NEW SOURCES

	To ADD a source type a NEW Source ID (1-6 characters) and press <ENTER>
. LIBRIS permits you to use UPPER and lower case titles for your sources. For 
example: you can use duplicate names with different UPPER/lower case 
combinations for same content disks and tapes.  LIBRIS decides whether you want
to add a NEW source or update an exisiting source based on an EXACT match of 
the name you enter and, if new, prompts you to choose <D>isk or <C>assette.
	If you decide NOT to log your entry for some reason press <ESC> at the 
<D>isk/<C>assette prompt to return to LIBRIS' main menu.

	If you press <D> you will be prompted to load the disk: do so and press
<ENTER>.
	If you press <C> you'll be asked the size of the cassette, then whether
you prefer to manually enter each file's counter reading or let LIBRIS 
automatically log the program's starting time in mm:ss from the beginning of 
the tape.

	The files on the source will display as they are read. When LIBRIS has 
read all a disk's file names or when YOU end the tape routine it will ask 
whether you wish to add <R>emarks to the file records. You can do so here or 
after the disk is logged. <ENTER> will log the records.
		If you choose <R> you will see your first file record displayed
above the Remark Editor's prompts: follow the instructions; <ESC> ends the edit
routine and logs the files.

	Since it is possible (and often desirable) to save two or more copies 
of the same program using the same name to an individual tape, ALL records will
be stored. Any comments you add to file records of duplicated files should be 
made only to the first record: comments added to a second occurence of the file
will be replaced by comments added to the first record and comments added ONLY 
to the second record will be added to both.
	All cassette files will have a "c" substituted for the final file 
extension character in the LIBRIS data files for ease of reference. The 
filename on the tape is not changed.


		PREVIOUSLY LOGGED SOURCES

	At LIBRIS' opening menu type in a source name EXACTLY as it is 
displayed: UPPER/lower case etc. A new screen will display showing Source Name,
Type (c-cass, d-disk), Date last updated, Free bytes (disk) or min/high counter
(cass), and number of files. (If you had intended to review an existing 
source's files and miss-typed the name you will arrive at the "ADD...NEW" 
prompt instead. Press <ESC> for the main menu and re-enter the name.)

	<ESC> returns you to the previous menu.

	<U>pdate prompts you to load the disk/tape to be updated. Previously 
added remarks will be automatically saved to same-named files on the "update" 
source and a "<" will display next to the file name if remarks exist. When 
finished reading the source, LIBRIS asks the same <R>emark or <ENTER> question 
as when adding a NEW source.

	<D>elete first asks you to confirm your intent before removing ALL 
records of the source, INCLUDING REMARKS, from the data files. Use carefully!

	<R>ename permits you to change the name of a source and its file 
records.

	<P>rint...  Lprints all the file records of the source including 
remarks

	<E>dit...  lets you add or delete remarks to each file record. After 
the source's file records display use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to scroll through 
the file records. If you wish to add a remark just type, use <BKSP> if needed, 
and press <ENTER>. To change an exisiting remark use <BKSP>, re-type and <ENTER
>. A "<" signifying a "remarked" file record will display next to the filename 
in the display field on the upper portion of the screen and next to the file 
name on the "edit" line. Press <ESC> when finished.




		The LIBRIS Data Files
		---------------------

	NOTE: IT IS CRUCIAL TO SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF LIBRIS THAT THESE FILES 
NOT BE EDITED OR SORTED IN ANY WAY!!


	LIBRIS stores your file records in two types of files:

		LIBFYL.DO begins with a "#" and contains the Source Name, 
Source Type, Update Date, Free source space (Disk=bytes free; Cass=time 
remaining or the ending counter reading); a graphic symbol used in keeping 
track of number of files and "LIB"; the LIB#nn "data" file which contains the 
source's file information.

		LIB#nn.DO files are created using a numerical value based on 
the checksum of the source name: often called "hashing". Up to 35 different 
data files are possible: from LIB#01 to LIB#35. This method was chosen for two 
reasons: 1) the size of the individual data files are kept small relative to 
the overall volume of information therby reducing access time; 2) the amount of
RAM needed to process the individual files is reduced permitting a more 
comprehensive program: 92000/35 LIB#nn = 2629 bytes per file (100 sources x 40 
files per source).

	LIBRIS expects to find these files on the "0:LIBFYL storage disk" 
during each operation and WILL NOT RUN if the files aren't there. If a file 
should begin to approach the size of your free RAM you'll be prevented from 
using any new source name which would be added to that file.


		-MODIFICATIONS-

	You can change the number of Sources LIBRIS will catalog (100 is 
default) or the number file-records per source if you have cassettes which 
contain more than 50 files (50 is default).
	Increasing the number of sources runs the risk of exceeding available 
disk and RAM space if these sources are all "full" of files but, if not, you 
may change the value of "XM" in line 2. You must also increase the "CLEAR" 
value in the same line by 250 bytes for every 10 sources added to XM: e.g. if 
100 is changed to 150 then CLEAR3500 must be changed to CLEAR4750.
	The TDD1 will only hold 40 files per disk but if you need to increase 
the number of files per cassette then the value of "XF" can be increased from 
it's default value of 50. Screen displays are sized for 75 max tho so I 
wouldn't suggest anything over that value. The CLEAR statement must also be 
increased by 400 bytes for every additional 10 added to XF.

	Before LIBRIS takes you to the T200 main menu it re-sets your MDM stats
to M7E1ENN. If you prefer a different setting then you can change the DATA 
statements in line 178. (These values are the ASCII values of the individual 
letters in the TELCOM "STAT" string: 77=M etc.)


		-ERRORS-

	Simple error trapping was used to save space. Be sure that your DOS and
disk drive are on and ready to go. Most errors are "LIBFYL" related and 
trapped. Any error that LIBRIS can't deal with will clear the screen, display 
the error # and line and end the program. Refer to the table below. If the 
solution isn't apparent, drop me a note.

	You may encounter the following error messages:

		"LIB#nn.DO not found": one of the data files has been lost OR 
the source name has somehow been changed in LIBFYL. You'll have to compare the 
LIB###'s in LIBFYL.DO against the files on your storage disk to see which is/
are missing. Then delete ALL sources with that file number from LIBFYL using 
the TEXT editor after downloading LIBFYL to RAM. SAVE the edited LIBFYL back to
DISK and try again.

		"NO xxxxxx FILES!": although the source name matches a data 
file, there are no file records for that source found and LIBRIS can't 
continue. Remove ONLY the offending source information from LIBFYL: SAVE the 
edited LIBFYL to disk and re-run.

		"DATA FILE FULL!" - The data file which would normally store 
these records is full; pick another Source name.

		ERROR 17 - this tells you the checksum of the disk or cassette 
read routines' data is wrong: re-run the program; if you still have the error 
then the program has been corrupted. Try another copy.

		ERROR 7 -  one of the data files has too much data in it for 
the RAM available. You'll have to clear more RAM before re-running the program.
If that's not possible then you must CAREFULLY remove all the records of a 
source from the oversize data file by following these instructions EXACTLY:
			1) Re-run LIBRIS. If you make it to the main menu use <
TAB> to check file sizes. (If you're missing a file then see "LIB### not found"
above.)
			2) Return to the T200 main menu and load the oversize 
file into RAM by opening a new .DO file with the same name as the oversize file
and using F2 within TEXT.
			3) Pick one of the source-sets of file records and 
delete all files from that source. SAVE this file back to the storage disk 
USING THE SAME TITLE.
			4) Load LIBFYL.DO into RAM and delete the SAME source's
information. SAVE this file to disk and re-run LIBRIS.
			5) If LIBRIS runs then use <SHFT/DEL> to search for any
other "stray" records of the deleted source before continuing.
