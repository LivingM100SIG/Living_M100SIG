Every now and then someone buys a used 200 and doesn't get the manual. One
of the first questions asked is how to set the TELCOM stats so that it can
be used to communicate and download. Because it is an oft-asked question,
we have archived the typical response in this file.

    A friend of mine just bought a used Model 200 and doesn't have the manual
for the telecommunications function.  Does anyone know where she can get one? 
Above all, could someone just leave me a message explaining the order of
communication parameters and what the letters mean so that I can help her set
the parameters? I will be most grateful for this information.
   thanks.  jeremy shapiro

You can order a complete set of manuals for the 200 from Tandy's National
Parts Center, (800) 442-2425

On the 200, the telcom parameters, or "status", can be set by pressing the F3
button at the opening TELCOM menu.  The first group of 7 characters are as
follows:

First character:
        M = 300 baud modem
        A number = the RS-232 port:
                1 = 75 baud
                2 = 110
                3 = 300
                4 = 600
                5 = 1200
                6 = 2400
                7 = 4800
                8 = 9600
                9 = 19200

Second character:
        Character length;
                7 (7-bit)
                8 (8-bit)

Third Character:
        Parity:
                E = Even
                O = Odd
                N = None
                I = Ignore

Fourth Character:
        Stop bits:  1 or 2

Fifth character:
        Xon/Xoff data flow control:
                E = Enable
                D = Disable

Sixth character:
        Control Code Filter:
                I = Ignore control codes
                N = Normal

Seventh Character:
        Line Feed on Incoming Data:
                N = C/R = C/R
                I = C/R = C/R + L/F

The string is broken at this point with a comma.

Eighth character:
        Mode Control:
                O = Originate Mode
                A = Answer Mode

The string is broken at this point with another comma.

Last Character, or number, can be 10, 20, or T.  The numbers are the pulse
dialing rate, T = tone dialing.

A more-or-less "normal" status would be M7I1ENN,O,T.  This would give you the
internal modem, 7-bit words, Ignore Parity, 1 stop bit, Xon/Xoff enabled, No
Filter, No added Line feed, Originate mode, and Tone dialing.  That setting
works fine with CompuServe.

Can the Model 200 do Xmodem protocol, and if so, how?


Fm: Tony Anderson 76703,4062

Xmodem is not built into the ROM of the 200.  It is designed for a variation
of the "capture" protocol, where you "capture" incoming data as it scrolls
across your screen.  It's often called "downloading", and uses the F2 button
at the top of the keyboard to control the capture function.

If you want to, or need to use the Xmodem protocol, then you have to use one
of the Xmodem terminal emulators which are available for the 200, which act a
lot like TELCOM, but give you added features; like downloading to, or uploading
from, a Chipmunk or DVI disk, or the cassette; split-screen telecommunications;
sending macros, and other bells and whistles.  Such programs are stored in
Library 10 of the forum libraries, and you can get a list of them with the
command SCA KEY=XMODEM at the library prompt where you can read or download
files.

On the down side, the extra program requires RAM space to run in, so there's
less room to up or download files in.

There are no other protocol programs available for the 200.  Take your pick,
"capture" or "Xmodem".
