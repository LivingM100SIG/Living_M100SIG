TEL200 is a TELCOM emulator with the "Split Screen" function.

It operates just like the built-in TELCOM program, except that it doesn't 
transmit the characters as they are typed, but holds them at a buffer, 
displays them at the bottom label line, and sends them when <ENTER> is pressed.




INSTALLING TEL200.LDR:

The file TEL200.LDR must be downloaded/uploaded in ASCII format. On the
Model 200 it will appear as TEL200.DO, which is an ASCII text file.

With TEL200.DO in RAM,
 1) Goto BASIC
 2) Type LOAD "TEL200.DO" and <ENTER>.
 3) Type CLEAR 200, 59555(*) and <ENTER>.
 4) Type RUN and <ENTER>
 5) At the first prompt 'Load Address?', type 59555(*) and <ENTER>
* You may set it other than 59555, but it must be less than or equal to 59555.
 6) At the prompt, 'Okay?', press Y.
 7) After loading and beeping, at the prompt 'Save as?', type TEL200 and <ENTER
>.

Now if you enter TEL200.CO instead of TELCOM, you have Split Screen function.



There are couple of additional modifications besides SS:

First, if you hold down SHIFT as you enter TERM(F4) mode, the phone line is 
not picked up, and carrier detecting is disabled.

It's useful for on line simulation with prerecorded communication -- See 
RECAP.TXT in DL3.

Also, it conserves battery if you are using acoustic cups.


Second, BRK(F7) function is omitted.



The SS(Split-Screen) comes on when you enter TERM mode, but it can be toggled
on/off with SHIFT-F1.
The label must be on, in order to turn SS on.
When you turn SS off with SHIFT-F1, all characters held in the buffer will be 
lost.

But just turning the label off will temporarily disable it, while the data 
in the buffer is retained, and turning it back on will let you continue with 
the line you were typing.


The following commands are available:

----------------------------------------
BKSP:  Backspace and delete

DEL(SHIFT-BKSP): Delete the character at the cursor

CTRL-U:  Clear the buffer.

CTRL-N:  Delete all characters after and including the cursor.

CTRL-B:  Delete everything before the cursor.

LEFT ARROW:  Backspace the cursor

RIGHT ARROW:  Advance the cursor

SHIFT-LEFT ARROW:  Move the cursor to the previous word.

SHIFT-RIGHT ARROW:  Move the cursor to the next word.

ENTER:  Send the current line, including a Carriage Return.

UP ARROW:  Send the current line, but omit the Carriage Return.

ESC or DOWN ARROW:  Enter a macro string - a single key stroke following this 
control code loads the corresponding macro from the macro file into the buffer.


----------------------------------------

About the macro:

The macro file should be named "MACROS.DO".

Each line in the macro file contains the macro string, with its single 
character name being the first character in the line.

For example, if the following data are in the macro file:

HHello
bBye
u73327,1653^MPassword^M
m^OGO M100SIG^M



Pressing 'H' after the control code loads the macro string "Hello" into the
SS buffer, or pressing 'm' loads this sequence of macro characters:
  CTRL-O, "GO M100SIG", and CR.
CR does not terminate the macro string, so if you have a word following the CR,

the word proceeding it will be sent first, then the nextword after the CR 
will be loaded.  As an example, if you press 'u', "73327,1653" is sent, and 
you'll see it scroll off and disappear, then the Password is loaded, and sent.

When you enter a macro, it is added to what is already in the buffer, so you 
can use it to save repetive keystrokes.

Logging-on is simpler with macro, but be careful about putting your password in

the macro file!


The maximum that the SS buffer holds is 132 characters.  It beeps when it 
becomes full.

When you reach 79 characters, it also will "beep".


The CTRL keys that are not SS commands are immediately transmitted, or if the 
CTRL key has no effect, i.e., pressing CTRL-U while the buffer is already 
cleared, will send CTRL-U immediately.



How to enter TEL200 by entering built-in TELCOM from the Menu:


You can make the TEL200 appear in place of built-in TELCOM, and
access it as you would a built-in rom program.

Just poke the address 62057 and 62058 with the entry address of TEL200, and 
from then on, you'll go into TEL200 when you choose TELCOM from the Menu.

Caution:

If you loaded the program in HIMEM, make sure that it's loaded there everytime 

you use it.  It's safer not to use this method unless it's loaded in LoMem
(See LOMEM.200 in DL10).



Using DIRACC.200 with TEL200:


A simple modification is needed in order to use DIRACC.200 with this program.

Line 50 of DIRACC.200 program has the sequence of hex characters "8B63".
"8B63" is the entry to TERM mode of the built-in TELCOM.  It has to be replaced

with the address of TERM mode of TEL200, which is equal to TEL200 entry + 430
For example, if TEL200 is loaded at 59555, the correct address is 59985,
and converted to hexadecimal, A3E8.  Then replace "8B63" with "A3E8".
Notice that least significant byte comes first.
