DVORAK.100 and DVORAK.200 are keyboard enhancement programs for the
 100 and 200.

It can do the following:

1) Let you type in either Dvorak or normal fashion.  The keyboard can be
 switched between the two modes at any time by pressing SHIFT+CTRL+BREAK.
2) Enable SHIFT,CTRL,GRPH, and CODE keys to lock if one of them is pressed and
 unlock after pressing it again, or pressing another key that generates a
 character.  So you can generate control and graphic characters by sequentially
 pressing key combinations, which is helpful if you don't have the full use
 of both hands and fingers and find it normally difficult to type some key
 combinations.  Although I can use all ten fingers, I sometimes find this
 feature convenient.
3) Vary auto repeat delay and speed.  Delay is the wait between the keypress
 and the begin of repetition.  Speed is the rate at which the key repeats.
  Make it repeat faster if you find the normal keyboard a bit too slow, or
 delay longer if some kind of handicap makes it difficult for you to release
 the keys quickly enough.
4) Make the keys "click" when you press them.  You can turn this feature on and
 off at any time by pressing CODE+SHIFT+CTRL+BREAK.


To install it,

1) Download DVORAK.100 or DVORAK.200 and convert it to a Basic program.
2) Run it and after you give it relocating information it will create
 DVORAK.CO and DVKINS.CO.
3) Delete all Basic files that are on the Menu that you might delete or edit
 after installing DVORAK.
4) Then run DVKINS.CO.  It will install Dvorak system and delete DVKINS.CO and
 DVORAK.CO automatically.
  When installed it takes up less than 500 bytes.


DVORAK.CO is the main program, and DVKINS.CO is an installer that lets you
 setup options and then does the neccessary chores to make DVORAK.CO
 memory resident.  The loader that creates DVORAK.CO and DVKINS.CO asks
 for End address for DVKINS.CO.  End is the location where last byte will be
 when it's LOADMed into memory.  For example, to load the 200 version at
 59000 to 60769, enter 60769.  Just pressing ENTER will let it be located
 just below current HIMEM.  If you have a disk operating system or something in
 HIMEM, just press ENTER to load the program right below it.  DVORAK.CO has
 a fixed location and the loader does not ask for its address, since it will
 be relocated by DVKINS.CO anyway.  After they are created, reset HIMEM for
 DVKINS.CO by entering this command from Basic:  CLEAR0,Top  (To find out the
 Top value, type LOADM"DVKINS").

Before running DVKINS.CO, remove from
 memory all Basic programs, except the unnamed program and those that are
 fixed in place.  These are likely the ones that have machine language
 programs poked into them and therefore are not runnable Basic programs but
 just serve as a space for machine language programs to run.  Those that
 you are going to either make changes to or kill should be removed temporarily.
  This is to insure that Dvorak code will have a fixed location, by being
 installed in a Basic file at the lowest possible location in memory, so there
 won't be any Basic files below it that might get deleted out and cause the
 code to change location by being shifted down to fill the hollowed out
 space, resulting in a crash - back to Jan 1, 1900 Sun 00:00:01 and counting.
  The Basic file containing Dvorak code is named "DVORAK...", and inivisible
 from Menu.  Since the extension is "..", it would not be possible to
 accidentally delete it using Basic's KILL command.  The removed Basic files
 can be loaded back after installation.

When you run DVKINS.CO, it shows you what options you will be installing.
  You can change these options by moving the cursor around and pressing space
 bar on the option that you want or don't want.  Press ENTER when ready or
 press ESC to abort the process.  Hold down SHIFT while pressing ENTER if you
 don't want DVKINS.CO and DVORAK.CO from being erased from memory.  After the
 initial setup, keyboard mode(Dvorak or normal) and clicking sound can be
 turned on and off during use by pressing SHIFT+CTRL+BREAK for keyboard
 mode and CODE+SHIFT+CTRL+BREAK for sound.  Other features cannot be
 changed once installed, unless the whole thing is removed and reinstalled.
  To remove it, just run DVKINS.CO again.  It will be killed automatically
 after installation or removal, so press SHIFT while removing to keep it from
 disappearing, if you want to reinstall.


It is believed that one can learn to type much faster on Dvorak than on
 Sholes system(QWERTY arrangement).  I personally prefer typing on Dvorak.
  I had learned the old system well, so starting over on a Dvorak was very slow
 and frustrating.  It took several months before I could begin to type
 comfortably.  If you are just learning to type, I would think Dvorak would be
 a better choice, but if you are already deeply entrenched in the standard
 system, it is my opinion that it's better sticking with it.  The main
 reason I had switched is that the QWERTY felt a bit awkward sometimes.
  For example, reaching for some keys like B and T annoyed me, since they
 were used quite often and farthest away.  This maybe no accident.
  I heard from somewhere that old machines had problem of keys locking up
 when the typist went too fast, so they rearranged the keys in the QWERTY
 fashion in order to deliberately slow him down.  I can still type the old way
 without problems if I had to, but it's somewhat slower now due to the
 confusion I make between the two.  Below is the Sholes and Dvorak
 arrangement for the 100 and 200 keyboard.  You can use a paper clip to
 gently pull the key caps off and rearrange them.  Be careful, since they
 are breakable.  Bend the paper clip in a U shape, and form tiny hooks at each
 end, using a long nose plier.  Hook opposite corners of the key cap and
 pull steadily.  Make sure there is even pulling force at each corner, so that
 the key cap will come off in upright position, not bend toward one side and
 cause the stem to break.  They don't come off too easily, so use sufficient
 amount of force.  You can keep a finger on the cap to keep it from flying out
 when it pops off.
