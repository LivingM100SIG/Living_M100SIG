---------------------------------------   Doc's for ALARM by Gary Sullivan    --------------------------------------- ALARM POWER 200 was made for the T-200      (Will it work on others ?)To set an ALARM "message" for any giventime do NOT put an extension after themessage. (ie .BA .CO or .DO) To stopthe alarm, hold down the SHIFT key andhit the LABEL key. You can SET as manyalarms as your NOTE.DO file will hold.To set the POWER alarm, (start a basicprogram) add a .BA after "Message".Read the POWER command in the basicmanual for further details. Note thatonly ONE RUN command can exist at anygiven time.             =-> Note <-=                  Both NOTE.DO and ALARM.BA MUST                  be in BANK 1              ---------------------------------------
