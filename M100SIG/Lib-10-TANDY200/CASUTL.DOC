

  CASUTL is a file save and load program.  It also verifies what has been saved.

  It records time and date on files, and file size on any file.  Date and file
 size are visible only on the files that had been saved previously with CASUTL.

  It is downloaded as a Basic program
 listing.  Run it and specify an
 execution address to create the program file CASUTL.CO.

Run the program(HIMEM needs to be changed first, if the execution address is
 below HIMEM) and do one of the following:


::: Save :::

Full file name - 
  The file extension, no matter what it is, is restored when loaded back.

A semicolon (;) - 
  Writes a 5 second silence, followed by one byte ;.CO file.  This is
 identified as "gap", when loading and verifying.  Consequently, do not use a
 semicolon as the first character of file names.

An asterisk (*) - 
  Saves all files in ram, excluding CASUTL itself.  There is a 3 second silence
 between each file.  After the last file, a one byte ;;.CO file is saved, to
 indicate end of batch, so that the program can know where to stop when
 loading/verifying a batch.


::: Load :::

 ; -
  Looks for the file name ;.CO, and stops the cassette and prints the message
 "Found - Gap" when it is encountered.

 . -
  Loads whatever file comes next, excluding the gap(;.CO)

 * - 
  Batch load.  Loads every file on cassette, until file name ;;.CO is
 encountered, or memory runs out.

 ? - 
  Looks for text file blocks, and loads  it as file ?.DO.  By adding a file
 name to ?, the text file blocks can be name as, or appended if that file
 already exists.  For example, enter ?MYF to load them as MYF.DO, or append to
 MYF.DO.  This would be useful in recovering parts of a text file lost due to
 IO error in one of the file blocks - if IO error occurs while trying to load
 a text file, the rest of file blocks that come after the point of error cannot
 be loaded, without some trickery.


::: Verify :::

 ?
  Displays text file blocks until the last block is encountered.

 . -
  Verify whatever file comes next.

 * -
  Verify all files until ;;.CO is encountered.

  Verify is successful if OK message appears, else is not and you will get an
 IO error.
  When verifying text files, its content is echoed on the screen.



  During any of the above three operations, SHIFT-BREAK aborts the current
 operation, reports IO error, and returns to the program menu.

  Press ENTER to exit the program - returns to where it was called from.

  CASUTL can be called to do a single operation and return, by calling its Top
 location+3.  When calling its Top+3, the parameters are:

  CALL N+3,ASC(C$),VARPTR(F$)

 N is the Top, C$ is a single command character(F,S,L, or V), and F$ is the
 file name ending with a CHR$(0) - F$=F$+CHR$(0).
