	CALNDR.CO is a ml program for the Tandy 200 that instantly produces 
calenders on screen.  For correct operation your computer must have BOTH the 
correct DATE and DAY.  The first calender is for the current month with the 
current date in reverse character mode.  Press the up-arrow and you instantly 
see the following month scroll up. Press the down arrow and you instantly go 
back one month.  You may go forward or backward as many months as you wish.  
Correct calenders should be produced back to 1582 (if you don't wear your 
finger out first).  Our current Gregorian calender started in October of 1582.
  Correct calenders should be produced as far into the future as you  care to 
go.  When finished press any key to return.

	If you are still using this program after December 31, 1999, you must 
change the last byte of the program from 19d to 20d.  This can be done by 
changing the very last character in the hex listing from a 3 to a 4.  It may 
be unrealistic for me to think that any of these already antiques will still 
be in use at that time, but I'm not sending out any upgrades so you'll just 
have to remember.

	This program is 638 bytes, just small enough to fit into the alternate
LCD area of memory in the model 200.  Use HEXFER.CO to convert the hex listing
into ml.  If you want it to run in the alternate lcd, specify memory address 
63408 at the apropriate prompt.  I wish I could have made it 324 bytes so it 
could have fit as a utility in X0S200.  Maybe one of you hotdogs can figure 
out a better way.  Enjoy!
