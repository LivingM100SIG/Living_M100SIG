Docmentation file for SKT200.BA, GRF200.CO, and LD2GRF.BA by Robert
H.Pigford, (c) 1991, Newark, DE 19711.
For the T200, last update: 02/02/91
        ----
SKT200.BA and GRF200.CO work together to provide dot-by-dot T200 LCD screen
pixel editing, 12 sizes of screen dumps (for Epson 9 pin or compatible
printers), saving of screen images to PICTUR.CO filenames assigned by the
user, and retrieval/re-editing of any of those PICTUR.CO files from RAM.

The PICTUR.CO files created by SKT200/GRF200 have a 0 execution address so
they will return you to the T200 main menu if accidently loaded 
(inadvertantly using the cursor bar on them).  The machine language program
GRF200.CO will be 4738 bytes long (including a 3840 byte buffer for the
PICTUR.CO saving function).  The resulting saved PICTUR.CO files are
each only 3840 bytes long.

The GRF200.CO program is CALLed by SKT200.BA as a way of providing
graphics screen prints in any of 12 different Height and Width
combinations.  The 1 wide X 1 high printout is great for printing a small
logo at the top of a page with a letterhead.  The 4 wide X 4 high
printout will almost fill the paper and is great for scientific graph
printouts.  GRF200.CO does not reset all the printer settings so, when
finished, you will not have to reset your margins, bold, etc.  Hitting
Shift-Break while printing will return control to the M100 program but your
printer may be locked in graphics mode requiring you to turn it off and back
on to completely clear it.

LOADING:
--------
Download LD2GRF.BA in .DO format.  In BASIC, type LOAD"LD2GRF".  When loaded,
type SAVE"LD2GRF".  Then with LD2GRF.BA created and stored in RAM, you may type
KILL"LD2GRF.DO" to recover some memory
space.

Run LD2GRF.BA to create the GRF200.CO program.  LD2GRF.BA asks you to choose
where in memory GRF200.CO will always load and run.  If you don't want it up
under the current HIMEM, choose a starting address so the required 4738
bytes of memory will not conflict with any other machine language program
which you may wish to have active at the same time (like your Disk Operating
System).  When the loading is complete, you are offered two user determined
configuration choices:

1.  Want Linefeeds sent to your printer upon printouts <Y/N>?  Some people set
their printers to automatically throw in a linefeed every time it sees a
carriage return.  If so, then chose <N>.  If you want the program to supply the
needed linefeeds, choose <Y>.

2.  Set printer linespacing value.  Most Epson compatible printers use 24
(actually 24/180 inch).  Printers using other values for their graphics
vertical line spacing include the Gemini-10X which uses 16.  If you don't know
 about your printer, use the "24"
default value and see if the printouts have spaces or overlaps in the print.

If you later decide to change these values or wish GRF200 to operate at a
different address, you will have to run LD2GRF.BA again.  SKT200.BA is designed
to find GRF200.CO in RAM and extract
the CALL addresses it needs prior to running.  PICTUR.CO files made with
previous versions of GRF200.CO or even 1920 byte files made on the M100 using
SKETCH.BA will be compatible with the T200 version here (1/2 screen only).

RUNNING:
--------
Download SKT200.BA in .DO format.  In BASIC, type LOAD"SKT200".  When loaded,
type SAVE"SKT200".  Then with SKT200.BA created and stored in RAM, you may type
KILL"SKT200.DO" to recover some memory space.

RUN the SKT200.BA progam.  At the first menu, press Enter to continue with
LOADMing of GRF200.CO into high memory.  The HIMEM value will be set
automatically.  
Note: I have removed the detailled instructions from SKT200.BA to keep it
small. In their place, some instructions are added to the end of this DOC
file.
At the MAIN MENU, choose <N> to create a new picture.  The dot will start at
the upper left corner.  Move the dot around with the keypad directors.  The
space bar toggles it on and off.

When ready to Save or Print the screen contents, hit </> to bring up the
GRAFIX choices on line 16 of the picture.  You may then choose:

<Q>uit returns you to Editing where you left off.

<P>rint will prompt you for your choices of Height multiple, then Width
multiple desired.  When the Width choice is entered, the printout begins.  If
it dosen't, check that your printer may be offline.  If so, put it online to
begin.
<S> to make a SAVE.  When GRAFIX completes a screen scan, it clears the
screen and asks you to <1> choose a filename for saving, <2> return to
editing the same sketch, or <3> returning to the Main Menu.  Choosing
<3> for Main Menu will ERASE your picture so be wure to SAVE your work
first!  Using the same filename as an existing filename will overwrite the
old copy.  Make frequent saves and even change filenames if you wish to save
different copies of the same picture.

To work on an old file or to get it on the screen so you can print it, choose
<E> at the SKT200 Main Menu.  When asked for a filename, enter the name of
your picture file in RAM (don't use the extension).  If SKT200.BA can't find
it, it will tell you.  If found, your picture file will unroll onto the
screen and leave you in dot editing mode.  TOGGLE the dot on/off with the
<SPACEBAR> to help locate it.

Instructions:

The "keypad" keys form the 8 directional keys to move the dots around.

	&  *  (
	u     o
	j  k  l

Toggle the dot on/off with the spacebar.  Drawing with an "off" dot will erase.

Notes and Hints:

Use the Ctrl+ARROW keys then the <D> combination as a quick way to draw
lines, borders, etc.

The Shift+ARROWS moves the dot 16 pixel at a time up/down and 12 pixels left/
right so, if started from an edge, it can be helpful in choosing where to
place text (text chrs. are 8 dots high x 6 dots wide).

When using the <D>raw function, that the second <D> can be cancelled by 
hitting Cntrl-D.

The <T>ext function is also handy for making selective erasures.  Just put
the dot near where you wish to erase, hit <T>, then use the spacebar to print
spaces over the graphics.  Once erased this way, however, the dot graphics are
gone.  You will have to redraw them if wanted (or Edit your recently saved
RAM file again).  If you hit <T> and then change your mind, just hit <ENTER>
to finish and get back to dot editing without having put any text over the
graphics.

Using Shft-Grph-x in the <T>ext mode will can quickly fill the screen with
full characters of all dots.

Have fun!
