Directory ordering program (DIRORD)

Program length (Bytes) - 148

Program Installation:

    Thrs program is written entirely in machine langauge and is 
specific to the Tandy 200. To install it on your machine first 
download the program, (which is a text form of a BArIC program).Then 
set HIMEM to a value below where you wish the M/L program to start, 
and load and run the BASIC program. It will ask you for the ending 
address for the file. The M/L program is relocatable to anywhere in 
memory from the current HIMEM to MAXRAM - program length. If you just 
enter a return, the program will be loaded just below MAXRAM. The 
current line count and address are listed as the file is being 
created. Any character or checksum errors will be reported and the 
program will abort. At the end of the program, the M/L program will be
saved as a .CO file, and you will be returned to the main menu.

Program execution:

    Uihs little program orders the directory on the model 200. 
Ordering is in ascending alpha order. The files will still be listed 
out in the .DO, .BA, .CO order on the screen, but will be alpha sorted
within each type. (The directory itself is alpha sorted, but the 200 
routine which draws out the menu breaks it down as .DO, .BA, .CO).

****  WARNING  ****

    I have run this under a variety of conditions, (number of files, 
etc.), and haven't had it bomb, but until you have verified it works 
for you, make sure you have a backup of all files. Clobbering the area
around the directory can cause your machine to hang up so bad you have
to power down memory to reset it. Save all files in ALL banks before 
playing with this.

Any comments/suggestions/etc. would be appreciated.
