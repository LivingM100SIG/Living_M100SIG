           MYTIME helps you manage Appointments, Memos, Activities and
   things To-Do.  It utilizes a cursor-driven, full-featured perpetual
   calendar and includes virtually instant, function-key recall of any
   record-set plus a variety of other time-use functions.
           MYTIME can automatically set alarms for each appointment and
   does NOT have to be running for alarms to work because it fully
   utilizes the "always on" alarm feature of the T200.  This permits you
   to set alarms and do virtually ANYTHING else in ANY bank while knowing
   that your alarms will sound to remind you of appointments etc: your
   T200 doesn't even have to be turned on for alarms to sound!
           MYTIME is EASY to use but please read ALL of these instructions
   before running it.
   
		       GETTING STARTED
                       ---------------
           Download this instruction file as MYTMDC.DO and the program,
   MYTIME.200, as MYTIME.DO.  Checksum MYTIME.DO after removing extraneous
   characters and load and save it as MYTIME.BA.
   
           You will also need three invaluable utilities by Wilson Van
   Alst loaded in Bank 1: ZIPFYI.CO, ZIPSRT.CO, and ZIPSUB.CO.  They can
   be found in DL10.
   
           MYTIME creates and uses a specially formatted version of the
   Bank 1 file NOTE.DO which should NOT be used for any other purpose.
   (MYTIME performs most functions of SCHEDL within NOTE.DO.)  If you
   currently have a NOTE.DO file which you've been using with SCHEDL,
   you'll have to decide what to do with its data BEFORE running MYTIME
   for the first time: then *KILL* NOTE.DO!  (You can use SCHEDL later
   with MYTIME's NOTE.DO if necessary.)
   
           Summary: MYTIME.BA, ZIPFYI.CO, ZIPSUB.CO and ZIPSRT.CO in Bank
   1.  (You can keep the "ZIP" pgms and NOTE.DO invisible if you prefer.)
   
   
                       GENERAL
                       -------
           While using MYTIME, both UPPER and lower case letters work.  A
   simple <ENTER>/CR at any prompt is understood to mean "no" and will
   usually take you to the next prompt or previous menu.  When you
   encounter a flashing cursor next to "?", type "Y" to approve; any other
   key means "no" except where "Y/N" shows: then a specific "Y" or "N",
   <ENTER> is needed.  If you see the message "(CR ends)" in the lower
   right corner, press <ENTER> to return to the previous menu.  CR =
   <ENTER>.
           Most errors are trapped and won't interrupt operation: see
   "ERRORS" below.

                       HOW TO USE
                       ----------
           Run MYTIME by cursor selection at the main menu.  The current
   month's calendar and a row of function key labels will display. 
   Today's date will be enclosed in parentheses and under the cursor.
           The arrow keys and spacebar move the cursor around the calendar
   just like the T200 menu: the date under the cursor is used by F2 "Find
   Appt" and F7 "Add New" routines as their "default" value.
           You can also press <SHIFT> and the arrow keys simultaneously to
   quickly display "adjacent" months and years:
                   SHIFT/Up: Adds a year
                   SHIFT/Dn: Subtracts a year
                   SHIFT/Rt: Adds a month
                   SHIFT/Lt: Subtracts a month
           These keys work regardless of what month/yr combination is
           displayed.  Whenever you move "away" from the current month, F1
           will return to "this" month.

                       FUNCTION KEYS
                       -------------
           <F1> "Any Mnth"/"This Mnth"
             Whenever the current month is displayed, you can "jump" to
             any other month/yr by pressing F1. Enter the digit/s of the
             desired month at "mm?": CR alone uses the current month.
             At the "yy?" prompt you have three options:
               1) Press CR alone for the current year
               2) Type one or two digits and 1900 will be added
               3) Type more than 2 digits and that year will be used.
                  (max value 9999)
             The cursor will always start on the 1st of a new month and
             the label over F1 and its function change to "This Mnth".

           <F2> "Find Appt"
             Displays appointments for the cursored date.  Appointments
             for which an alarm has been set will display a "<" between
             the time and message. "Open" appointments, for which no
             specific time has been set, will display an "*" in place of
             the time notation.

           <F3> "Find ToDo"
             Displays To-Dos.

           <F4> "Find Mems"
             Displays all your Memos.

           <F5> "Find Acty"
             Displays all Memos, To-Dos and Appointments pertaining to a
             specific "activity".  (See F7 below.)

           <F6> "Find Data"
             Prompts you for a search string (max: 15 char.) and displays
             all records containing that string.  The search routine is
             NOT case sensitive: "CAR", "Car" and "car" will find the
             same data.


           <F2> - <F6>
             The routines called by function keys F2 through F6 all finish
             by asking if you want to "Print", "Copy" or "Edit" the
             records found: a "Y" selects the option, any other key
             continues to the next option prompt.
             PRINT/COPY: sends pre-formatted data to either a printer or
             a RAM file named ">xxxxx.DO".  Any graphics characters used
             by MYTIME will NOT show in the printed or copied data.
             EDIT: offers re-date, "file" and delete for "open" appts,
             and "file" and delete for To-Dos and Memos.  Records will
             re-display one at a time for:
                   <R>edate:  permits you to substitute a different date
                    for any "open" appt.  It uses the same date routine
                    described in F7, "Appointment" below.
                   <F>ile:  either "tags" a NOTE.DO record as "filed" for
                    future reference or "un-files" a previously "filed"
                    record.  Filed records won't display individually
                    during subsequent searchs but can be deleted or
                    "un-filed" using these routines.  The number of filed
                    records will display in the lower left corner after 
                    each search request and these records will be labeled
                    "(Filed)" when printed, copied or edited.
                   <D>elete: removes the record from NOTE.DO after
                    prompting "Sure?!": "Y" deletes; any other key keeps.

             (As these routines operate you may notice lines of text
             display very briefly at the bottom of your screen: this
             is a normal function of the editing routines.)


           <F7> "Add New"
             Use this to enter new items: press the appropriate single
             letter at the sub-menu.
             <A>ppointment:  The cursored date will display followed by a
              "?".  If this date is OK then press "Y": any other key
              begins a new date prompt; CR alone returns to the sub-menu.
                 Type a new DATE.  (If you want an appointment to repeat
              annually then use two spaces instead of digits for the "yy"
              entries: e.g."07/04/  ".)  When you're satisfied with the
              date press CR: if incorrectly formatted then a beep will
              sound: otherwise press "y" at the "?".
                 The TIME routine is next:
                   - You can leave the time "open" by pressing CR only. 
                     This will substitute a "*" for the time.
                         OR
                   - Type a 2-digit hour, ":" (colon), and 2-digit minutes
                     using 24hr notation.
                 If you enter a valid time it will display and prompt "?".
                 If OK then press "Y": any other key or incorrectly
                 formatted data will beep and begin the time prompts again
                 Next you'll be prompted for the "MSG".  CR alone aborts
                 to the sub-menu, otherwise enter up to 58 characters and
                 press CR.
   
           NOTE: to prevent an "accidental" key-press from going
                 un-noticed, the following "Alarm" and "Activity"
                 prompts require a CR after your one-letter response.
   
                 If you wish to set an ALARM for this appointment type "Y"
                 and a CR: otherwise "n" and CR. (Alarms are not possible
                 nor prompted for "open" appointments.)
                 Finally you'll be asked if this appointment is "ACTIVITY
                 related".  If you answer "Y" then the activity list will
                 display: press the NUMBER corresponding to the activity
                 and CR.  CR alone returns to the prompt.  (See "Name for
                 Activity" below.)
   
             <T>o-Do:  Here's where to keep things "to-do".  Just enter
              your message and answer if activity related.  CR alone
              returns to the sub-menu.
   
             <M>emo:  Same routine as To-Dos.  (Keep "action" items as
              To-Dos and use Memo to store reminders etc.)
   
           NOTE: If you need to include a date in a Memo or To-Do then
                 DON'T use the standard format "mm/dd/yy": use 07-04-90 or
                 Jul 04, 1990 etc. (This prevents MYTIME from mistaking
                 the date for an appointment.)

             <N>ame for activity:  This is where you store and change up
              to ten 5-character "Activity" titles.  Type the number of
              the title to change or the number of a blank field to add a
              new title: then enter up to 5 characters.  Press CR and the
              changed titles display: press another number to change
              another title or simply CR to return to the sub-menu.
   
           <F8> "MENU"
              Exits MYTIME and returns to the T200 main menu.
   
   
                       USAGE HINTS
                       -----------
           MYTIME keeps NOTE.DO sorted in the following order:
             1) Appointments by date
             2) Memos alpabetically (each preceded by a GRPH/m)
             3) To-Dos alphabetically (each preceded by a GRPH/t)
           Within each category may be "filed" records that contain a
   GRPH/f character: this will be the ninth character in dated records and
   the second character in To-Dos and Memos.  If you wish to "un-file" a
   record just use the "file" option within the "Edit" routines: "file" is
   a "toggle" and simply reverses the status of a record.
           NOTE.DO is always sorted within a record category by the ASCII
   "value" of the message portion (e.g. "A" is "less" than "a" ).  You can
   "prioritize" To-Dos and Memos by simply preceding the message text with
   a character or group of characters that is "less" than any of the
   others.  Preceding a To-Do message with "1", for example, would cause
   that To-Do to list ahead of other To-Dos which might begin with an "A".
           You MAY remove records manually from NOTE.DO but it's easier to
   simply search within record categories using F2-F5 or use F6 to search
   for a common string, "/" or GRPH/f for example. Then use the "<D>elete"
   option within the "Edit" routines.
           Be careful if you CHANGE record data while using TEXT or
   SCHEDL: each record is rigidly formatted for MYTIME. It is surer (and
   quicker) to simply delete the record and re-write it.
   
           MYTIME was uploaded with asterisks for all the activity titles.
    I suggest changing these to "blanks" because MYTIME traps for "empty"
   titles chosen by mistake.  You can remove an activity title by simply
   typing a single space as its new name and pressing CR.
           Be creative with your activity titles: "$$$$$", "House",
   "Xmas", "TxDed", "Expns" etc.
           MYTIME stores the 10 activity titles in a line of its code. 
   Whenever you answer "y" to the activity related question at the end of
   a record entry and select an activity, a graphic character unique to
   that activity, in the ASCII range 225-234, is added to the END of that
   record.  When you use F5 "Find Acty" this character is used in the
   search process.
   
           Users of TODO.200 will find that their NOTE.DO file can be
   easily adapted for MYTIME use.  Change all appointments to the format:
   "mm/dd/yy,hh/mm,text..." and replace the word TO-DO with a GRPH/t in
   each To-Do record.  Run MYTIME to ensure that records display
   correctly.  The file called ALARM.DO which was used with TODO.200 can
   be killed as it is no longer needed.  (You may want to first print a
   copy for use in adding your alarms to NOTE using MYTIME.)

           MYTIME correctly formats and initializes all your alarms but
   you should learn how the T200 reacts to alarms under various operating
   conditions and how to use SHIFT/LABEL when an alarm sounds: read page
   22 of the owner's manual.
   
           You MAY use CTRL/C to interrupt operation but I recommend
   F8/"MENU" instead.
   
                       ERRORS
                       ------
           Most potential errors are trapped but the odd problem might
   interrupt operations: re-run MYTIME and see if it recurrs.  If the
   solution isn't obvious then drop me a note with the details.
           Un-trapped errors will display and END operations.  You may
   re-run MYTIME from BASIC or the main menu.
   
                              ------CREDITS-----
   
           I'm very grateful to Gary Davis, Paul Globman and Wilson Van
   Alst for taking the time to try MYTIME and suggest many of its
   routines.

           Wilson Van Alst's ZIPFYI.CO permits almost instant record
   access: without it MYTIME would not have been written.  His ZIPSRT.CO
   is twice as fast as any other sort program and further contributes to
   MYTIME's speed.  Van's ZIPSUB.CO does all editing work in a flash and
   his ZIPFMT.CO was indispensable in creating this DOC file.

           The calendar algorythms were taken from TODO.100 by Phil
   Pearsall.
   
                                ------------------
   
           I hope you find MYTIME useful.  Please drop me a note on the
   Sig or via E-Mail to let me have your comments, problems or
   suggestions.
