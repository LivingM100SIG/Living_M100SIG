                -----------------------------------------------

        NODFND.CO is a 2264 byte, machine language, RAMPAC text file utility
which gives you the ability to quickly and easily perform a variety of search
and print functions on RAMPAC ".DO" files without moving the files into RAM. 
NODFND takes about 15 seconds to search 100k of 60 different RAMPACK .DO
files, examining each file line by line for a string.  Its report response
time is primarily limited by printer or LCD display speed.
        Neither the Node ROM nor RAMDSK.CO(c) is necessary for successful
operation but NODFND does require N-READ.CO(c) and XOS-C.CO(c), both written
by Paul Globman.

                        SET-UP
                        ------
        The "HEX" code for NODFND.CO is contained in NODFND.HEX (DL10). Down-
load it into a separate Text file.  (If you have a checksum program I strongly
suggest using it here to confirm your download accuracy before proceeding.)
Then use James Yi's HXFER.CO (DL10) to convert the .DO file into the
machine language program NODFND.CO: create NODFND.CO at the "default" address
by pressing <ENTER> at the HXFER address prompt.  Save a back-up copy for
future use.
        NODFND operates in HIMEM between memory addresses 58840 and 61103 and
executes at 58840.  It can be run with one of the simple BASIC loaders shown
below or with a loader created using Paul Globman's MAKLDR.BA (see MAKLDR
note.)  NODFND expects XOS-C to be correctly installed in all three banks and
N-READ.CO to be in Bank 3.  If N-READ.CO is not in Bank 3, NODFND BEEPs and
returns to the T200 main menu.

                        OPERATION
                        ---------
        The NODFND main menu provides a brief reminder of each function.  The
function keys (FK) operate whenever the FK labels display.  NODFND operations
examine ONLY files with a .DO extension with the exception of "Files" which
includes .DP, .DW and .DC files.
        The string search functions will accept any combination of 20
characters or less and are NOT case sensitive: searching for "cat" will report
"cat", "Cat", "CAT", and any other string which contains the data entered:
e.g. "indicate".  (If you only wanted to report strings which contain the word
"cat", for example, then you could preceed the search string with a space:
" cat".)  NODFND reports the whole string in which a search string occurs but
it will NOT report a match if potential matches overlap the 255 byte points in
any lines of data longer than 255 bytes. (e.g. unformatted files)
         <ENTER> alone at any input prompt will return to the previous prompt
and pressing the <ESC> key while any sub-routine is running will abort the
function and redisplay the FK label line.  If any routine cleared the top
line, the NODFND main menu redisplays.
        If the <SHIFT> key is pressed along with one of the first four
function keys, then NODFND will send the function results to a connected
printer.  The lprint routines print spaces in place of any character whose
ASCII value exceeds 126.  The <PRINT> function key operates in the usual
manner at any screen.


                      - Function keys -

        Files:  lists RAMPAC .Dx files in alphabetical order: if you have more
than 60 files then the display will pause and wait for any key press before
continuing.  When all files have displayed, the FK label line redisplays.  The
lprint option prints extensionless filenames 10 to a line, 70 columns wide.

        Scan:  searches ALL files for a given string and displays the NAMES of
any files containing matches.  If more than 60 files contain a match then the
display will pause for key input before continuing.  When all match files are
shown, "done!" will display and a tone will sound with the search string data
displayed: any key press returns to the FK label line.  The lprint option
prints the filenames AND the match strings; each preceeded with a "-".

        Find:  searches ONE file for matches and displays each string
containing the match.  The display pauses with each full screen and waits for
any key press.  If the screen pauses with only a partial match string shown
then the first display on the "next" screen will be the entire match string. 
	If your file contains lines longer than 254 bytes, then NODFND
examines and reports these lines as separate 255 byte "segments" and only the
first 254 bytes will display of any matched segment.  Each match display is
preceeded by a "-".  When "done!", any key press will return you to the
"String:" prompt and you can re-search the same file if desired.  The
lprint option prints the filename and strings.

        Read:  scrolls a file for viewing.  The screen will display the
filename, size and the first 14 file lines, then pause for any key press.
Subsequent key presses will scroll or pause the rest of the file until the
entire file has displayed.  Any key press will then re-scroll the file.  Use
<ESC> to exit the Read function at any time.  The lprint option prints the
file as found with no header or size information.

        Help:  clears the screen and restores the function descriptions.

        Fmfd:  sends a Chr$(12), "Form Feed" to the printer.  (This is useful
when printing files or different lists.)

        Rdsk:  will cross-bank load and run RAMDSK.CO(c) from Bank 3.  If
RAMDSK.CO is not in Bank 3 then NODFND beeps and returns to the T200 main
menu.

        Menu:  returns to the T200 main menu.


                        ERRORS
                        ------
        If N-READ.CO is not in Bank 3 then NODFND will BEEP and return to the
T200 menu: likewise with RAMDSK.CO.  If you enter a bad or non-existent file
name then the FK labels redisplay.  If a printer is not connected and
"on-line", a BEEP and "No printer!" message displays for 2 seconds before
returning to the FK labels.
        It is possible that your printer might go "off-line" during an lprint
function thereby preventing NODFND from continuing or exiting to the T200
menu.  If the keys don't operate during or after using the lprint option,
check to ensure that the printer is on-line and loaded with paper.  NODFND
is written to send a Carriage Return after any lprint routine ends and
expects the printer to always remain on-line during lprint functions.


                	Loader Programs
                	---------------
        Here are two simple BASIC loaders to run NODFND.  Copy them into BASIC
and run them as needed: the cross-bank loader can, itself, be run cross-bank
using the XOS-C "CMD>" key.

         0 REM:same bank
        10 CLEAR0,58840:RUNM"NODFND"

         0 REM:cross-load from Bank 3 with XOS-C installed
        10 CLEAR0,58840:CALL41179:X$="3:NODFND.CO"
        20 CALL63600,8,VARPTR(X$)
        30 IF PEEK(61302) THEN END ELSE CALL58840


                MAKLDR.BA operation
                -------------------
        Paul Globman provides a universal, self-clearing, cross-bank loader
program called MAKLDR.BA(c) to registered XOS-C users.  This invaluable
program permits XOS-C users of programs which require HIMEM space (like
NODFND.CO) to create individual 81 byte .CO loader programs which
automatically clear the correct memory space for ML programs AND cause the
programs to reset HIMEM=MAXRAM at exit!
        If NODFND.CO is run cross-bank from Bank 3 using one of these loader
programs then you'll never have to worry about setting HIMEM for it.  AND,
whether you exit to the T200 main menu using NODFND's "Menu" key OR you exit
to the menu using RAMDSK's "Menu" key, HIMEM will be cleared of EITHER program
and reset to 61104 (MAXRAM)!
	If you use a "MAKLDR" loader to run NODFND, then you can run RAMDSK.CO
from the NODFND menu and you wouldn't need a separate loader for RAMDSK.

                        --- Acknowledgments ---
        Paul Globman wrote XOS-C.CO, N-READ.CO, and RAMDSK.CO.  He also gave
me the benefit of his machine language expertise in helping me make NODFND
do want I wanted, as well as offering encouragment and much sound advice about
program operation, during his many hours of Beta testing.
                        -----------------------


        I hope you find as many uses for NODFND.CO as I have.  Please send
        comments and suggestions to me on the M100 SIG or CompuServe E-Mail.
