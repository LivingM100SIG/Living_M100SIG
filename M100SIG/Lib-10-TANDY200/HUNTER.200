   HUNTER.CO (c) 1990 by Larry Sloan, 76616,3015.

   HUNTER.CO will quickly search all the .DO files in ram for a string.  It is
machine language.  It is not case specific -- 'hello' will yield 'HELLO'
and 'Hello'.  It will flash the entire line up to the CR in which a string
occurs.  The file name will appear in reverse video and then any found 
strings and then at a keypress the next file in ram will appear and be 
searched.
   
   This might be useful for writers who want to see how often they have used a
particular phrase in different files.  Also, if you keep a lot of files in ram
 containing parts numbers or descriptions you may find this helpful.
   
   HUNTER.CO runs in the alt lcd of the model 200.  It is _NOT_ relocateable
using HXFER.CO.  There are four bytes that do not relocate using HXFER, but
most users find machine language programs that run in the alt lcd are
quite compatible with their set ups.
 
   Use HXFER.CO to convert the following into ml.  Copy below the line and 
place into a separate file then run HXFER.CO.  At the prompt for location,
simply press ENTER as this is _not_ relocateable.
