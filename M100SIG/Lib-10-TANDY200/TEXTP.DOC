TEXT+ adds these features to TEXT:

1. word wrap disable.
2. overwriting character.
3. appending copied or cut text to the paste buffer.
4. backward text search.
5. search and replace, locally possible.
6. emptying paste buffer - when you don't have enough memory to paste as 
normally.
7. display cursor's coordinate and offset from beginning of file.
8. placing markers - mark a location and later quickly jump to it.
9. delete selected block of text.

* Note to Ultimate Rom II users: TEXTP is not compatible with UR-2.  There 
will be problems if you use TEXTP and UR-2 together.

To get started, download TEXTP.100 from DL7, or TEXTP.200 from DL10.

TEXTP.100 and TEXTP.200 are Basic program listings.  Convert them to runnable 
Basic program by going to BASIC, then LOAD"TEXTP".  If there isn't enough 
memory to do this, you can either first save TEXTP.DO to disk or cassette, 
then "LOAD" from there, or use DO2BA.  DO2BA.200 is in DL10, DO2BA.100 in DL7.


Run the converted Basic program.  It will create two CO files, TXPDAT.CO and 
TXPINS.CO.  Before it creates TXPINS.CO, it asks for its "END" location.  Just
pressing ENTER at this prompt will set execution location for TXPINS.CO to 
right below current HIMEM.  If you are not sure of what value to specify as 
the "END" location, just press ENTER and it will run safely.

Then set up the configuration file, which is at the end of this DOC file.   
Initially, it is set up so that all features will be installed.  You can omit 
the features that you do not need(save memory) by changing the information in 
the configuration file.  If you don't use the configuration file during 
installation, all features will be installed and defaults set up in a standard
way.

Then run TXPINS.CO to install TEXT+.
If you run it and it just gives you a beep or ?OM error, you will need to 
change the HIMEM setting.  To do that, go to BASIC, LOADM"TXPINS", and see 
what the "Top:" value is.  Set HIMEM to this value by typing CLEAR 0,Top, 
whatever value "Top:" is.

  The first time TXPINS.CO is ran, if all is well, it will display the 
progress messages for each function installed.  "Size:" indicates how many 
bytes a function takes up.  When finished, it asks "Clean up?".  Press Y to 
delete the files TXPINS.CO, TXPDAT.CO, TXPCFG.DO.  Press N if you don't want 
them deleted automatically.
If all is not well, there are 3 possible ways it could have gone wrong:

1. not enough memory - needs about 2K free to install all features.
2. file directory full - there are too many files in the file directory to 
hold TEXT+.  Delete some files and try again.
3. Basic programs need to be removed - Because TEXT+ is a machine language 
program, it needs to reside at a fixed location.  The installer will try to 
bury it in the lowest location possible in memory, so that changes to other 
files will not affect its memory location.  Having Basic programs present 
during installation prevents it from doing this, so that if you edit later on 
one of these Basic programs located below TEXT+ location of TEXT+ will be 
affected and something horrible will happen.  Its location will also be 
affected when you change the LOMEM value.  Be aware of programs that put 
things in LOMEM.  Problem with LOMEM can be avoided if you install the 
programs that reside in LOMEM, before installing any programs such as TEXT+, 
which is a pseudo Basic file, occupied by machine language codes.  If you 
already have TEXT+ installed and want to install a LOMEM program, remove TEXT+
, install the LOMEM program, then reinstall TEXT+.

  When installed successfully, the "TEXT" will be changed to "TEXT+".

  TEXT+ can be removed by running TXPINS.CO again.  If while trying to remove 
it, it says something like "vector $xxxx is used.." it means some other 
program has changed information at that memory location after TEXT+ was 
installed.  TEXT+ cannot be removed unless that vector is restored with the 
value that the installer put in.  If it says "Above files need to be 
removed.." it means other pseudo Basic files were installed after TEXT+.  In 
that case, they need to be removed first, before TEXT+ can be removed safely.


To create the configuration file, cut the information below the dotted line 
and paste it into a new file and name it TXPCFG.DO.  You don't have to use the
configuration file if you want all the features installed and are happy with 
the defaults as are.  Configuration file allows you to omit unneeded features 
, change the default settings, and select different keys to control the 
settings while in use.  Specify your specifications in the "configuration 
boxes": [].  There are two boxes for each function, one to indicate whether or
not the function is to be installed/omitted, and another to specify its 
default parameter.  In the "Install" box, put Y to install, N to omit.  In the
"Parameter" box, there may be one, two, or zero parameters to set.  [-] 
indicates there are no parameters to set.  [B] in the function #4, for 
example, indicates that <ESC>,<B> will be used to do a backward search.  You 
could change it to [F], for example, if you prefer <ESC>,<F>.  In function #1,
[1,W] indicates that <ESC>,<W> will be used to toggle word wrapping on/off, 
and number 1 indicates that the word wrapping will initially be enabled.
  Most functions are toggled with the escape sequence(pressing <ESC> and then 
another key) the bottom line indicating with up/down arrow whether it's been 
turned on or off.  Undefined escape sequence results in the key after <ESC> 
typed.
  The configuration file data is about 4K but can be reduced to 1K if you 
delete all the explanations, etc.  Just be sure to leave in the ">Install.. " 
and ">Param.. " lines.


Cut here and paste into TXPCFG.DO:
---------------------------------------

1. Word wrap: <ESC>,<?>

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [1,W] -- 0=disable, 1=enable


2. Character overwrite: <ESC>,<?>

  While in overwrite mode, pressing <SHIFT> with <SPACEBAR> lets you insert a 
space.

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [0,O] -- 0=Insert, 1=Overwrite


3. Paste buffer append: <ESC>,<?>

   Holding down <SHIFT> when you press <F5>(Copy) or <F6>(Cut) temporarily 
reverses the default setting.  So if the default is "normal", pressing <SHIFT>
+<F5> appends selected text to the paste buffer.

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [0,A] -- 0=Normal, 1=Append

4. Backward Search: <ESC>,<?>

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [B]


5. Search & Replace: <ESC>,<?>
  Can be done on the whole file, or on a selected portion.  Use <F7> to select
the portion that you want to do "local" search & replace on.  If no text is 
selected, it will be done on all text after the cursor.  If you want to abort 
it when it asks for "Pause?" and "Case?", press <CTRL>+<C>.  If you want to 
abort it when it's in the process of doing automatic search and replace 
without pause, press <SHIFT>+<BREAK>.

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [S]


6. Unload paste buffer: <SHIFT>+<PASTE>

   Pressing <SHIFT>+<PASTE> empties the paste buffer content to the file, for 
the situation in which there isn't enough memory to paste as normally.  You 
could use this function another way, to insert text at the beginning of the 
current paste buffer content; move cursor to end of text to insert, do <SHIFT>
+<PASTE>, extend highlighting, and cut.

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [-]


7. Show cursor position: <ESC>,<?>
   Turn on the LABEL by pressing <LABEL> and you'll see the cursor's 
coordinate on the screen, and the offset from begin of the file of the text 
it's pointing to.  Cursor movement becomes sluggish when it's being shown, so 
you may want to turn LABEL off most of the time and turn it on only when 
neccessary.

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [1,C] -- 1=on, 0=off


8. Marking: <ESC>, [<TAB>], <0 to 9>

  To place a marker at the cursor, press <ESC>,<TAB>, and a number from <0> to
<9>.  <0> is special in that it redistributes the markers 1-9 at evenly spaced
intervals throughout the file.  To get back to the location where you placed 
the marker, press <ESC> and then <0> to <9>.  <0> is special; it takes you to 
the previous cursor location just before last event, like Pasting, Finding, 
CTRL-Z(Down Arrow), and exit, reenter and immediately doing <ESC>,<0> takes 
you to the location just before the previous exit.

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [1,T] -- Cursor tracking: 1=on/0=off. <ESC>,<T> turns cursor 
tracking on/off.  You may want to turn it off if the cursor movement feels 
sluggish.  Tracking allows automatic adjusting of markers as you edit the 
file.  If it's off, markers shift and lose their position as you insert and 
delete text preceding them.


9. Block delete.
  To delete a chunk of text, select it using <F7>, and press <SHIFT>+<DEL>.  
It's like cut operation using <F6>, except that the text cut is not stored in 
the paste buffer.  Handy if you want to delete a large block of text but don't
want to affect the data holding in the paste buffer.

>Install: [Y]
>Parameters: [-]
