Directory utility for the model 200:

    This little program lets you look at the 200 directory in more 
detail than doing a FILES, and in addition lets you make files visible
or invisible.

Program options:

    From the main menu you can list files, make them invisible, or 
make them visible. The file listing option will give you a list of all
valid user files, if they are visible or not, what the directory entry
address is, and what the starting address of the file is. The listing 
is by page, when the page is full, the program will beep. Hit any key 
to continue. If you chose to make file/files visible/invisible, you 
will be given the option of a single file, all files, all .DO files, 
all .BA files, or all .CO files. These options do just what you would 
expect them to.


Any comments/suggestions/etc are welcomed.
