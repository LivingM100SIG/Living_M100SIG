Hear ye, hear ye, Here commeth the long awaited answer:
  In a test run using this program:
	5 T1$=TIME$
	10 IF T$<>TIME$ THEN T$=TIME$: PRINT T$
	20 GOTO 10
  the answer is:
        06:15:xx
  In other words, from a full charge, the computer will shut down on low
  voltage in  6 hours and 15 minutes.

  Now then, there are three ways to extend the life of the batteries:
  I. Use 6V power supply such as the one sold by Radio Shack for $5.95
     (plus tax).
 ][. Turn the computer off when not in use, or execute from basic:
	POWER 10
     This will shutdown the computer after 60 sec of no input from the
     keyboard. If the computer is running a program from basic, this
     will not work - the computer will continue running until Low Volt
     Shut Down occures.
III. Deep cycle the batteries. This is the process by which you may re-
     cover some of the capacity in the NiCd battery. As strange as it may
     seem, keeping a NiCd fully charged will actually cause it to lose
     some of its storage capacity. The easiest way to raise the battery
     capacity (once it has been lost due to disuse) is to deep cycle
     it a few times. This is accomplished by draining them to ZERO.
     Using a tape player works fine. Play a tape until the motor stops.
     This ensures the batteries are dead. Next, charge the batteries
     for an entire day. Repeat this cycle five times or so. Your NiCds
     should be near full capacity now. Whenever your batteries seem to
     give out sooner than usual, deep cycle them a few times and they'll
     be up to par again. NOTE: Most NiCds have an effective life of
     1000 charge/discharge cycles. If your batteries are beyond this
     point, you might not be able to bring them back up.
