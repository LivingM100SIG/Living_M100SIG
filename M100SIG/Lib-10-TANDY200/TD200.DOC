Modified for the T200 by Curtis Karnow [73047,3120] from TODO.PJP by Phil 
Pearsall

	The M100 program has been modified for the M200 as follows. (1) some
routines have been eliminated because I don't use them; (2) taking advantage of
the 200's larger screen, there's more room for notes and appointments, and one
may have all such notes on the screen simulataneously with the calandar; and
(3) I added a short program to give the local time in two other cities.

	You must read the orginal documentation, TODO.DOC in DL7; I don't repeat
that here. The function keys still do the same thing, except that (a) certain
keys are disabled if I excised the function, (b) I added a function, as
described below, and (c) I enabled a few more function keys to assist in
getting around the program.


Routines Eliminated.

	You can get the eliminated routines from the original TODO.PJP and merge
them in with this program. The Calculator adds about 1298 bytes, and the Phon
routine adds about 342 bytes. Make backup copies of everything before you begin
to fool around!

	(1) The addrs/phone routine at lines 300-315 of TODO is eliminated. 
Reasons: m~b adrs.do is too big to work in the same RAM bank as TODO; my adrs 
isn't set up in a form that TODO recognizes, and TODO doesn't search for
partial internal strings, i.e. it needs the exact full name as entered in ADRS,
which is too much to ask of me! If you add the routine back in, edit Line 15 by
inserting between "Entr" and "Alrm" the word "Phon", and editing Line 16 by
inserting "300" instead of "800". If you do this, my time zone routine (see
below) will have to be either erased or moved to another function key: erasing
in line 15 the last PRINT@ statement is the simplest way to handle this.

	(2) The Calculator routine at lines 500-554 is gone. It's a good 
program: If you have the room, merge it in. If you do, edit Line 15 to insert 
the word "Calc" between "Alrm" and "Cal"(as always, ensure the total number of
[letters + spaces] within quotes in line 15 remains exactly the same).


Routine added.

	Other time zones. Function key 3 now calls a little routine at line 800
et seq: New York and London time are provided. Set your own cities and times by
changing lines 810 and 850: change 3 or 8 to the figure representing the # to 
add to local time to get the time you wish. Change lines 815 and 855 to three
letters of the cities you refer to. If you don't want this routine, (a) erase
lines 800 and following, (b) erase "800" from Line 16 (but leave in all commas)
and you'll save about 470 bytes.

	Option. Line 16-- put in what you want instead of "Nota Bene"-- just
keep the same # of total [spaces +characters] between the quote marks.

	Option. Put in your own initials, or just erase mine (CEAK) in line 17.
	Hint. When inserting notes and appointments, remember that the GRAPH and
CODE keys work. E.g. GRAPH P puts a little phone on your screen to remind you
to call someone. And you can replace (in the program's printing of function key
lines) the "CHR$__" print commands with the GRAPH or CODE equivalent directly
inside quotes. That uses up less RAM.
