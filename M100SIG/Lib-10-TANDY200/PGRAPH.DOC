PGRAPH.DOC

	PGRAPH.DOC is the documentation for the PGRAPH.200 program, a Model-200
specific program that draws Cartesian graphs on the 200 LCD, and then if
desired will lprint the graph to any of the Radio Shack Dot Matrix Printers
with graphics mode (100, 105, 110, 120, 200, 400, 420, 500, 2100).
	The program will first request a series of scaling prompts:
	"X: MIN,MAX" - enter minimum, maximum X values.
	"Y: MIN,MAX" - enter minimum, maximum Y values.
	"X-AXIS SCALE" - enter the desired scaling of X-axis tick marks.
	"Y-AXIS SCALE" - enter the desired scaling of Y-axis tick marks.
	The program will then request the number of points to be entered,
followed by the data points themselves.
	Once the data is entered, the graph will appear on the LCD, along with
the following menu:
	<R> TO REDO
	<L> TO LPRINT
	<ENTER> TO END
	Inputing 'R' will restart the program; 'L' will dump it to the printer;
and the 'ENTER' key will quit the program.
	If 'L' is entered, the program will request title and axis labels, and
then will print the graph. Once printing is done the following menu will
appear:
	<D> TO LIST DATA
	<R> TO RUN
	<ENTER> TO END
	'D' will print the data, 'R' will restart the program, and 'ENTER' will
end the program.

	I have tried to make the program as "user-friendly" as possible, and
modifications to print more than one set of data points on the same graph are
fairly straight forward. Any problems or questions, let me know.
