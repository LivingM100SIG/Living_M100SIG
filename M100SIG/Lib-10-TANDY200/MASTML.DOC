M/L MASTER PROGRAM FOR THE MODEL 200:

    This program allows a number of machine langauge programs to be 
used, without having to keep the program both as a .CO file, and above
HIMEM. The program works by remembering what the last M/L program used
was.

    This program can be used with any machine language programs which 
are not self modifying.

Program operation:

    For this program to operate correctly, all M/L program calls must 
be through the program. The response of the program when entered 
depends on the current HIMEM setting, and what was last run. Each case
is listed below.

HIMEM=MAXRAM:

     The program lists out the current .CO files, and asks you to 
chose one. Entering the letter for a file will cause that file to be 
loaded into high memory, deleted as a .CO file, and then executed.

HIMEM=?????, No previous program run:

    If the program has no record of a program being loaded, and HIMEM 
is below MAXRAM, it will say unknown file loaded, give you the current
HIMEM value, and ask you if you wish to continue. If you say yes, you 
go to the .CO file selection menu, and whatever was above HIMEM is 
lost.

HIMEM=Start address, previous program run:

    If the current value of HIMEM is the starting address for the 
previous program run, (which is the case under normal operation), you 
will told what program has been found, and given the option of exiting
with no action taken, running the program, or saving the program back 
as a .CO file. If the latter option is chosen, you will then go to the
.CO file selection menu.

HIMEM=?????, previous program run:

    If there was a M/L program loaded by this program, and HIMEM is 
altered, you will get the message HIMEM altered, FILENAME lost, where 
FILENAME is the name of the .CO program which has been lost. You 
should, if you never mess with HIMEM or run other programs outside of 
this program, never get this message.

Notes and limitations:

    It will appear after running this program that all your M/L files 
are gone. They are not gone, they are just made invisible. To make 
them visible, see the program DIRUTL or similar.

    Users of Multiplan, take heed. Multiplan messes with memory, do 
not leave anything there if you are going to use Multiplan, save it 
back as .CO file first.

    There is a limitation on the total number of M/L files in the 
directory, and that number is 15, because most people don't have more 
than that, and that's all the lines I've got.

    There is no limitation on the starting address, you can have more 
than one program with the same starting address, so long as you don't 
run them or load them outside of this program.

    The program saves information on the last program run in an 
invisible text file named "@@@". This file name is reserved if you use
this program, there can be no other files by that name, either .CO, 
.BA, or .DO.

Any comments/suggestions/etc are welcomed.
