Word counter (WRDCNT)

Program length (Bytes) - 315

Program Installation:

    This program is written entirely in machine langauge and is 
specific to the Tandy 200. To install it on your machine first 
download the program, (which is a text form of a BASIC program).Then 
set HIMEM to a value below where you wish the M/L program to start, 
and load and run the BASIC program. It will ask you for the ending 
address for the file. The M/L program is relocatable to anywhere in 
memory from the current HIMEM to MAXRAM - program length. If you just 
enter a return, the program will be loaded just below MAXRAM. The 
current line count and address are listed as the file is being 
created. Any character or checksum errors will be reported and the 
program will abort. At the end of the program, the M/L program will be
saved as a .CO file, and you will be returned to the main menu.

Program execution:

    This program just accepts a .DO file name, and returns the total 
number of words and lines in the file. Words are defined as contiguous
character strings separated by space/spaces, or control characters. 
Lines are defined as carriage returns. (Note that in the case of text 
files, the number of carriage returns is usually indicative of the 
number of paragraphs, not lines, since the line length is variable 
depending on how the file is printed).

Any comments/suggestions/etc. would be appreciated.
