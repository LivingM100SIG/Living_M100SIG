            XRUNCO.200 & MKXRUN.200
            -----------------------

	These two programs operate together to give the T200/XOS-C.200 user an 
easily accessible "pull-down" menu for Bank-3 .CO files: XRUNCO.200 is the 
small menu program (655 bytes empty, 850 full); MKXRUN.200 is the 652 byte 
program which makes XRUNCO: use it to create XRUNCO's menu.
	ONLY XRUNCO needs to be kept in Bank 3. MKXRUN.200 can be kept 
elsewhere and needs to be run in Bank 3 only when you need to change the data 
in XRUNCO. XOS-C must be loaded and active in all three banks, of course, but 
no other programs are required to run XRUNCO.

	XRUNCO was written to permit XOS-C users to automatically load and run 
as many as 26, Bank-3 .CO programs in Bank 1 or 2 with a single key-press. It 
eliminates the need for separate cross-bank "loader" programs (about 80 bytes 
each) AND it automatically checks for memory conflicts, clears the correct 
HIMEM for the chosen program and runs it.
	On the other hand: if you don't use programs that alter MAXRAM or if 
you only have a few .CO files that you run cross-bank or if you don't mind 
typing the name of the "loaders" then you may not need XRUNCO.200 at all.

	SET-UP
	------

	Download this file and XRUNCO.200 and remove any garbage.  Checksum 
XRUNCO.200 and save a copy somewhere.  The file XRUNCO.200 contains TWO 
programs: XRUNCO and MKXRUN. Use TEXT to SPLIT the file into two short 
programs, LOAD and SAVE each program as named in their top lines: XRUNCO.BA and
MKXRUN.BA. Copy both programs to Bank 3.

	*** NOTE: Although XRUNCO can be used with any name it MUST be named as
XRUNCO.BA and on BANK 3's menu whenever you run MKXRUN.BA! ***

	 Cursor select MKXRUN.BA from the Bank 3 menu with at least 1500 bytes 
free ram. If you have at least one .CO file in RAM, the "first" .CO file's name
and TOP/END addresses will display near the bottom of the screen below all your
other files. Press "Y" or "y" if you want the file included in XRUNCO; any 
other keypress will move to the "next" .CO file.
	After you have made a choice for each .CO file, MKXRUN will clear the 
screen, MERGE the new data into XRUNCO and return to the menu. You can review 
the files included in XRUNCO by simply cursor selecting it from the menu. (
Press ENTER to return to the MAIN menu after you've reviewed XRUNCO's menu.) 
	If you want to make any changes simply re-run MKXRUN. When you're 
satisfied with your choices you can kill MKXRUN. Rename XRUNCO as CMD>.BA if 
desired. Since MKXRUN.BA re-creates XRUNCO's data statements each time it runs 
you must re-select each .CO file to be included in XRUNCO.


	OPERATION
	---------

	XRUNCO is VERY simple to use. With the cursor over the BASIC program 
slot in either Bank 1 or Bank 2 and the XOS-C "Cmd>" prompt displayed over F3, 
just press F3:
		If you've chosen to rename XRUNCO as CMD>.BA then having CAPS 
LOCK on will automatically run XRUNCO/CMD>.BA
		If you prefer to keep XRUNCO.BA as a separate .BA file (named 
as CO.BA for example) then leave CAPS LOCK off and type in it's name.

	In either case you'll see the T200 menu clear, quickly redisplay and 
then reclear to present XRUNCO's previously created menu of Bank-3 .CO files. 
At the "?" prompt press the letter (UPPER/lower case OK) that corresponds to 
your desired file and it will be copied into the correct memory area from bank 
3 and run: otherwise press ENTER to return to the Bank's menu.
	That's all there is to it!

	Hint: Since XRUNCO clears all buffers and sets HIMEM=MAXRAM each time 
it runs, it can be used as a quick memory clearing routine by simply running it
from the Cmd> prompt and pressing ENTER to return to the menu. 


	ERRORS
	------

	XRUNCO first clears HIMEM to equal MAXRAM. If you keep a HIMEM program 
loaded in Banks 1 & 2 at all times then you can change the command "MAXRAM" in 
line 2 of XRUNCO to that program's "TOP" value: be certain that any .CO 
programs you run using XRUNCO are written to work "under" this value (or above 
61104) or they'll overwrite your himem program.
 	XRUNCO then checks to see that your chosen program's END address isn't 
between current MAXRAM and 61104. If it finds a MAXRAM conflict it BEEPs twice 
and ends after printing "CAN'T". Re-run and try again if you chose the wrong 
file, otherwise correct the MAXRAM conflict: either by removing the program 
which lowered MAXRAM or using a version of your .CO file designed to run BELOW 
the MAXRAM value.
	If there is some other problem XRUNCO will double-BEEP and print the 
error code. If the code is 17 then chances are the .CO file isn't in Bank 3 or 
there's not enough memory left in the "home" bank. Other errors are rare: send 
me an E-PLEX if they re-occur.


	MKXRUN and MAXRAM checking
	--------------------------

	When MKXRUN creates the line of data in XRUNCO that stores your Bank-3 
file info (LINE 50) it makes certain assumptions.  It assumes that the ONLY two
different MAXRAM values T200 users will encounter are 56672 (FLOPPY with the 
TDD2) and 58960 (POWR-DISK). If you're not sure about YOUR MAXRAM then simply 
go into basic and type ?MAXRAM.
	If you use ANY other programs which lower MAXRAM to some value other 
than 56672 or 58960 and intend to run additional .CO programs WITH THE 
DIFFERENT MAXRAMs LOADED then use extreme caution to prevent corrupting the 
first program!
	Users of RAM based TS-DOS should be aware that the "resident" portions 
of various versions ARE different than FLOPPY and POWR-DISK. I would strongly 
advise you to switch to POWR-DISK. It's FREE for the download time in DL9 (bro 
key: PDSK*) and really a better DOS all around!
	(If there is some reason you NEED to use some program that lowers 
MAXRAM to a different value then let me know and I'll work with you to see what
can be done.)
	Programs which have been created (or "re-assembled") to run BELOW these
values are coded as such by MKXRUN and will run OK via XRUNCO.  Any ALT/LCD 
program can easily be run with XRUNCO although many of the "new" generation XOS
-C programs require a .DO (TEXT) file under the cursor when selected at the 
main menu so using XRUNCO to run them defeats their original purpose.

	CREDITS:
		Wilson Van Alst wouldn't let me quit until I had this down to 
under 850 bytes (full menu) so you can thank him for your extra RAM!
		Paul Globman's outstanding XOS-C is what let's us keep all our 
"indispensable" files in a separate bank for use anywhere!

	Please send problems and comments to me.
