	** MAYDAY.200 INSTRUCTIONS **

	Introduction:

   MAYDAY is a fast, small (30-byte) .DO-file recovery program for the T200 
computer.  After a cold start, it will let you restore TEXT files if they 
still exist in RAM (and in most cases they do).
   Aside from this document, you need to download MAYDAY.200 -- a BASIC 
program that creates the recovery routine as a machine language file called 
MAYDAY.CO.
   The BASIC program is not needed to run MAYDAY.CO; so once you have the m/l 
file you your menu, you can get rid of the .BA file.

--------------------------------------
	Using MAYDAY.CO:

 o For multi-bank computers:
   If you have more than one RAM bank in your T200, you should keep a copy of 
MAYDAY.CO in the bank that is least likely to suffer a cold start.  Or, you 
can keep it in _two_ banks, virtually guaranteeing it'll be available no 
matter which bank goes down.
   Right after a cold start, move to the bank containg MAYDAY.CO and use <F4> 
to copy the program into the bank that crashed.  Return to that bank, select 
MAYDAY with the widebar cursor, and press <ENTER>.  The program runs in a 
buffer above MAXRAM; so there's no need to CLEAR memory before running it.
   Skip to the part of these instructions called "Recovery Hints:".

 o For single-bank computers:
-   MAYDAY.CO should be stored as a .CO file on cassette.  (It could also be 
kept on disk; but during recovery you would have to load your DOS before 
loading MAYDAY, and the DOS would probably over-write a lot of the memory 
you're trying to save.)
    After a cold start, stay in the bank that crashed, and connect your tape 
recorder.  Then go into BASIC and type:

	RUNM"CAS:MAYDAY"

		...followed by <ENTER>.
   The program will load and run, and in a few seconds you'll return to the 
main menu.

--------------------------------------
	Recovery Hints

   After you've run MAYDAY, you'll see a 19,400-byte file named "FOUND.DO" on 
the menu.  It contains everything that was recoverable from your computer's 
memory after the crash.
   You will use the <SELECT>, <CUT> and <PASTE> functions to restore your 
original .DO files; but first pay attention to this WARNING:

	IF YOU PUT MORE MATERIAL IN
	THE PASTE BUFFER THAN YOUR
	REMAINING MEMORY CAN HOLD,
	YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
	<PASTE> THAT MATERIAL TO A
	NEW FILE.

   With that in mind, you should make efforts to free as much memory as 
possible by eliminating "garbage" from FOUND.DO -- before cutting and pasting 
the material you want to recover.

   If you had BASIC programs in RAM before cold-starting, they will be at the 
start of FOUND.DO in their 'tokenized' form.
   The "garbage" from these .BA files can be eliminated by <SELECT>ing and <
CUT>ing it, and not putting it anywhere.

   There will also be "garbage" that follows the useful material in FOUND.DO. 
It, too, should be eliminated with the <SELECT> and <CUT> process.

   Finally, you'll be left with the material you want.  You should still keep 
the WARNING in mind and be judicious about the size of the blocks you <SELECT>
and <CUT> for movement to a new file.

   To help you locate the dividing line between two previous files within 
FOUND.DO, MAYDAY inserts a graphics character as an end-of-file marker.  It is
the small right-arrow created by pressing the <GRPH> and <L> keys 
simultaneously.  You can use the <F1> 'Find' function to search for this 
character in FOUND.DO.

--------------------------------------
	Nothing's Perfect:
   When you move MAYDAY.CO into a cold-started bank, the program over-writes 
the first 45 bytes of user memory.  If you formerly had a BASIC program larger
than 45 bytes in that bank, you should not lose any part of your previous TEXT
files.  But, if you had no .BA programs, you'll lose a small section at the 
start of the first .DO file.  Not ideal; but not terrible, considering the 
alternatives.
   By the way, if you accidentally run MAYDAY.CO in a "good" bank, it should 
do no harm.  It will create a file named FOUND.DO, but it will not write 
anything there.  You can simply kill FOUND.DO, and the bank will be just as it
was.
