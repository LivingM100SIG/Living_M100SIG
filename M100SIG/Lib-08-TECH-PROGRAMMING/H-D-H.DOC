This program was adopted from a program, D-H-D.100, originally written by Phil
Wheeler. The program does Hex to Decimal or Decimal to Hex conversions. My
program will allow you to do a whole program from a RAM TEXT (.do) file and
let you output to Ram, Cas, Lcd,(Screen) or Lpt(Printer). You can also do
single conversions if you wish.


This program was written more for fun and a challenge than a need.
I'm just starting to write programs and thought that this would be a nice test.

It uses some of Phil's function keys for selections and the Instr() keyword.
The program has built-in pauses in it when displaying Files (LINE 50), and all
screen display routines. I've tried to make it as easy as possible to run from
just the menus.	If anyone has the urge or need help yourself, any and all
feedback is welcome. Any questions leave a message I usually sign on about once

a week.
