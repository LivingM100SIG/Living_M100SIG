If you are real anxious to get figFORTH running on a new system you may be in 
luck IF:
	1) Your system has 16K of RAM open between 41216 (A100) and 57344 (E000
) and somehow you can get FIG4TH.CO
 loaded into that area of RAM.
	2) You can run a short BASIC program or a few of direct mode BASIC 
commands without messing up FIG4TH.
	3) You can save the RAM occupied by FIG4TH back to tape or disk after 
you've modified it.
	4) Your system has the same ROM routines as the Radio Shack Mod 100 to:

		a) Check the keyboard queue for a key (KEYX 29296 7270H).  No 
entry conditions.  Returns Z set for empty queue, reset if keys pending and 
carry set for BREAK key.
		b) Wait for and get a character from the keyboard (CHGET 4811 
12CBH).  No entry conditions.  Returns ASCII char code in A, C set if special 
char, reset normal char.
		c) Print (with expanded tabs - no big deal) a char on printer (
PRTTAB 19285 4B55H).  Enter with char in A.  No exit conditions.
		d) Display a char on the LCD screen at the current cursor 
location (LCD 19268 4B44H).  Enter with char in A.  No exit conditions.
	e) Return to the main MENU (MENU 22423 5797H).  No entry conditions.  
Exits to main MENU.

Note that these routines just have to exist, we didn't say where.  If you were 
real desperate you could write them yourself!

I'd be willing to bet that the NEC 8201, the KYOCERA, and the Tandy 200 all 
have these routines and could be modified.  It will be awful tight in the 200 
tho.  The 200 doesn't have enough room for FIG4TH to exist as a .CO file so it 
will have to come directly in from tape or disk with the help of a fancy DOS.  
I'm not sure if there's enough room to run the modification program but you can
check and poke using direct commands.

Want to try it?  Here goes....
1) Determine the location of those five routines in your computer's ROM.  Check
around on the SIG, they probably are there.  Might not hurt to write 'em down, 
you'll need them.
2) Get FIG4TH loaded into RAM and return to BASIC.
3) Load MODFIG.OTR and enter your ROM routine addresses into the last data 
statement.  Check them.  RUN.  You should wind up in FORTH!
4) Type BYE to get back to the MENU.  SAVE the figFORTH system as instructed in
the DOCS.
