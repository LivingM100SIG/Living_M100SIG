PWRTIP.001


As mentioned in TDDTIP.001 by Tony Anderson, it is possible to run both the
M100/200 computer and its disk drive from a single power source.  This is
done by making a "Y" attachment for the power cord from the transformer.  A
second cord is soldered in parallel with the original about a foot back from
the plug, and a second plug attached, from which to supply the disk drive.  The plug is Radio Shack stock #274-1569 (2 for $.99).

However, at 400 milliamperes, I have found the standard Tandy power
transformer to be a bit marginal in this application.  Occasionally, a "low
battery" light will appear, and disk access fails.  I worry less about that
than data garbling/gobbling.  Radio Shack does not seem to have a more
powerful version of the 6V transformer one might substitute.  However:

I stumbled across a  power transformer supplying 750 milliamperes, and having
the correct tip and polarity for the Tandy 100/200 computers, available for
only  $3.50 from All Electronics Corp., in Van Nuys, CA.  It is their catalog
#DCTX-675.  They have a toll-free number: 800-826-5432 (in California it is
800-258-6666 ).  There is a minimum $3.00 shipping/handling charge.
