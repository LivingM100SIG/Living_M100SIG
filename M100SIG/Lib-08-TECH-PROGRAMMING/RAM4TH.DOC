About RAM4TH

HISTORY

Michael Weiblen [72506,2072] uploaded a FORTH compiler (FORTH.4TH) to
CompuServe in 1986.  His compiler was based on the FIG-Forth model.
(Forth Interest Group, PO Box 8231, San Jose, CA  95155)  I downloaded
the file, but found it difficult to use since I didn't have a disk.  I
deleted the words pertaining only to disks and modified it to allow
loading Forth code from the normal Model 100 sources (RAM:, CAS:).  I
converted the executable file to a relocatable ASCII version, and
uploaded it as RAM4TH.RLC.  From every indication I have, all of the
code that this program is based on is in the public domain.  I reserve
copyright rights to the version that I have uploaded, but it may be
used and distributed freely by anyone.


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

After conversion from hex format, RAM4TH is a machine-language program
designed to run on a Model 100 as it was sold by Radio Shack.  Since
the changes to the 102 are minor, I believe it would also run on a
102.  Although it should run with 16K of memory, I doubt that it can
be converted to a M/L file with that little memory.  Machines with 24K
of memory and some type of mass storage (I have cassette) are able to
download, convert, and run this compiler.  The present version
requires that 12,784 bytes of RAM be reserved in high memory for use
by RAM4TH.


INSTALLATION

Download RAM4TH.RLC and save it as RAM4TH.DO in your Model 100.
Obtain RLCLDR.BA from CompuServe, if you don't have it already.
Transfer RAM4TH.DO to a cassette or other mass storage device (I will
write the rest assuming you are using casette).  Erase RAM4TH.DO from
RAM.

Now you need to decide where you want to locate RAM4TH when it runs.
As mentioned above, it needs 12784 bytes of high memory.  A standard
Model 100 has MAXRAM at 62960, so RAM4TH can start at 50176.  In a
machine with other programs in high memory, subtract 12784 from the
lowest high-memory address reserved to obtain the starting address.
The remainder of these instructions are written assuming you are
locating it at 50176.

Enter BASIC.  Type

        CLEAR 256, 50176

Load and run RLCLDR.BA.  Press 1 to load the machine-language program.
Answer CAS:RAM4TH.DO to the prompt "File to load ?".  When the file is
found, the program prompts for the starting address; respond by typing
50176 (or other address) <ENTER>.  When the file is loaded, RLCLDR
tries to write the .CO file to the tape, which is still in the play
mode (don't blame me).  You can abort it using <SHIFT><BREAK>, or let
it finish and press 3 to exit.  Now, you have a copy of RAM4TH in
memory, at 50176 (or possibly another address).

Return to BASIC.  To save memory, I like to leave the compiler loaded,
and run it via a 7-byte m/l file.  To do this, type

        SAVEM "RAM4TH", 50176, 50176, 50176

It is also a good idea to save a copy in m/l form, so you don't have
to go through the slow conversion process every time you have to
reload it.  To do this, position the tape and press RECORD, then type

        SAVEM "CAS:RAM4TH", 50176, 57563, 50176

If you have located it at another address, just make sure that the end
address (the 2nd number above) is 7387 more than the start address.

I also find it convenient to run RAM4TH from within BASIC.  To do
this, type

        NEW
        10 RUNM"RAM4TH
        SAVE "RAM4TH

The primary reason I recommend this step is to enable the function
keys, especially F8 (Menu).

Run RAM4TH by simply pressing F4.  (You can run it subsequently by
selecting RAM4TH.BA from the menu.)

Now, you probably want to know how to exit.  Being careful to use
capitals and spaces exactly as shown, type

        : Menu MENU ;

When you press ENTER, RAM4TH should respond with

        Ok { 0 }

The 0 indicates that there are no items on the stack.
Congratulations, you have just entered a Forth definition (like a
subroutine)!  Now, assuming you are running RAM4TH from BASIC, as
described, you may press F8 or type MENU to return to the main menu.
