Another GW-BASIC tip:

If you're attempting to convert Model 100 family BASIC programs to run under
GW-BASIC, and find cases of Integer division in the Model 100 programs
expressed by the backslash character "\" (GRPH-hyphen), you should be aware
that it doesn't work exactly the same as it does in Model 100 BASIC.

For purposes of illustration, let's use the example:

	A = 7.5\4	or  A = X\Y

In Model 100 BASIC, this returns an integer in A, which is equal to "how many
times will 4 go into 7.5 evenly, or Y into X, disregarding any leftover".

In GW-BASIC, Both values are rounded UP or DOWN to the nearest integer first,
THEN the division is made.  In the case of the above example, 7.5 would be
rounded UP to the whole number 8, then the formula becomes:

	A = 8\4

which sets A to a value of 2.  If 7.5 were 7.4, then it is rounded DOWN to
the whole number 7, which sets the value of A to 1.

Likewise, if the number 4 were 4.3, it would be rounded down to 4.0, and if it
were 4.5 or greater, it would be rounded up to 5.0, causing other division
problems.

This might cause some problems in calculations, in getting accurate results in
programs which are converted from Model 100 BASIC to GW-BASIC.  Converting such
statements to the equivalent

	A = INT(7.5/4)	or  A = INT(X/Y)

provides the expected result.
