The Model 100, as designed, provides several programs supplied in ROM and 
the ability to design and write programs that will run in RAM.  If you go into 
BASIC you can enter direct commands, such as FILES or LOAD "PRGRAM" and the 
Model 100 will display the files or load the program PRGRAM.BA.

This is fine but you must be in BASIC for these commands to have any meaning.
 At the menu of the Model 100 you can use the widebar cursor to select a 
program you wish to run, but wouldn't it be nice if you could type in 
"commands" and make the Model 100 do what you want?

Well you can type in a filename and press ENTER, and that file will run, 
but it's not quite the same as typing a command... or is it?

Suppose you have a program like RUN.BA or KILL.BA (see Portable 100, Jan. 
1989).  These programs can be made into "commands" by...

  a) making them invisible so they do not appear as programs

  b) removing the .BA so you only need to type RUN<cr> or KILL<cr>.

RUN and KILL are unique programs in the sense that they only operate on the 
file that is under the menu widebar cursor.  By making them invisible and 
removing the .BA, these programs take on the characteristics of commands 
instead of programs.

Select the program you wish to make into a command, such as RUN.BA.  With the 
cursor over RUN.BA, type CMD.BA<cr>.  RUN.BA will disappear, but don't 
worry... it's still there.  It's invisible and the .BA was removed, so 
you can use RUN as a command from the menu when running a .CO program that 
would normally require HIMEM to be properly prepared.

CMD.BA is used to make a file invisible and remove the file extension.  I have 
only experimented with BASIC programs and feel confident that the use of 
CMD.BA with basic programs will work as expected.  

NOTE: If you run CMD.BA from the menu by selecting it with the cursor and 
pressing enter, it will operate on itself and become invisible (and the 
.BA will be removed).
