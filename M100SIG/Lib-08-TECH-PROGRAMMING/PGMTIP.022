I've been doing some reasearch on the Model 100/102
for a floating point library for the new C100 'C'
compiler and was looking at a disassembly of the RND
function.

The routine checks the value in parenthesis RND(0) or
RND(1). If the value is zero it just reloads the
last generated pseudo-random number, but I was intrigued
by a call that was issued if the value in parenthesis
evaluated to a negative value.

Lo and behold!! If the value is negative (any value), it
is used to re-seed the generator.

This is of course not mentioned in the manual, and I have
seen no reference to it anywhere else.

I tried it out in BASIC and it seems to work.

It should be possible to extract any random numbers from
the system, build a negative value and re-seed the generator.

10 SEED=VAL(RIGHT$(TIME$,2))+VAL(MID$(TIME$,4,2))+FRE(0)
20 SEED=0-SEED:X=RND(SEED)
30 FOR A=1 TO 5
40 ?RND(1):NEXT A

The above program creates a negative seed from the seconds, minutes and
the amount of free memory. In the above example the free memory
won't change, but for a game program presumably the state of the
computer changes from time to time.

Any way this program produces a different sequence every time it
is run (because of the changing time).

Don't know if anyone has come accross this before. I checked other
references and couldn't find anything.
