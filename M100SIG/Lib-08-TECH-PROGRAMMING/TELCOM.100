Model 100 TELCOM Alterations
by Terry Kepner
    I've found a way to combine several special TELCOM
features into only two function keys: F6 and F7. 
Previously you had to choose two of these three possiblities:
a clear screen, a files display, or a free ram count---and 
without removing any RAM (Random Access read/write Memory) from 
normal program use.
    This little two-line Basic program assigns the ""clear 
screen'' command to the TELCOM F6 function key, and combines the 
files display and free RAM count into one TELCOM function key: 
F7.
    As a plus---instead of leaving the cursor at the end of the 
free RAM count, as the previous POKEs did---this program's pokes 
fix TELCOM so the cursor remains on the line below the free RAM
count. This makes for a cleaner and more legible display as you 
continue telecommunicating.
    The program works by taking advantage of the fact that each 
of Basic's function keys is allocated 16 bytes of RAM, no matter 
how much you actually use. Well, Basic function key F8 is 
assigned the command MENU. Pressing this while in Basic will 
return you to the Model 100 main menu. This command uses only 
five bytes of the sixteen allocated (the fifth byte is a 
carriage-return that terminates the Menu command), leaving eleven 
bytes. Which just so happens to be one byte longer than I need 
for my TELCOM modification. My program defines 
the Basic F8 key as the command MENU followed by a character 
string that includes the machine-code for calling the Files 
function, determining the free RAM and then sending a carriage-
return/linefeed to the display. This is followed by the POKE 
commands that tell TELCOM where to find this code in memory.
    The second line of the program sets the TELCOM F6 key to 
perform a clear screen.
    For you techy types, 205 is the machine-code equivalent 
of a call, and 201 is a machine code return. The other numbers 
in line 10 are the addresses called (in standard low-byte high-
byte order). You'll note that there are three calls. The 
return, 201, sends control back to TELCOM. Otherwise the program 
would cause your computer to crash, and possibly force you to 
cold-start it and lose all your programs.
    Naturally, if you cold-start your computer, or use a 
program that changes the assignments of the BASIC function keys, 
you will lose the F8 key code my program put there. If you try 
to use the TELCOM F7 key after this has happened, you might crash 
your computer as it tries to execute the non-existant code in 
BASIC key F8.
    I suggest that you type in the program, run it, then save 
it to cassette so you can easily reload it in the event the Basic 
F8 key is reassigned.
