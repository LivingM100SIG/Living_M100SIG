		     M100 Memory to Motorola S-Records (Hex)

	Note:  The  MOTOHX  program and associated documentation are  re-
	leased  for  personal  use by Compuserve  M100SIG  members  only.

	MOTOHX  creates  Motorola S-Records from the  M100  memory.   Its
	intended purpose is to program EPROMs.   The program is set up to
	create S2 records,  or 24-bit addresses.   16-bit address,  or S1
	records, can be created by simple chages to the program.


			       Running the Program
			       -------------------

	The program asks four questions.  Typical input is shown below:

	Beginning Address ? 52300
	Ending Address ? 62960
	Load Address ? 0
	S-Record Filename ? PS.HEX

	The  beginning  and ending addresses are the area of M100  memory
	that are to be converted.   The load address is where the data is
	to start in the EPROM (or device being programmed).  The S-Record
	filename is the name of the M100 file where the S-Records are  to
	be stored.  All numeric values are radix 10.

	In the example above, a machine language program residing in high
	memory is to be converted to hex.  The binary data will be loaded
	starting at address 0 of the EPROM.   The hex data will be stored
	in the file PS.HEX.

	The output of the program has been used on a Data I/O programmer.


				16-bit Addresses
				----------------

	MOTOHX generates 24-bit address (S2 records).  Since the M100 has
	a  maximum  of 16 address bits you may want to change  to  16-bit
	addresses, depending on your EPROM programmer.  Change the string
	"S2"  in line 150 to "S1".   Also delete the string "00"+ in line
	118.
