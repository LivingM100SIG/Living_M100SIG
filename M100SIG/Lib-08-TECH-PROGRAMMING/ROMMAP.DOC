   This program is a print formatter for Robert D. Covington's ROM and
RAM Memory Map files.
   It is highly recommended that you change your CIS default setting to
"Blank lines are sent" while downloading the data files (100ROM.RC0 through
.RC6 and 100RAM.RDC).  This allows the program to place page breaks inbetween
blocks of information, rather than splitting the explanation of one address
on two pages.
   You should put your printer in 12-pitch (elite) mode if possible before
starting the program.  I don't think any lines are more than 80 characters,
but it will fit better on the page in 12-pitch.
   Most hex addresses will be printed with their decimal equivalents in
the left margin.  Handy for Basic programming.
   If you specify part 0 to part 6 for .RC0 to .RC6 files, the pages will
be numbered 0.01 0.02 0.03 ... 1.01 1.02 ....  I called the RAM file part
7.
   You end up with about 61 pages for the entire memory map.
