     The following is description of the proceedure I used to
     store my BA, DO, and CO files in EPROM so they could be
     easily loaded after a cold start. This has been done
     sucessfully on both a Model 100 and a 102. It would probably
     work on a 200 but it has not been tested.

The Hardware-

   Tandy National Parts has a small circuit board (pt. #  AXX-
   7113) that is necessary to adapt the pinout of a standard
   27256 eprom to the socket of the option rom. It costs about
   $10.00, and can be ordered thru your local Radio Shack store.
   You will receive three small pieces. A circuit board, a spacer
   and a nylon strap. The spacer goes on the underside of the
   board and the strap goes between the eprom and the board. It
   is possible to mount a very low profile 28 pin socket on this
   board so that you can remove the eprom for reprogramming. If
   you do this, however, the cover will not fit back over the
   opening.

   The way this board is designed there are 14 plated thru holes
   on either side. The board has been cut directly thru the
   holes, exposing them so they will make contact with option rom
   socket. I would suggest filling each of these openings with
   solder so they will make better contact and last longer.

The Software-

   The basic concept that I used was to take a snapshot (memory
   image) of the ram after all programs that I would use had been
   loaded. This snapshot would be stored in the eprom so that
   after a cold start it could be copied back into the ram
   without having to reload it from cassette or disk.

   Since the eprom is 32k and the ram is 32k it would not be
   possible to store all of the ram and still have room for a
   transfer program. I discovered that there are 3 major areas
   that have to be saved inorder to restore the computer to
   previous operating state. They are; an area from maxram to the
   end of memory, a small area just below himem, and the file
   area.

   The first area, maxram (F5F0h) to the end of memory (FFFFh)
   contains all of the directory entries as well as most
   operating system parameters. Also in this area is a flag to
   indicate an option rom is present. If the name of the option
   rom is to appear in the directory after a cold start then this
   location will have to be changed. The location is F62Ah, in a
   Model 100 it must be set to FFh, in a Model 102 it must be set
   to 00h. If you have any machine language programs that have
   been loaded just below maxram they can be saved at the same
   time by moving the beginning address down to include them.

   The second area that must be saved is approximately 560 bytes
   just below himem. The exact purpose of this area is not well
   documented but it has to be saved or this proceedure won't
   work.

   The third area is the file area from the beginning of ram
   (8000h on a 32k machine) to the end of the last file (pointed
   to by the data stored at FBB2h). You should make sure that the
   paste buffer and any unsaved basic programs have been
   eliminated by doing a NEW and a CLEAR command.

   Each of these areas are saved by using the SAVEM command.
   Although they could be saved to ram and then transferred out
   to the programmer it is easier to use a floppy disk and save
   them to it first.

   The next step is to determine the size of each of the saved
   areas and where it will be stored in the eprom. We can then
   write a short transfer program to move the three segments back
   into there proper locations in ram. The entry point for the
   transfer program is 00h. Upon entry the first two things it
   should do are disable the interrupts, and set the stack
   pointer to an unused area at FCC0h. On exit we will have to
   jump to a short program in ram that switches back to the
   regular rom and does a RST 0.

   There is a reserved area in the option rom (40-47h) that must
   have two special characters followed by a six letter filename.
   In a Model 100 the letters TC must be in locations 40 & 41h.
   In the Model 102 they must be the letters AB. On a cold start
   the computer will then load the six letter filename into the
   directory. This part is optional since the option rom can also
   be started by the statement CALL 63012 from basic. If you do
   not use the letters TC to activate the option rom it is
   necessary to change the option rom flag in the maxram area. If
   you forget the computer will cold start each time you try to
   activate the option rom.

   After inserting the option rom and performing a cold start the
   menu should appear with the option rom filename right after
   SCHEDL. Move the cursor to the file name and press enter to
   jump to the option rom. If you had a basic program setup as an
   IPL then it will load and execute automatically.
