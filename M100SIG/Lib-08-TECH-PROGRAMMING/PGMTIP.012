Some of the BASIC commands cannot be executed to a device with PRINT# statement.
One of them is FILES command, which displays the RAM directory on the LCD.

When accessing my host M100 by phone, I need to see what's on my Chipmunk disk 
from the remote M100, but If I just issue LFILES command on the host 
computer, the disk directory is printed only on the host's LCD, and if I do 
PRINT#2,LFILES, I get a syntax error, but using the following technique, the 
host can send it to any devices I open with OPEN statement.

For example, I use #1 and #2 for input and output devices and want to send the
disk directory to the modem line.


     10 MAXFILES=2
     20 OPEN "MDM:7I1E" FOR INPUT AS 1
     30 OPEN "MDM:7I1E" FOR OUTPUT AS 2
     40 A=64652
     50 B=VARPTR(#1)+65536
     60 C=INT(B/256)
     70 D=B-C*256
     80 POKE A,D: POKE A+1,C
     90 LFILES
    100 POKE A,0: POKE A+1,0
    110 LFILES


Note that #1 in VARPTR statement in line 50 indicates the device number, and 
substituting #2 also works.  Pokes in line 80 enable LFILES command in line
90 to be sent to the MDM, pokes in line 100 disable this function, and LFILES
in line 110 will appear on the host's LCD.  You can also use this routine for
COM: or any other devices the M100 lets you open.

This routine also works for RAM files by substituting FILES command instead of 
LFILES.

To output the RAM directory to a .DO file in RAM, change line 20 to
OPEN "RAM:FILE.DO" FOR OUTPUT AS 1 and delete line 30.  Running it will create
"FILE.DO" which contains the disk directory.

This routine was tested on the M100 only.
