Machine Language programs, which have a .CO file extension, require that the
program load and run in a specific RAM location, for which the program was
designed when it was written.  When you select a .CO program from the menu and
try to run it, sometimes it will not run, and instead will BEEP and return 
to the menu.

This apparent failure will occur when the memory location that the program 
needs to run at, is not properly reserved for the execution of the 
program.  This is done to protect the computer so it doesn't load the .CO 
program into an area of RAM that the computer is using for its own 
"operating system" (ie. stack operations, file buffers, etc.).

To overcome this problem, the correct amount of RAM can be reserved before 
any attemp to run it.  Another option is to have a small BASIC program CLEAR 
the appropriate RAM and then RUNM the program you want to run.  This would 
require a "loader" program for each HIMEM .CO program you want to run.

The solution to this problem is to have one "loader" program, which will adjust
the reserved RAM, and run any .CO file.  This "loader" program (RUN.BA) is kept
in RAM, and you put the cursor over the .CO file you want to run.  Instead of 
pressing ENTER, you type RUN.BA <enter> (at the Select: prompt on the menu) and
the .CO program under the cursor will run.

This is very similar to KILL.BA, which allows you to cursor select a file on 
the menu and type KILL to delete it.

Save the following program as RUN.BA.

RUN.BA is used to run HIMEM .CO programs only, and is NOT for ALTLCD programs 
since ALTLCD programs do not require a reserved area of HIMEM to run in.

A utility like CHANGE.BA can be used to remove the .BA extension from RUN.BA,
so after selecting the .CO file from the menu, you only need to type RUN<cr>.
