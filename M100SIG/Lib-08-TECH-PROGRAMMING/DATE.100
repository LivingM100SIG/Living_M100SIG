Model 100 - Time Displays Made Faster and Neater
by Terry Kepner
    Rather than typing PRINT DATE$;" ";DAY$;" ";TIME$ 
to get your program to display the current date and time, here is 
a shorter and faster method of getting the same result: CALL 
10161,,64904 (the double commas are required, leave one out 
and you will get TWO error messages of "OV Error"). This is really 
only two bytes shorter in memory than the previous method, but it 
is quicker to type in and gives a better result. 
    Unlike the DATE$ command, which displays the current date 
in MM/DD/YRformat, the CALL displays the date the same 
way it is displayed on the menu. That is, if the current date is 
August 2nd, 1985, the DATE$ command displays it as 
08/02/85 while the CALL displays it as Aug 
02,1985. Plus, the CALL tacks on the day of the week and 
current time.
    If you only want the day of the week and time displayed, 
use CALL 10161,,64916. And for just the time, 
CALL 10161,,64920. If you want a space in front of 
either of these, decrease the call address by one (i.e., 
CALL 10161,,64915 or CALL 10161,,64919. In 
any case, typing PRINT DAY$;" ";TIME$ or PRINT 
TIME$ takes less room in RAM (but takes longer to execute).
     One thing to consider when using this poke is that it leaves the 
cursor at the end of the line instead of bumping it to the next 
line. So, anything else you want to print will immediately 
follow the date/time message.
