
BUG REPORT - fair warning!
1) Fig remembers which screens are in its buffers.  Due to the manner that this
is done fig thinks that the first disk block (128 char) of screen 1 is in 
memory after a cold start, a warm start, EMPTY-BUFFERS etc..  This means that 1
LIST will often show the first two lines as blank when they are not.  If you 2 
LIST 3 LIST (or something similar) you'll fill the internal buffers with 
something other than screen one then 1 LIST will work fine.  LOAD  will 
MISBEHAVE in a similar fashion, makes a mess!
2) This is not exactly the same editor that is described in "Starting FORTH" 
although it's very close.  "S" works differently here.  "M" has a bug that I 
haven't yet identified.

Oh, by-the-way, a FIG4TH screen is 16 lines of 64 characters each.  That is 
literal!

OK, now, just what do all those new words do?

The cursor referred to below is the EDITOR's cursor, displayed as |.

X	eXtract	( -- )
Copies the current line into the INSERT buffer, and removes it from the screen.
  All following lines are moved up, line 15 is blank.

T	Type	(n -- )
Type line n from the current screen.  Set the cursor to the start of the line. 
About the only way to do that.

L	List	( -- )
Like the FORTH word LIST but obtains the screen number from the user variable 
SCR.

N	Next	( -- )
Increments the current screen number by one.

B	Back	( -- )
Decrements the current screen number by one.

P	Put	( -- )
P text
Any following text will be copied into the INSERT buffer.  The INSERT buffer 
will be copied into the current line, replacing its previous contents.  If the 
text consists of one or more blanks the current line will be erased.

WIPE	wipe	( -- )
Erases the current screen.

COPY	copy	( from, to -- )
Copy one screen to another.

F	Find	( -- )
F text
Any following text is copied into the FIND buffer.  The contents of the FIND 
buffer are compared to the contents of the current line.  If a match is found, 
the line is displayed with the cursor positioned just after the end of the 
search string.  If no match is found the search string is echoed to the screen 
and the error message "NONE" is output.

E	Erase	( -- )
Erases backward from the cursor by the number of characters in the FIND buffer.
  Use after the F command.

D	Delete	( -- )
D text
Any following text is copied into the FIND buffer.  The D command is a 
combination of the F and E commands.

TILL	Till	( -- )
TILL text
Any following text is copied into the FIND buffer.  Starting from the current 
cursor position TILL searches for a match with the contents of the FIND buffer.
  If a match is found TILL deletes all the text on the line from the current 
cursor position up to and including the end of the matched text.

S	Search	( last scr#+1 -- )
S text
Any following text is copied into the FIND buffer.  Starting at the top of the 
screen and continuing to the end of the "last screen" S searches for a match to
the FIND buffer.  Whenever a match is found the line containing the match is 
typed out along with the line number and screen number.

I	Insert	( -- )
I text
Any following text is copied into the INSERT buffer.  The I command copies the 
INSERT buffer into the current line at the cursor position.  Text to the right 
of the cursor will be pushed to the right and will be pushed off the line and 
lost if the length exceeds 64 characters.

U	Under	( -- )
U text
Any following text will be copied into the INSERT buffer.  The screen is spread
at the line just below the current line leaving a blank line.  All following 
lines will be pushed down.  Any text on line 15 will be lost.  The INSERT 
buffer will be copied into the blank line and that line will become the current
line.

R	Replace	( -- )
R text
Any following text will be copied into the INSERT buffer.  The R comand is a 
combination of the E and I commands.  To be used after a find command.

M	Move	( block#, line# -- )
Any following text will be copied into the INSERT buffer then M copies the 
INSERT buffer to the block specified UNDER the specified line.  The original 
block number is restored and the next line becomes current.  HAS A BUG

| 		( -- )
Character is SHIFTed GRPH - (chr$(124) 7C H).  Used as a terminator for all 
commands allowing text input, such as P, F, R etc.  Allows more than one 
command on a line.  Don't use | in any text to be put on the screen!

WHERE	Where	( -- )
A FORTH word, not an EDITOR word.  Use when a compile time error occurs during 
loading.  Converts the block # to a screen #, makes that screen current and 
prints the line in which the error occurred.  The cursor is printed under the 
line in error to show the approximate location of the error.  Enables the 
EDITOR.  Neat word, thanks.

We give many thanks to S.H. Daniel, the author, and the FORTH INTEREST GROUP 
for publishing this version of the editor used in "Starting FORTH".  As line 
editors go, it's not bad!  Published in "FORTH DIMENSIONS" Vol III/3 page 80 
ff.  Public domain, but I expect the author reserves some rights.  The high 
level MATCH words are by Peter Midnight and were part of the above article.
There is a lotta good stuff in FORTH DIMENSIONS.  After you join the FORTH 
INTEREST GROUP maybe you should buy the back issues.  Check around there may 
well be a local chapter of FIG.

GoFORTH and enjoy.   Dave Rowell
