TCOMP.DVI  fix#1
 
An error has crept into TCOMP.DVI. It is a typo, and not a logic error. Line 7400 erroneously prints out the error line instead of the error. It should read: 
 
   7400 BEEP: PRINT "SYSTEM ERROR #";ERR;"OCCURED IN LINE #";ERL
 
   CHECKSUM:3,884
 
 
TCOMP.TDD already has this fix. Sorry for any inconvenience.
