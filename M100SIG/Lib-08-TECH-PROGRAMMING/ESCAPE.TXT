            A Special Note on Model 100 Escape Codes...

The Model 100 supports certain Escape Codes that allow a host system to perform
LCD control functions. These include cursor positioning and various other 
operations (i.e., clearing the LCD, entering or ending reverse video, etc.). 
Although the Escape Codes are primarily remote functions executed by the host, 
you can also use them from a BASIC program or TELCOM's Terminal Mode (when 
connected to another computer).

The Escape Code for cursor positioning is:

<ESC> <Y> line code character  column code character

Where "line code" and "column code" are the following table:

The remaining Escape Codes are listed in the table below:

           Esc.   Dec.                                                         

ESC        Char.  Val.  Explanation                                            

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHR$(27)    A      65   Moves the cursor up one line from its current position.

CHR$(27)    B      66   Moves the cursor down on line from its current
                        position
CHR$(27)    C      67   Moves the cursor one space to the right.
CHR$(27)    D      68   Moves the cursor one space to the left.
CHR$(27)    H      72   Moves the cursor to the top left corner of the LCD.
CHR$(27)    J      74   Erases from the cursor position to the end of the LCD.
CHR$(27)    K      75   Erases from the cursor position to the end of the line.

CHR$(27)    L      76   Inserts a line where the cursor is positioned.
CHR$(27)    M      77   Deletes a line where the cursor is positioned.
CHR$(27)    P      80   Turns the cursor ON.
CHR$(27)    Q      81   Turns the cursor OFF.
CHR$(27)    T      84   Sets the system line.
CHR$(27)    U      85   Resets the system line.
CHR$(27)    V      86   Disables the LCD.
CHR$(27)    W      87   Enables the LCD.
CHR$(27)    Y      89   Moves the cursor to a position specified by a two byte
                        sequence consisting of line code character and
                        column code character. See Cursor Positioning Codes.
CHR$(27)    j     106   Clears the LCD.
CHR$(27)    l     108   Erases entire line where cursor is positioned.
CHR$(27)    p     112   Begins reverse video.
CHR$(27)    q     113   Ends reverse video.

If you intend to use these Escape Codes within a BASIC program, use this 
general format:
       escape code + character value
where escape code is the expression CHR$(27) and character value is the ASCII 
value of any of the above escape characters.  For example, CHR$(112) is the 
character value for the character p:

      Print CHR$(27);CHR$(112)

You can also use the escape character in a simpler format:
      
      escape code + "character"

escape code is still CHR$(27). The escape character can be any permissible 
character as long as it is enclosed between quotation marks. For example, PRINT
CHR$(27);"p" is the escape code for reverse video and is the same as PRINT CHR$
(27);CHR$(112).

To use Escape Codes from the Terminal Mode, it is only necessary to press <ESC>
and then any permissible escape character. You must be careful, however, to 
press the correct form of the character (either upper- or lowercase) for the 
desired results.

Remember...
The Escape Codes are primarily used by a host system to control the Model 100's
display and format the information you receive. However, if connected to 
another computer (either directly, or through the modem), you can send escape 
codes to control the display of the other computer.

 NOTE: The following codes apply ONLY to the monitor/CRT used with Radio 
Shack's Disk/Video Interface.
 ====================
DVI Escape & Ctrl sequences
-----------------------------
ESC I	Cursor up. (note: will scroll screen DOWN if you are at top of CRT)
ESC N	Cursor left (will continue past start of line unlike ESC D)
ESC R	Changes cursor from block 'o'(grph-X) to underline '_'
ESC b	Erases from cursor to BEGINNING of screen
ESC c	Clears screen, sets WIDTH 40
ESC d	Clears screen, sets WIDTH 89
ESC e	Begin FLASH mode (use like ESC p, except charcters FLASH!)
ESC f	End FLASH mode
ESC l	Clear line (clears ENTIRE line regardless of cursor position on line.
ESC n	Prints 'ESCY' lc cc (where lc & cc are the line & column code for the
	current cursor position)(example: if the cursor was on line2, column 5
	you would get 'ESCY!$')
ESC o	Erases to BEGINNING of line
ESC z	Clears screen, sets WIDTH 40
^\	Moves cursor right (right arrow key)
^]	Moves cursor left (left arrow key)
^^	Moves cursor up (up arrow key)
^_	Moves cursor down (down arrow key)

	Remember, these codes are only good if you are using SCREEN 1. (A 
monitor or TV hooked to the DVI)
