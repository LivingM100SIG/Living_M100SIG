            The Tiny Basic Compiler by Mike Weiblen is a major
        advance in M-100 programming. The compiler makes it possible
        to write programs in Basic that will execute at machine
        language speed without the need to learn machine language or
        another high level compiled language. However, TCOMP does
        not accept all keywords in the M-100 Microsoft Basic
        language. Thus, when a Basic program is to be compiled, it
        must be either written especially for TCOMP, or it must be
        rewritten using only the keywords TCOMP recognizes. Poring
        over source code listings, looking for unallowed keywords,
        is a tedious chore.

            TCOMPF does this job for you at lightning-fast machine
        language speed. A 19K Basic program was checked in under
        three seconds, and produced 95 instances of unallowed
        keywords. Using TCOMPF before compiling saves a lot of
        time and eyestrain looking for keywords TCOMP won't compile.

            To create TCOMPF.CO, load the self-contained loader
        program TCOMPF.LDR into Basic. Save it and run it from the
        RAM menu or type "RUN"...don't use F4 (creates a syntax error
        later). It doesn't matter if CDOS is installed, the program
        handles CDOS and reserves memory automatically, and
        re-installs CDOS when finished. If a data byte gets garbled
        in the download, a "not loaded" message will display. The
        download checksum on TCOMPF.LDR is 166,239.

            To use TCOMP.CO, the Basic program to be checked must be
        in RAM as a tokenized (compressed) BA file. At the prompt,
        enter the filename. The extension is optional. Just pressing
        Enter returns you to the menu. When the program is finished,
        it beeps and returns to the menu. There, you'll find a file
        named "LINES.DO" which contains line numbers where unallowed
        keywords were found. TCOMPF stops scanning a line at the
        first occurence of an unallowed keyword, so the lines listed
        may have one or multiple occurences. TCOMPF does not detect
        syntax errors or mispelled keywords. Note: it will pick up
        graphics characters inside quotes as keywords.

            TCOMPF loads and runs at 62448.  If you have a Chipmunk,
        it's OK to run it from disk or from the main menu with CDOS
        installed if you respond "Y" to the "Remove..." prompt. When
        TCOMPF is finished, it automatically re-installs CDOS.
