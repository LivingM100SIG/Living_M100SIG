I recently read both RECHRG.100 and RECHRG.102. Well the failure of Mr. Kaplan
to accomplish this got my curiosity up so I did want he didn't.
My 102 has been "rechargable" for a little while and no bad effects yet!!!
The procedure for accomplishing this is the same as RECHRG.100 with the 
following exceptions.

WARNING: FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN RECHRGE.100 WITH THESE 
EXCEPTIONS WILL RUIN YOUR 102 !!!!!!

WARNING #2: IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SOLDER, NOR KNOW OF ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW
TO SOLDER,DO NOT DO THIS TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL COMPUTER

WARNING #3: THERE IS A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE USED IN THIS PROJECT. EXCESSIVE 
HEAT (SUCH AS A SOLDERING IRON) CAN DESTROY THE DEVICE. ONLY PUT HEAT ON THE 
PROJECT FOR A MAXIMUM OF FIVE SECONDS WITH A ONE MINUTE COOL DOWN TIME.


Add to PROCEDURE (C):Also, unplug the keyboard flat cable and put both the LCD
and the keyboard out of harm's way. Remove the printed circuit board cover (
black fibreboard) and set aside.

Change (D) to: Notice where the Plug-in receptacle is SOLDERED in the upper-
right hand corner of the circuit board. (see picture)

Change (G) to: Wrap the diode/resistor package in electric tape, leaving about
one-eighth inch of the two leads exposed. Solder the resistor lead into #3 and
diode lead into #2.(see picture)

Delete (H)

Congratulations if you've made it this far. Now that the soldering is 
finished,inspect the joints to make sure that they really are firmly 
connected.

PUT THE PROTECTIVE SHIELD IN PLACE AND RECONNECT THE KEYBOARD AND LCD. PUT THE
COVER IN PLACE AND PUT THE FOUR SCREWS BACK IN. PLUG THE A/C ADAPTER INTO THE 
COMPUTER FOR A MINIMUM OF 14 HOURS. IF YOU HANDLED THIS ONE O.K. WRITE ME AND 
I'LL DROP OFF THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PDD2.
