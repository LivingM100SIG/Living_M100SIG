The program allows the user to examine memory contents in a choice of decimal 
format or hex format. Upon initial execution, it is set for HEX and the memory 
pointer is set at 0000H. Simply press the "H" key...then the <ENTER> key.

JUMPING FROM HEX TO DECIMAL
  One can toggle back and forth from the two formats by pressing the "H" or "D"
keys. If <enter> is pressed without entering a location, the program will use 
the same pointer but will switch formats. If a location is entered following 
the prompt Hex? or Decimal? the memory pointer will be adjusted to that 
location.

The program expects decimal addresses in the decimal format and Hex addresses 
in the Hex format. Lower case is acceptable in hex format!

PAGING THROUGH MEMORY
To page through memory simply press the "P" key and the memory pointer will be 
advanced the appropriate no. of bytes. HEX format pages by 48 bytes and 
DECIMAL format pages by 30 bytes.

MODIFYING MEMORY (EDIT)
After pressing the "E" key, the program requests a memory location in the 
current format. If enter is pressed without a location, the current memory 
pointer is used ie. first location on the page. The current memory location is 
printed along with the current contents. To modify memory enter the desired 
change in the appropriate format. The memory pointer is then advanced by one 
byte. To exit the Edit mode, press enter without a new modification.

The ASCII representation of each memory location is also provided.

**** W A R N I N G ****
Do not edit memory unless you know what you are doing...poking into some areas
could result in a cold start for the model 100.
