This program removes unecessary spaces,  eliminates remarks, and concatenates
 lines when possible in BASIC programs in order to conserve RAM.  It requires
 approx. 1.6K + 1.3 times the length of the ASCII file to be compressed in order
 to run.  To calculate necessary RAM space, first save the program to be
 compressed as an ASCII (.do) file, then enter the following line in BASIC:
 
CLEAR 0,MAXRAM:MAXFILES=0
 
The menu will now show how much memory is available for calculation purposes. 
 
When run, CRUSHR.BA will show all files currently in memory and will ask for a
 filename.  The name must be entered complete with the ".do" extender.  
At intervals of approx. 1/3 the duration of the run, CRUSHR.BA will beep to tell you that it is still running.  
 
This program was written with a heavy bias for memory conservation.  (Read:
 dense code with absolutely no in-line documentation)
 
Warning for the faint of heart:  When finished, CRUSHR.BA will kill your file
 and rename the work file as your old filename and then give one final beep. 
 If you want to work on a familiar program, perhaps you should first save it as another filename or to tape.
 
This program loads into 1853 bytes as an ASCII file and requires 1266 bytes in BASIC.
