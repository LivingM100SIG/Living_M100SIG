			--KEY TIP--
	While dissecting DIRACC a few nights ago I came across a clever
 subroutine used by Hugo Ferrerya in his setup routines that enables you to
 "title" a function key without having to remember it's use from the first
 four letters of the command sequence that displays on the label line. 
	For example: normally you would use the following sequence to
set up F1 as CALL60700; KEY1,"CALL60700"+CHR$(13). The only part that you 
see when LABEL is on though is CALL and if you'ld like to have more than one
"CALL" programmed into the function keys you have to remember which is which.
	Ferrerya employs a slightly different method which uses a CTRL X to
 remove preceding characters from the keyboard . In our previous example, if
 that call was for DSKMGR you could program the key: KEY1,"DISK"+CHR$(24)+"CALL60700"+CHR$(13).
Although the key would be labeled DISK on the screen, it begins working AFTER
the CHR$(24), (a CTRL X). In effect you are free to use any four character
title you like just as long the title plus your desired command sequence does
not exceed 15 characters. 

	Remember: "name"+CHR$(24)+10 character command string.


This sure helps me to keep the KEYS straight. I hope it helps you.
