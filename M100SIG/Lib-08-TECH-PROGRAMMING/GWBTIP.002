Another GW-BASIC tip:

If you're attempting to convert Model 100 family BASIC programs to run under
GW-BASIC, you may find a problem in converting the Model 100 PRINT@ statements
to the corresponding LOCATE X,Y notation used in GW-BASIC.

The below program makes such conversions rapidly, assuming you have one of the
Model 100-type computers to run it in.  It runs in any; the 100, 102 or 200.

Simply type in the number following the PRINT@ statement, and it returns the
Row and Column numbers needed in the GW-BASIC LOCATE statement.
