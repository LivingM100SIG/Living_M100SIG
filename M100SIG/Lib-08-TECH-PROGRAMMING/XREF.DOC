.   Interesting and useful utility for
programmers, byte fyters, and other 
kooky types. XREF.EJ works on a .DO version of any BASIC program, to 
produce two lists:
.
1) All variables used in the program,
.   and the line numbers in which they
.   appear.
.
2) Line references... lines to which
.   execution branches, and a list of
.   the lines which send it there 
.   (through GOTO, GOSUB, etc.)
.
   All output is contained in a file
named 'VARLST.DO'.  Be aware an inter-
mediate file 'OUTPUT.DO' is created and
killed.
.
   The program is just under 3900 bytes
in .BA form.  It requires a fair amount
of free space.  I've XREF'ed 4 and 5K
programs easily.  Was never able to do
MINIVC.WM (12K) without running out of
memory in my 32K Mod100.  But I didn't
clear other programs either.
.
.   Run it... type in program name to
be XREF'ed, and sit back and watch.
.
   I'm almost afraid to leave this one.
I've played with it for several weeks, 
and run it against numerous programs 
from the SIG.  It APPEARS solid.  It's
a bit slow, but faster than manual 
work.  Takes about 3 minutes per K of
.DO program.
.
.   Possible Gotcha's MIGHT be 
variable names longer than 5 characters
(which I doubt sane 100 owners use)...
unconventional techniques ( I found
" A$B$F$ " in one prog. which reads as
one variable)... ON GOSUB 1,2,,,4,5 
reads two blanks as variables.  
.
.    In case of trouble, my phone is 
in Stockholm, 1-111....    !
.
.   Seriously,    enjoy... Ed Juge
