   NINE YEARS AGO, PROCESSOR TECH, RELEASED THIS ASSMEBLER TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
   AFTER THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS, MANY OTHER COMPANYS CONTINUED TO GIVE IT AWAY.
   SINCE THIS ASSEMBLER IS FOR THE 8080, WHEN OTHER MORE ADVANCED CPUS BECAME AVAILABLE IT WAS MORE OR LESS FORGOTEN.
   THE 8080 AND THE 8085 USE EXACTLY THE SAME NMONICS.
   THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE 8080 DOES NOT HAVE THE SIM AND RIM NMONICS.
   IF YOU NEED SIM AND RIM USE THE MACRO COMMANDS EQU AND DB (EQUATE AND DEFINE BYTE).
   THE COMMANDS CANBE SPLIT UP INTO 4 DIFFERENT AREAS.
   FIRST IS THE MONITOR COMMANDS.
      DUMP XXXX YYYY
      ENTR XXXX
      YY YY YY YY /
      EXEC XXXX
   DUMP IS A HEX DISPLAY.
      ANY KEY TO STOP DISPLAY.
   ENTR IS ENTER INTO MEMORY.
      AN <ENTER> DOES NOT END ENTRY.
      / THEN <ENTER> DOES.
   EXEC IS JUMP TO HEX ADRESS XXXX.
   THE SECOND AREA IS THE FILE COMMANDS.
      CLRF CLEARS THE FILE AREA.
         USE BEFOR SETTING UP A FILE.
      FILE DISPLAYS CURRENT FILE.
      FILES DISPLAYS ALL FILES.
      FILE /NAME/ XXXX SETS UP FILE.
      FILE /NAME/ MAKES FILE CURRENT.
      FILE /NAME/ 0 KILLS FILE.
      SAVE SAVES FILE TO HOST COMPUTER.
      LOAD LOADS FILE FROM HOST COMP.
         300 BAUD.
         7 BIT WORD.
         EVEN PARITY.
         1 STOP BIT.
         X CONTROL ENGAGED.
   THE THIRD AREA IS WORKING WITH THE FILES.
      LIST LISTS THE CURRENT FILE.
      LIST XXXX LISTS FROM XXXX.
         ANY KEY STOPS LIST.
      DELT XXXX DELETES LINE XXXX.
      RENM XXXX YYYY RENUMBERS PROGRAM.
         XXXX IS STARTING NUMBER.
         YYYY IS INCREMENT BY.
      - - - WARNING - - -
      BOTH XXXX AND YYYY MUST BE USED OR FUNCTION WILL DESTROY ALL MEMORY.
      ASSM XXXX YYYY ASSEMBLES FILE, SETING NMONICS TO XXXX, PLACING CODE AT YYYY.
   IF YYYY IS NOT USED THEN CODE IS PLACED AT XXXX.
      ASSME XXXX YYYY SAME AS ASSM, BUT, LISTS ONLY ERROR LINES.
      XXXX LABEL NMONIC OPERAND
         PLACES LINE XXXX IN FILE.
         ALL 4 POSITIONS IN XXXX MUST BE FILLED.
         LABEL IS OPTIONAL.
         OPERAND DEPENDS ON NMONIC.
      XXXX * IS A COMMENT LINE.
      ANY LINE CAN OVER WRITE A CURRENT LINE.
      EQU IS EQUATE.
      DB IS DEFINE BYTE.
      DW IS DEFINE WORD (2 BYTES), REVERSE ORDER.
      DS IS DEFINE STORAGE.
      0E000H IS HEX E000
         MUST HAVE LEAD 0 IN FRONT OF HEX LETTER.
      'AB' IS ASCII.
   THE FOURTH AREA IS THE GENERAL AREA.
      COMS DISPLAYS THE COMMANDS, INCASE YOU FORGET.
      MENU RETURNS YOU TO THE MENU.
   AND FINALLY, YOU MUST HAVE THE CAPS LOCK DOWN.
   THE PROGRAM ONLY ACCEPTS CAPITAL LETTERS.
   THIS PROGRAM IS PLACED ON THE SIG FOR 2 REASONS.
   FIRST TO STIMULATE THE USE OF THIS COMPUTER FOR MACHINE LANGUAGE PROGRAMS.
   AND SECOND TO SHOW CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT THIS COMPUTER IS MORE THAT A GLORIFIED TYPEWRITER.
