===========================

Assembled with Custom Software's ASMBLR.CO.

FIND.100 is a very small, very fast ml routine that searches the M100's memory
for a given string, listing each location where the string is found.

FIND.100 is just over 100 bytes long, and it can cover the entire 64K of ROM
and RAM in as little as ten seconds!  It is a handy tool for programmers.

A few notes:

* Loading:  The file FIND.LDR is a relocating basic loader <created with
BASBLD.PW3 in dl8>.  To load FIND just below maxram, clear256,maxram then run
FIND.LDR and just hit enter at the end address prompt.  FIND.LDR creates
FIND.CO, which can be executed from the menu as long as memory is clear.

* Operation:  When you execute the program, you will be prompted for a
search string.  Type the text you want to find, then <ENTER>.  FIND.100 then
scans all of the M100's ROM and RAM for the string <Don't ask me about option
ROMs or expansion RAMs - I've never used them.  Tony?>.  The locations where
your string is found are printed on the LCD, and you are prompted to press the
space bar to return to the main menu.  Simple enough?

* No matter what you type for the search string, you will probably always get
63109 and 65078 as two of your numbers.  <They may be the only two>.  63109 is
the input buffer.  FIND stores your text there while it's searching.  65078 is
part of the LCD memory, and you can see that the string is there!

* FIND.100 is CASE-SPECIFIC.  The text search DOES compare literally, unlike
the normal Find: function on the M100 which is case-independent.  So, if you
search for "MENU", you will get different numbers than if you search
for "Menu".

* Shift-Break aborts the search at any time, in case you get impatient in less
than ten seconds.

* Shift-Break, ^C or a null input at the 'Search string:' prompt will abort the
program.

* ML programmers may want to check out FIND.SRC.  This file contains the Custom
Software Assembler Source code for the program.  FIND.SRC is NOT necessary for
normal operation of the program - average users need not download it.
