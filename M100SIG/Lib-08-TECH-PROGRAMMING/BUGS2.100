Robert Lakin [75755,647] has shed some
light on the printing to RAM problem.
It appears that according to the Model
100 manual, it is not permissable to 
use a variable to define the USING
format. At least all of the examples in
the manual use a literal with USING.
Anyway if you change the variables in
the sample program to literals all
appears to work okay.
.
Bob feels that the problem may have
something to do with the 255 byte limit
for RAM records.
