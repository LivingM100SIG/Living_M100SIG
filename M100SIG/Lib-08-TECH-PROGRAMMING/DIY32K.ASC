     For months I had been coveting the 32K RAM expansion banks available for 
the MEWS, but as the price of the basic machine plummetted it became clear that 
my hopes for a commensurate fall in the price of such add-ons were in vain.  So 
armed with a handful chips, a soldering iron, and complete lack of common sense 
I pried the back off my little friend and began to operate.

     The first step was to decide where and how to place the components.  I 
finally decided that the open area on the back of the CPU board, on the opposite
side of the ROM and expansion sockets was best.  It gave the easiest access to 
the signals I needed, and it was open enough for what I had in mind.      After 
thoroughly studying the schematics for the 100 and looking through the technical
references for the RAM chips I intended to use, I finally settled on a simple 
design which I would be entirely enclosed within the machine.  Leaving the ROM 
and expansion slots.  I also decided, for the sake of simplicity, to use a 
simple slide type switch to change banks.     The work went quickly and I was 
ready for my first try after about three hours.  To my horror the machine was 
totally dead, but after my initial panick I realized the memory power switch was
off, flipping it on I hit the power and was, to my great relef, greeted by the 
normal screen.  Then came the acid test,  I shut off the power and  toggled the 
bank selector.  It worked perfectly, and has continued to do so ever since.     
If you are good with a soldering iron, and don't want to spend more than the 
cost of another machine for addidional RAM in your MEWS, read on.  I am sure you
will find this project both enlightning and rewarding!! 

NOTE!!  I  can  not take resposibility for any  damage  that  may result  from  
this modification,  and I do not warrant that  this document is 100% correct.   
It is correct as far as I  know,  but errors may still exist.

Opening the case
-----------------
     Place your MEWS face down on a clean, static free work surface.  Be sure 
that you are wearing static free clothing (no sweaters etc.).  A humidifier will
also help reduce the potential for static damage.     After turning off the 
memory power, and taking out the batteries remove the four screws that hold the 
bottom of the M100 to the keyboard-display section.  Pressing inwards on the 
sides of the black bottom portion of the case lift it off of the white upper 
portion.  Flip it over onto the work surface, being careful not to strain the 
cables that connect the two halves.  Using a small screwdriver to help pry, 
remove the grey ribbon cable and the power wire that go to the display.  They 
are simply pressed on to sockets on the CPU board.  Similiarly remove the black 
and the white keyboard connectors and set the upper portion of the case aside.

Preparing the memory chips
--------------------------
     Take two of your 8k*8 low power memory chips (toshiba 2364 , 2365 , Hitachi
6264 , or equivelant) and bend pin 20 of one them away from the case at a 45% 
angle.  Place the chip with the bent pin on top of the other, making sure the 
pins are alligned, and that both pin ones are on top of each other.  Using a low
wattage soldering iron gingerly solder all of the pins on the top chip to their 
counterparts on the bottom.  Using your wire wraping tool attatch a four inch 
piece of wire wrap wire to pin 20 of the top chip, and another to the bottom.   
Repeat these steps with the other two chips.  You now have two 16k modules ready
for positioning in the machine.

Preparing the CPU board
-----------------------
     In order to fit the memory into the system you must remove the capacitor C9
and relocate it to the other side of the board.     Using a piece of stiff wire,
or the tip of a pen, as a form make a hook at one end of a piece of 3 inch, pre 
stripped, wire wrap wire and cut off the excess.  Tin the hook with your 
soldering iron and tack solder it to pin 1 on the back of the rom socket (
conveniently silk screened with pin numbers) with the wire pointing downward.  
Repeat this process for pins 2-20 and 24-26.

Installing the RAM chips
-------------------------
     Using a dollop of silicone RTV glue, attatch the two memory modules to the 
CPU card with the pins upward and the pin ones towards the top of the board.  Be
sure that the bent out pin 20 does not touch the adjacent module or any traces 
on the CPU board.  After the glue has dried thoroughly take 27 pieces of one 
inch pre stripped wire wrap wire and, using your wire wrap tool, attatch all of 
the pins on module 1 with their counterparts on module 2 with the exception of 
pins 20.  Finally attatch pin 14 to pin 22 on either module.     Using the 
connection chart (figure 5) attatch the wires from the back of the ROM socket to
the proper pins on the RAM chips.  Remember, with the chips in this 
confuguration pin 1 is on the upper right.  Routing is your major concern.  
Since the two modules are interconnected 1 for 1 run your wires to the pin 
number indicated on whichever module allows the neatest path.

Installing the address decoder
------------------------------
     Now you are almost done.  Just the address decoder must be installed.  
Using your silicone glue attatch a 40139 or 74hc139 cmos dual 1 of 4 decoder to 
the cpu board next to IC M5.  Using connection chart (figure 6) wire in the 
decoder.     Attatch pin 28 of the memory module to the output (end with the 
band) of diode D22.

Adding the bank select switch
-----------------------------
     Using a non-shorting SPDT slide switch, attatch three pieces of wire wrap 
wire long enough to reach from the decoder IC to a convenient place on the case.
  I chose a location just next to the modem control switches but you may choose 
your own location.     Attatch the common lead of the switch to pin 13 or 14 of 
the decoder (these two pins should be tied together and to pin 6 of M4).  Then 
attatch one of the leads to Vdd (I used pin 16 of the decoder) and the other to 
gnd (I used decoder pin 8).  When the switch is selected to ground you will be 
running out of your new bank,  when it is set to Vdd you will be using your 
original ram.

The moment of truth
-------------------
     Making sure that the leads of your bank select switch aren't touching 
anything, temporarily re-attatch the keyboard and the display.  Don't try to put
the  halves of the system back together yet though.  Just re-install the 
batteries and turn the memory power back on.  With the bank select switch set to
Vdd turn on the system power.  Now peek at the screen.  You should see the usual
screen.  If you see nothing turn off the power immediatly and check your work.  
now turn the system off and switch banks.  Turn the system back on and look 
again.  If you see the normal screen you are all set.  If not check your work 
again.

Closing the case
----------------
     In order to close the case you will have to fold the pins on the memory 
modules over onto the bottom of the chips.  Then cut a small notch on the side 
of the black portion of the case and attatch the memory select switch.  Close 
the case and you are ready to go.     I found this project most enjoyable, but 
be advised this is definitley not a project to be attempted by the novice.  You 
should have experience in handling CMOS circuits, soldering, and wire wrapping. 
A more than passing understanding of the circuits involved is also helpful.  One
final warning,  it goes without saying that you will void your warranty by doing
this. But if none of this scares you, you should find this an enjoyable, and 
very worthwhile project.
