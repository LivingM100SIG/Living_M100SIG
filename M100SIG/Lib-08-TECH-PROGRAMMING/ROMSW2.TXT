         ROM switching, extRAM and the PG Designs SAFE
                             PART II


These two files are a compilation of several threads of correspondence
on how to prevent cold starts when switching among ROMs (and ROM images
in the extRAM).  Much of the discussion concerns the additional
complications introduced by using the PG Designs SAFE ROM bank.  The
beginning of the discussion is in ROMSW1.TXT

Those particular areas need to be remapped, because those are the addresses
that are changed by various commercial ROM's.  Apparently, that area is a set
of machine language instructions that provide access to the option ROM, and
different manufacturers use different techniques to handle the process.
Apparently, as each ROM is initialized, it copies it's own handling routine
into that area.  Remapping the original data from the ROM restores the
cold-start routine so the next ROM has a "virgin machine" in which to load.

Yes, technically, that routine could be used to remap any area, but it is my
understanding that there is no single block of ROM which holds all the data
that goes into the reserved area consecutively.  Some of the addresses in upper
RAM contain flags, pointers, and other bytes that are computed as the result of
ROM operations, then poked into their slots, not "copied intact" from ROM.  I
have no specific data on what goes where, so anyone experimenting is on their
own.

Dear Peter,

   The initialization routine (part of cold start, not warm start) maps ROM
data from 858d through 1001d up to RAM from 62960d through 63103d.

A lot of these locations are hooks that can be grabbed by different ROMs or by
other m/l.  For example, the background timer hook at 62975 is powerful,
because by using it a ROM or CO can get a back door view into the operation of
the system.  But if the routine that the hook points to disappears, or becomes
unprotected, it's a time bomb.

The bytes mapped up from 880 to 915 include a routine that _automatically_
moves the ROM name of a properly configured ROM up onto the menu as a ROM
trigger (file type F0h).  That routine was highly flawed (except for systems
where you want the process of installing the ROM to wipe out the memory!).
Most all of the general-market ROMs skipped that _automatic_ feature and had
the user type in CALL63012 to activate the ROM.  The ROM then would initialize
all its hooks and install its own trigger file.

The best-designed ROMs provide a way for you to turn them and to restore all
their hooks.  Like KILL"UR2"  or KILL"WORD+"  for TS ROMs, or the CALL63012,0,1
for PCSG ROMs.

There is also the famous sequence at 63012, which is the actual ROM trigger
routine. The image of that in ROM is 911, so ROMs like the ROM2 could be
activated by a memorable CALL 911, with no danger of corruption of the RAM
image.  The ROM had to be especially programmed for the program counter to
suddenly materialize at location 916 in option ROM.

ROMs always need a scratchpad ROM for bankswitching & for handling interrupts.
(You do have Mo's book, don't you!?)   _All_ ROMs use the space between 62982
and 63011 for scratchpad.  They usually also modify the code from 63012 to
63013.  So if it is not set back to its original value, it sometimes can't
trigger a new ROM you put in when you CALL63012, or worse!

ROMs all in one family (all PCSG, all TS)  use essentially the same scratchpad
format.  Switching within the family without deactivating one ROM before
starting another doesn't usually cause a problem.  (There may be minor
annoyances, like multiple trigger files on the menu)

I don't know if that says anything thay could be useful to you?

Actually, no, I don't have Mo's book.  BASICally, I'm machine-language
illiterate.

Anyway, your message suggests to me that perhaps Tony's (revised) REMOVE.BA
routine should be expanded to remap 62982-63103 (not just 62982-63017) to
include the scratch pad and the 63012 & 63103 addresses, which you said are
also critical.

What say you?

Dear Peter,

Which ROMs are giving you problems?  All of them, or just when switching from
brand X to brand Y?  (Buicks to Beemers--buy yourself metric tools.  Camels to
Kools--its _your_ problem!)  You definitely have to be more careful when
switching brands than when going between members of the same family.  But some
people are switching ROMs between, say UR2 & Super, with no stability problems.

Do the cold starts occur exactly when switching ROMs, or do they occur more
sporadically, at random moments in time in the multiROM environment?  I guess
my question is, how do you know specifically that it is ROM switching that
causes the cold starts?

Well, to tell you the truth, it's been a while since I've tried to do too much
switching around, partly because I've been using my DOS box more and partly
because the cold starts were making me so nervous I just gave up trying to
switch very much.  I tried calling 32454, and running Tony's utility
religiously, but the crashes continued.

So that everyone knows what hardware we're talking about, my current setup
consists of a 32K M100 with an additional 96K courtesy of a PCSG RAM expansion,
and a SAFE with TS-RANDOM, Cleuseau/ROM2,   SuperRom, a write protected extRAM
(used to store often used utilities), and T/WORD+Sardine (4 ROM set).

The biggest cold start generator is Sardine, which seems to be incompatible
with everything.  Switching back and forth between Cleuseau and the extRAM when
working on the bank of programs in the extRAM seems to be okay, but throwing SR
into the picture leads eventually to a crash.  As I recall, the crashes
generally don't occur immediately.    They're more like a time bomb; I never
know exactly when they're going to occur.  I guess I know it's the ROM
switching that does it because I'm not doing anything else that's dangerous.

Perhaps there is some interaction with the PCSG RAM expansion like the one with
the NODE that Paul discusses in his letter that appeared in the 2/89 issue of
P100.  There also may be some conflict with the SAFE's ROM switching code.

Does this suggest anything to you?

Paul,

Some time ago, when you were nice enough to create that 26 byte DOS100.CO
routine that automatically switches to the TS-DOS bank in my SAFE, you said
that PG Designs's ...

"ROM.BA program can cause problems and I suggest you use the ROMPAK program,
which should correct the oversights in ROM.BA."

You also said that ...

"ROMPAK ... does not address the unique SuperROM startup,"

and ...

"The ROMPAK program may also offer an occasional problem with a multi-RAM bank
setup, because the ROM and RAM switching use the same i/o port.  So when you
switch ROMs there may be some conflict in port configuration."

So, first, what are ROM.BA's oversights?  Second, does ROM.BA address
SuperRom's trigger files any better than ROMPAK?  And third, does either Tony's
routince or CALL 32454 solve the i/o port conflict, or is that yet another
hurdle to overcome?

Pierre

Pierre - FIRST, one oversight in ROM.BA is that it does not make the CALL
32454, which ROMPAK (I believe) does.

SECOND, neither ROM.BA nor ROMPAK properly deal with the unique requirement of
SuperROM, and I don't believe the problem was of a serious nature.  I seem to
recall that when switching to the SuperROM, an unwanted filename was imposed
upon you, but you could back out of Super and re-enter the ROM via a valid
trigger file.  Nothing serious, but annoying nonetheless (at least it wasn't
serious in the Tandy 200).

THIRD, neither Tony's routine (which I am not very familiar with) nor the CALL
32454, deal with bank switching i/o port conflict.

The word "conflict" may not really convey the true nature of the problem.  To
switch banks, you send a byte to a particular i/o port (E8h).  The
configuration of that byte determines the RAM or ROM bank the M100 will switch
to.

The software that switches RAM banks, was not designed to consider that
multiple ROMs might have been used in different banks, leaving hooks in place
when switching to another RAM bank, and perhaps a different active option ROM
when returning (a potential time bomb).

And yes, there are probably other problems to overcome.  I just don't know
enough about the M100 multi-RAM bank setup to point out these problems, or
offer complete detailed support..... Paul

Dear Peter,
  It would be safe to reset all the stuff between 62960 up to 63103 back to the
default values brought up from ROM.  However, that is overkill.  It's best to
reset only the areas that are actually altered by the ROM in question.
Otherewise, all other CO programs you have that use hooks in that area will
also have to be reinitialized. Maybe that is not too high a price to pay for
the security of clean ROM switching.  It shouldn't be hard to write a short
program in BASIC that compares the default values in ROM to the current value
in RAM, and prints a report of all the differences.  Then you could initialize
the system area, install and activate a ROM, and then run the analysis program
to see what areas were affected.  The nagging suspecion would be that there is
an additional byte lurking somewhere in the system RAM that the ROM developer
decided to co-opt and not tell anybody about!

Hi Tracy,

I tried a variation on the experiment you proposed.  I PEEKed the codes from
62960-65535 out the serial port into my DOS box after installing each of my
ROMs.  I then loaded each file into WordPerfect and did a document compare.  It
turns out that the ROMs change the contents of addresses all over the place in
the system area, not just between 62960-63103, and not just in the ALT LCD
buffer, which we know some ROMs use.

It also turns out that using Tony's routine to reset the addresses between
63018-63103 screws up something or other if you're running a program in BASIC.
Specifically, I got an unlisted line number error in a line that pointed to a
valid line number when the routine ended and tried to RETURN control to another
line.  Oh well.  So you're right,    there are _lots_ of additional bytes
lurking in system RAM that the ROM developers co-opted.

One more piece of trivia.  Among other areas, some of the ROMs alter 65534 and
65535.  It turns out that PCSG's RAM expansions use these addresses for bank
switching - at least in the one liner that you use when you don't have RAM+
installed.  This and Paul's comment about an i/o port 'conflict' at E8h (232d)
sound like serious trouble.  Do you have any words of wisdom on this point?  Do
you think things will be easier with the Jumbo extRAM?

Dear Peter,
  Some of those changes you saw would be due, _not_ to installing the ROM, but
to the process of returning to the MENU and running your BASIC scan program.
There would be changes in the screen buffer and in the altLCD buffer (menu
selection uses high bytes in altLCD) and also there would be changes due to
operation of the clock interrupts etc.  Running BASIC would change lots of
system locations.  A m/l program would change less.  But I guess it's not easy
to separate out the changes that are due to the ROMs per se.

  You mentioned that resetting the area from 63018-63103 causes your BASIC
program to lose its place.  The current line number for a running BASIC program
is stored at 63098, and there are other BASIC pointers in that area of memory.
Certainly resetting them from a running BASIC program would have the effect you
noted.  Lots of the locations are documented in Covington and in the model T
books.

   I don't understand the comment about the conflict at i/o port 232d, re the
problem with locations 65535, and RAM+??

  What role does the extRAM play in this?  I've kind of lost track of how
extRAM fits into your system.  You said that most of your cold start problems
occur when you use the Sardine 4-rom set, which I believe you have in the Safe.
You have an archive of your own files in the extRAM, not a ROM image.  When you
use the extRAM, do you switch banks, or do you use the other file and data
commands?  The XR4 will be about the same in the way it handles data.  It will
have a write-protect feature in software, but I don't see how that affects what
you are doing.  hmmm..

Hi Tracy,

My comment about the i/o port relates to something Paul said in message #40296:

"The word "conflict" may not really convey the true nature of the problem.  To
switch banks, you send a byte to a particular i/o port (E8h).  The
configuration of that byte determines the RAM or ROM bank the M100 will switch
to.

"The software that switches RAM banks, was not designed to consider that
multiple ROMs might have been used in different banks, leaving hooks in place
when switching to another RAM bank, and perhaps a different active option ROM
when returning (a potential time bomb)."

I'm not real hep on stuff at this level, but I read him to be saying that both
the RAM banks and the ROMs are sending conflicting instructions to the same i/o
address.  Also, (and independently?)  some of the changes that I discovered in
system memory that were induced by installing various ROMs are at precisely the
same addresses that are used to switch between PCSG's RAM banks.

As you said, I have an archive of my own files in the extRAM, not a ROM image.
My use of the extRAM is mostly confined to the CALL63012'+  command to bring
programs into RAM.  On the whole, the extRAM has been very troublefree; my cold
starts seem to originate elsewhere.  Thus my hunch (and hope) is that if I
scrap the SAFE and go with my bank of files and a couple of ROM images in XR4,
I may have an easier time than I'm having now _and_ a lighter computer.

Dear Peter,

  I can see that if you install a ROM while a first RAM bank is active, then
swap to a new RAM bank, then install a different ROM, then swtich back to the
first RAM bank, there could be trouble.  The first RAM bank thinks the first
ROM is still installed.  When one of the hooks into that ROM is called, BAM,
Goldilocks is there, not the little Bear, and her reception is icy.
  The four ROM Sardine runs _only_ from the booster pak, doesn't it?

There are two versions of the 4-ROM Sardine.  One for the BP and the other for
the SAFE.

Maybe what I should do is set up an IPL program to clean up my RAM banks each
time upon entry using Tony's REMOVE.BA routine.  What do you think?
