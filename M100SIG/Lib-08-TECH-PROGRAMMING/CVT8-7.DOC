CVT8-7.100 Convert Programs from 8-bit to 7-bit
 
   This program allows you to upload/download a Basic program containing 8-bit 
graphics characters using a regular 7-bit ASCII upload/download.  Lines with 
characters 128 to 255 must be modified if they are to be uploaded in 7-bit 
mode.  CVT8-7 does this by coding these lines and making them into data 
statements.  Line numbers from 65000 up are used for these data statements and 
also for a routine which later puts the program back in its original form, so 
the program to be processed must not contain line numbers higher than 64999.
 
How to use CVT8-7
-----------------
   Save your program as a .DO file.  (Type SAVE"FILE",A or SAVE"FILE.DO")  Run 
CVT8-7.  Your program will be processed and a new file written.

   Lines which contain special characters should be kept a little shorter than 
usual, since CVT8-7 adds to their length.  Characters are divided into three 
ranges: 32-127, 128-191, 192-255.  When any character is in a different range 
than the preceding character a shift character is inserted into the output 
listing, so each such change adds one character to the line.  A line number and
DATA" add another 11 characters to the line length.

   This new file has mixed-up line numbers, so you may wish to LOAD it and re-
save it in ASCII, but don't run it first or it will be converted back to its 
original form.  (You should load it anyway to make sure everything is working 
okay.)

   Lastly, be sure to mention in any program description or documentation you 
upload:
1) The program is self-modifying the first time it is run.
2) It requires an available file slot on the menu for a file called TEMP8B.DO
3) The program listing you upload contains strange character sequences (like 
~{}).  This last one is especially important and should be in the description 
because people will think they're getting a bad download or the file is 
corrupted.  Consider Basic statements like the following:
C$=MID$({ ~(I9Z:[7X|{,P,1)
It sure doesn't look too good, but it translates into a perfectly sensible 
result.
