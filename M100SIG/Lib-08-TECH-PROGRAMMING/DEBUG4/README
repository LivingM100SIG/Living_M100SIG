This package contains the complete suite of files for the DEBUG program for the
TANDY Model 100/102 computer system.  The following files should be present in
this archive:-

DEBUG413.HEX	The ASCII hex file for DEBUG.CO;
DBMAKE.DO	A BASIC program to regenerate DEBUG.CO from DEBUG413.HEX;
DEBUG413.ASM	The assembly language source file for DEBUG;
DEBUG413.DOC	The formatted documentation for DEBUG;
DBCFG.DO	The BASIC program to re-locate the DEBUG.CO file;
README		This file.

In order to use these files, you will need to download DEBUG413.HEX, DBMAKE.DO,
and DBCFG.DO into your Model 100, and perform the necessary conversions.  The
first step is that of recovering the DEBUG.CO file.  Since the Model 100 does
not support a binary file transfer, then you must download the .HEX file and
the DBMAKE.DO program.  Execute DBMAKE and follow the screen instructions. To
avoid a memory conflict, execute the command:-

CLEAR 512,58073

and then RUN DBMAKE.  The program will read the data file and poke the values
in memory.  At the conclusion you will be asked if you wish to save the file,
if you answer YES, then the program will save DEBUG as a .CO file for you. The
DBMAKE and DEBUG413.HEX files are not needed after this conversion.  The DBCFG
program is used to re-locate the DEBUG.CO file so that it can be used at an
address that is different from its base address.  It does so by locating the
DEBUG.CO file already saved to memory and modifying all the absolute address
references to those required at the new location.  It is sufficiently defensive
that it will only work for the file called DEBUG.CO, and only for the version
for which it was generated.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YOU TO MODIFY EITHER
DBCFG.BA OR DEBUG.CO IF YOU WISH THIS PROGRAM TO PERFORM CORRECTLY! FAILURE TO
HEED THIS ADVICE WILL DEFINITELY RESULT IN SEVERE AND IRRECOVERABLE CORRUPTION
OF DEBUG!

As an aid, I have included the source file of DEBUG for your information. Note
however that because of its size, it will only assemble on an IBM or other
machine with sufficient memory, and only with a compatible cross assembler. I
used my own assembler, and the file will almost certainly require at least some
minor "adjustments" in order to assemble correctly in your environment.

The DEBUG documentation file DEBUG413.DOC is already formatted with margins,
page breaks, etc, and can be printed (at least under MS-DOS) with the command:-

COPY DEBUG413.DOC LPT1:

Note however, that on one page there are some IBM Extended ASCII graphics
symbols, and thus your printer must be IBM compatible to print these correctly.
Even if it is not compatible, the rest of the document uses only the ASCII
printable characters, SPACE, TAB, CR, LF, and does not attempt to use BOLD,
EXPANDED, or any other printer dependant function.

This program is also available for the OLIVETTI M10-M (US Version), and can be
found in the appropriate library under the file name OVDBG413.EXE.
