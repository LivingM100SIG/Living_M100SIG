Entering a text file from a Basic program on the Model 100/102

Entering TEXT from Basic is easily done with a CALL 24046.  This gives you the 
familiar "File to edit?" prompt you get from the main menu.  There is also a 
way to enter a predetermined file without requiring the user to type the 
name, but it is necessary to check the directory for the address where the 
file starts.  The following program listing demonstrates how this can be 
done:

10 CLEAR:FILES:INPUT"Filename";T$:T$=T$+SPACE$(6-LEN(T$))+"DO"
200 F$="":N=256:FORM=-1606TO-1408STEP11:L=M+3:IFPEEK(M)THENW=VARPTR(F$):POKEW,8:POKEW+1,LMODN+N:POKEW+2,L/N+N:IFF$=T$THENCALL24421,0,PEEK(M+1)+256*PEEK(M+2)
210 NEXT:PRINT"File not found"

Normally the program would specify the filename as, for example "ADRS  DO" and 
the routine starting at line 200 would follow.  Note that filenames must be in 
capital letters, or the search will fail.

After you've finished editing your text file, F8 will return you to the main 
menu.  The real trick would be returning to the Basic program, but I suspect 
that's much more difficult.

You should be aware that editing a program by adding a line at the "Ok" 
prompt or deleting a line by typing its number followed by the "enter" key does 
not update the directory.  A CLEAR statement at the beginning of your 
program should solve this.  Jumping into a text file part-way through is okay; 
it just means you can't edit the first part of the file, but jumping into a 
Basic or .CO file is likely to be hazardous to your RAM files.
