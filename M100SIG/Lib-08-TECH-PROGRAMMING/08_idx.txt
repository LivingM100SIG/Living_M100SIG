  FNDFIL.100 is a Model 100 Basic program with RAM PEEK's to find the location
  of a menu program in RAM.  Generally used in modified form as a subroutine
  for a utility (e.g., MONTOR.100, DISASM.PW2).  Documented briefly in
  FILFND.DOC.
  Can be made into FNDFIL.200 for Tandy 200 by replacing line 90 by:

  The Model 100 family is based on ROM-ware, permiting basic
  operations without loading software. But ROM routines can be limiting. The
  designers of the firmware provided "hooks" into the ROM routines, so
  programmers can jump out of the ROM program into their own routines, and
  back again. The overwrite programs for the M100/102 and 200 owe their
  existence to use of these hooks. These messages discuss how it works -- plus

            THREAD

  In developing Basic programs, it is often desirable to make the
  program insensitive to the case (CAPS, or not) of data entered from the
  keyboard in response to prompts.  These messages start with the issue of
  adding this feature to a particular program during development -- and move
  on to some pretty detailed and arcane stuff!

  The question of translating a text file from one word processor (WP) to
  another is critical to some applications.  Often it is extremely difficult;
  for example, Multimate creates non-ASCII files.  Other WP's (e.g., Wordstar
  = WS) create ASCII files with some "special features".  This file discusses
  these issues, focusing on Wordstar conversion and the Model
  100/102/200 environment.
