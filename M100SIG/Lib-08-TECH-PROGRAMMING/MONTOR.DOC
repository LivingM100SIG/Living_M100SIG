Documentation for MONTOR.100
----------------------------

MONTOR.100 is a Basic utility for inspecting and patching Model
100/102 menu files.  It is adapted from Joel Hassell's LOOKIT.100
in DL4.  But where LOOKIT asks for a start address in Hex,
 MONTOR asks for a file name and determines the appropriate start
address (using code borrowed from Tony Anderson's RAMDIR.100,
DL4).  Note that MONTOR.100 is not for the Tandy 200 -- although
it could probably be adapted for the 200 by changes in the
directory search routine.

With MONTOR you can look at the contents of any file on the menu
(visible or invisible), starting at the first byte in the file.
The cursor keys, alone and shifted, are used to move you through
the file, slowly or rapidly -- and can be used to move you beyond
the file.  But for general exploration, LOOKIT is a better tool,
since it accepts specific addresses, even if in ROM.

File names must be complete with '.'  and a two-character
extension, but can be upper or lower case.  If you have a file
with no extension (e.g., 0MENU), end it with '.' followed by two
spaces; the program checks for the '.' and for two following
characters.

With MONTOR you can patch programs on the menu directly.  Typing
in hex values will change the value at the cursor position.  This
can be very handy if you know what you are doing -- but
disasterous otherwise!  Experiment first with a DO file.

At any time while "in a file", pressing ESCape takes you back to
the beginning of the program, ready to examine another file.
There ENTER will take you back to the main menu.
