Bin-Hx.Ba is a utility program that lets you convert ML programs in Hex format 
back into ML, or convert ML programs into hex format for Ascii file transfer.
It also gives you option to load the hex into a different address.


To convert hex file into a .Co file, press 'L'.

Be sure you cleared the memory where you want to load the hex file into, with a
CLEAR 200,address.

You will get a 'Data Top? ' prompt.  This is for an area in the ML program
 that is not a runnable code, but just data.
  When relocating, as the program encounters a JMP code, it will give it a new 
value to make it runnable in the new address, but if the JMP code is not really
a code, but just plain numeric data, it shouldn't be changed, and specifying a 
data field will protect the data.  If needed, it should be supplied by the prog
rammer.

If no data field is to be specified, just press ENTER for both 'Data Top?' and'
Data End?'.


When finished loading, enter the file name to save the ML code under.
  If you enter blank, it wil not be saved.



To convert a .CO file to hex, press 'S'.
If you just enter for the 'CO file?' prompt, it is assumed that the ML program 
is not in the file listing, but is in the memory somewhere, and asks you to spe
cify the Top, End, and Exe addresses.



Error messages:

If you get an FF error, the file name you entered does not exist.

EF error either means that the hex file is not in correct format for Bin-Hx, an
d you have to use different converting program that is specifically for that he
x file, or it means that the hex file is chopped off.

OS error means that not enough variable space is cleared.  In that case, type C
LEAR 200 and run it again.

OM error means that there's not enough memory to create a hex file.
