= The M100SIG

This is a "living" version of the great [M100SIG archive](https://archive.org/details/M100SIG)  

The M100SIG archive is a zip file containing much of the files section of the Model 100 Special Interest Group from Compuserve.

It contains a wealth of software and info assembled over many years, but also has been stagnant for decades since it was created.

This is a "living" copy of that archive in the form of a git repository, where the initial commit and the initial "release" contain the unadulterated original M100SIG.ZIP for reference, but going forward from there, updates are allowed to fix old bugs and correct informational errors and fill in information that was still a mystery to someone in say 1988, but is no longer a mystery today.

All information developed since the M100SIG was created has had to be created and hosted in a myriad of different places, and many of those have now themselves expired and the info lost. Meanwhile the M100SIG remains a single huge resource like a library that has persisted since the beginning, even while newer info has come and then been lost again, because the M100SIG is a single, simple, portable zip file that has been copied many places and is easy to keep copying to new repositories.

But a zip file is a static thing, and nothing new has been added to it almost since inception.

However in the intervening time, several forms of revision-controlled repositories have been invented and become standard, and today, a repository is essentially as handy and portable as a zip ort tar file.

There have been other instances of hosting the M100SIG on web sites in an un-packed browseable form, but those were all web sites, operated by an individual for some finite period of time. Currently web8201.net has one, but the individual file links are broken and the site is very inconvenient to link to, so it is inconvenient to use as a reference in other documents. It's essentially not very useful except for the fact that it does have a link to download the whole original .zip. But that is also available from archive.org and several other places. Worse, Roger Merchberger's sites are entirely gone. You can see in archive.org that they used to exist, but many/most of the actual files are gone and were not archived when the web pages were indexed by archive.org, because many of the file links were actually to FTP sites not HTTP, and archive.org did not follow and reproduce those.

The difference here is, this is not a web site, even though you may conveniently access it from a web browser. The content is in fact a generic and perfectly portable set of files that may be cloned in it's entirety just as easily as downloading a zip file, and put up on any other similar web site, if some day github.com becomes unavailable or otherwise unsuitable. And either here or on any other git/hg/svn/etc host, people can resume contributing updates to a common library of knowledge and software, which then outlive any current custodian of the moment.

I do not wish or intend to be the only gatekeeper to updates. I would like at least a few other people to request commit access to this repo so that updates do all have to come ion the form of PR's that I have to review and merge. Updates would still have to come in that form, but there is no reason a fairly large number of people can't share the job of accepting the updates.

The original archival version of this archive is always available from [releases](../../releases) in the first release, or the archive.org link above.
